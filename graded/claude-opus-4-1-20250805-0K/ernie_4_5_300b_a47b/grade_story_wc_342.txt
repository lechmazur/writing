<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's face-blindness drives her unique perception of patterns and textures throughout, with embodied reactions to discovery ("breath caught," "fingers freezing"). The choice to take the safe and preserve knowledge shows clear values hierarchy with visible cost (risking capture by demolition crew). Minor deduction for some telling about the guild member's "ramblings" rather than showing skepticism through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms from commissioned painter to active preserver of knowledge. The cost is legible in her risking the demolition crew's chaos to save the safe. Orientation anchors (oak tree library, demolition at dawn, Lira as painter) established within first 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hollowed oak trunk functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (hidden panel requires specific coin, time pressure from demolition). Sensory detail ("wet soil and old parchment," "damp bark") filtered through Lira's texture-focused perception. The tree's grain patterns mirror constellations, making environment essential to the discovery and final painting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: discovery of indentations → coin alignment → safe opening → journal revelation → demolition beginning. The wrecking ball's first blow forces immediate choice between preserving the painting or saving the safe. Cost visible in abandoning her commissioned work to preserve the guild's true legacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus destruction emerges through concrete discovery of the guild's hidden knowledge system. The line "To mirror the sky inside walls...When the tree falls, let the stars remain" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of Lira walking with "the coin warm in her pocket" resonates as knowledge preserved despite physical destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Lira's face-blindness shaping how she processes the world ("memorized souls through textures and hues"). Some filter verb clusters ("she saw," "she'd intended") slightly dull immediacy. Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though brief moments of elevated diction ("silent hymn to limits overcome") slightly strain the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during discovery moments. Information density high in description of the painting process ("fractally precise spirals," "blending ultramarine and gold"). Some redundancy in final paragraph with "walked on" following established departure, and "heightened stillness" feels somewhat forced as a closing echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle on knowledge preservation through a face-blind artist who reads patterns others miss. The coin-as-key mechanism and star-mapping inside wood grain show specific invention. The transformation from commissioned documentarian to active preserver feels earned through established character traits rather than convenient plotting.</comment>
