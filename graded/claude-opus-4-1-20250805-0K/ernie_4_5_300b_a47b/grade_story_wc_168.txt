<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in survivor's guilt, with concrete embodied emotion (helmet biting brow, throat tightening). The final acceptance/transformation is earned through the hourglass discovery and reflection sequence. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("translate his pain into something universal") and the epiphany feeling slightly too neat, though the cost of carrying trauma is visible throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias shifts from haunted to "enlightened" with the emotional cost of confronting his mother's message. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and sensory details build toward the final acceptance. Deducted for the cost being more felt than dramatically visible in action, though the "I hear you" moment and forest's sigh create resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ridge path functions as threshold space between earth and sky, constraining the journey and enabling the revelation. Vivid sensory work ("frost-laced gravel," "liquid silver" sand) filtered through Elias's firefighter perspective. The hourglass as micro-setting object directly shapes the closure moment when its sand movement synchronizes with acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of self-forgiveness is signaled early and deepens through the hourglass revelation, though escalation is primarily internal/reflective rather than driven by external pressure. The tightening occurs when memories surface and Elias chooses acceptance over continued self-punishment, with emotional cost visible in his rare smile and softened face.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through acceptance emerges organically from the fire/regrowth metaphor and mother's "Time bends for those who listen" message. The ending reweights earlier pain as "fertilizer" without stating a moral. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "fire wasn't just destruction; it was transformation" line, though it's filtered through character realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of a scarred firefighter ("reading the land's breath, anticipating its rage") with controlled psychic distance shifts. Some elevated diction occasionally strains the POV ("celestial bodies pirouetted") but mostly maintains consistency. The narrative stance effectively modulates between memory and present observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("slow and deliberate" echoes effectively). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("choreographed by some unseen hand") and one instance of abstraction ("translate pain into a universal language") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hourglass with frozen sand as mother's coded warning offers a fresh angle on the grief/acceptance arc. The specific detail of a forest herbalist mother and firefighter son creates organic thematic resonance. Somewhat conventional trauma-to-acceptance trajectory prevents higher scoring, though the execution shows genuine emotional specificity.</comment>
