grade_story_wc_388.txt
I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - each discovery leads to the next through because/therefore linkage (finding the journal → reassembling letters → understanding the diamond → making the choice to seal the stillpoint).

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a "truth excavator" drives consistent choices through investigation to sacrifice. Her decision to seal the stillpoint emerges from established traits with visible cost. Internal conflict between truth-seeking and survival plays out in scene, though some interiority relies on stock phrasing ("intuition prickled").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery to closure with clear Decisive Change - Mara seals the stillpoint at personal cost. The flawed/flawless diamond revelation provides meaningful reversal. Cost is visible in the final paragraphs as radiation drops and hope emerges. Minor orientation issue with "three weeks ago" timeline not fully anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radioactive wasteland and thriving orchard create vivid contrast that shapes the central mystery. Setting constrains choices through the fissure chamber and pedestal mechanism. Sensory details like "rust-colored dust storms" and "cold surface biting through her coat" are selective and purposeful. The orchard's transformation at closure charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating disappearance to preventing world-ending catastrophe. The flawed diamond as decoy creates genuine reversal that reframes prior understanding. Mara's agency drives the resolution with visible cost - sacrificing the diamond to save the world. Pressure coheres through discovery sequence leading to forced choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges through action rather than statement. The flawed diamond metaphor - dangerous truth that must be confronted - resonates without heavy-handedness. Final image of Mara continuing to dig despite cost offers non-literal answer to thematic question. Some abstraction in "truth excavator" concept weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with appropriate narrative certainty. Voice modulates effectively from investigative precision to urgent realization. Some filter verb reliance ("Mara's breath fogged") and occasional register drift into academic tone ("trickle of stasis seeping"). Perceptual signature of pattern-recognition is maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("miniature suns amid the rust-colored dust storms"). Template cadence in middle section ("She returned... She spread... She pocketed"). Information density is solid with most lines advancing multiple purposes. Final image effectively recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept and dual-diamond mechanism offer fresh angle on post-apocalyptic setting. Transformation of cursed object trope through scientific framing shows originality. However, the wasteland setting and mysterious disappearance follow familiar patterns without sufficient transformation. Specific detail in the orchard's impossible fertility adds authenticity.</comment>
