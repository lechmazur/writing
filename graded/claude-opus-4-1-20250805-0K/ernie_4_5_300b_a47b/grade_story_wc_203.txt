<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to listen to ghosts and repair their stories is clear and drives the discovery, but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "weightless burden" metaphor carries some embodied emotion, though peak moments lean toward summary ("his chest tight with the weightless burden of understanding"). The final choice to repair stories alongside the elevator shows consistent character logic with implied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias discovers the hidden truth and the ghosts dissolve, with emotional cost visible in "his chest tight with the weightless burden." The accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns and physical details build toward revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines. The discovery-to-understanding arc follows causal logic, though the ghosts' sudden ability to fade after acknowledgment feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office constrains investigation through its crumbling façade and hidden compartments, directly enabling the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cool metal," "blue-gray haze," "peeling laminate"). The ceiling cracks function as both literal and metaphorical portals, charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Elias climbs from floor to counter to ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the ghosts' trapped story—signals early and tightens when Elias discovers the hidden compartment. Escalation occurs through physical investigation (floor→counter→ceiling) with the ghost clown pointing toward resolution. The cost remains primarily emotional rather than forcing a trade-off, and agency manifests through observation and acknowledgment rather than a decisive choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "cracks in the façade" hiding emotional/historical truth, avoiding direct statement. The final image of the less lonely ticket office resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively through the ghosts' gestures and the discovered artifacts. The piece earns its wisdom about acknowledgment through specific discovery rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice shows some distinction in technical observation ("dust accumulation patterns—a swirl here, a ridge there") though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("their weightless burden pressing against his chest like a second skin"). The ghost's single line of dialogue feels natural. Perceptual signature of noticing patterns others miss is established but could be more consistently rendered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures, though some figurative language verges on overwriting ("shadows stretch like old, thin hands"). Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Notable scaffold appears in adjacent metaphors for the ghosts ("weightless burden," "second skin") and some filter constructions ("Elias could feel them"). The "flickering like a heartbeat" simile in the closing strains coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator repair technician and ghost investigation offers a fresh angle, particularly the use of dust patterns as narrative device. The horologist's mainspring barrel adds specific texture though its vibration-measuring function never pays off. The emotional truth of trapped stories needing acknowledgment grounds the fantastical elements. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, though some elements feel more assembled than organic.</comment>
