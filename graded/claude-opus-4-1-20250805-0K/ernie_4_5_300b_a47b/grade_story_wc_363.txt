I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through pattern, repetition, and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore sound through weaving is clear and rooted in inherited purpose. The final sacrifice choice lands with genuine cost ("Her grandmother's bead slipped from her grip"). However, interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("hope that her loom's threads could stitch the world back together") and the emotional progression through the puzzle-solving lacks embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara transforms from weaving cloth to "weaving silence itself," with clear cost (losing the ancestral beads). The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern-building. Minor orientation wobble with the sudden "rummage sale box" appearance feels slightly unmotivated within the established mythic register.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo forest creates atmospheric pressure and the loom acts as micro-setting constraining choices. Sensory detail is selective ("sunlight dripped through leaves like liquid gold"). The amber beads effectively function as setting-objects that shape the final sacrifice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal restoration to village-wide healing, with clear tightening when Mara must sacrifice the beads. The puzzle creates intermediate pressure with pieces vanishing and reappearing. Cost is visible but the middle section's puzzle-solving lacks sufficient resistance before the breakthrough "on a rain-soaked morning."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weaving/silence/connection motif without explicit moralizing. The final image of Mara's name echoing in distant children's laughter offers resonant, non-literal answer to isolation versus connection. The "unraveling tapestry" metaphor effectively threads throughout without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with some lyrical texture ("where sunlight dripped through leaves like liquid gold"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction inconsistent with Mara's perspective ("suffocating hush that smothered laughter"). No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature could be more distinct to Mara's weaver-specific way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from template cadence in places ("Mara believed it. Every night, she pressed it..."). Some paraphrase loops appear ("The message wasn't for her. It was for them"). Mixed metaphor issue with silence being both "woven" and "bloomed" strains coherence. Filter verb clusters appear in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of weaving silence to restore sound offers a fresh angle on sacrifice narratives. The puzzle-as-cipher device feels somewhat derivative but gains specificity through the amber beads' generational significance. Final transformation of Mara into legend shows commitment to premise without retreat.</comment>
