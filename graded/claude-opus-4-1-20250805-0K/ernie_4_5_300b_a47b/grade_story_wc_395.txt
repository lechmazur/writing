Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate it systematically under a **Causal drive lens** - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Lira investigates the cold case, with each discovery narrowing her options toward the final confrontation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent - hunting for truth about Elara's disappearance - and her final choice to upload coordinates and flee shows agency under pressure. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; we get determination but not the cost of her choices. The story relies on competence without genuine struggle until the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain holds well - each discovery leads to the next revelation, culminating in Lira's escape with the coordinates. The closure shows a Decisive Change as she shifts from corporate investigator to fugitive pursuing truth. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract ("her mind racing toward the edge") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear from the opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The digital archive setting effectively constrains choices through access restrictions and security systems. Strong sensory details like "cold light casting shadows" and the tactile patch create atmosphere. The environment directly shapes the conflict when security drones invade. However, the research station location and "edge of the system" remain vague abstractions rather than specific places.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal investigation to corporate conspiracy to physical confrontation. The dominant stake - uncovering truth despite corporate suppression - drives every beat. The pressure tightens when Hale arrives with drones, forcing Lira's choice. The cost becomes tangible as she abandons her position to become a fugitive, though the immediate physical danger could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of institutional erasure versus persistent truth emerges organically through the recurring numbers and deleted files. The patch serves as a physical anchor for memory against digital deletion. However, Elara's video message stating "They're erasing us" comes dangerously close to explicit thematic declaration, and the final paragraph's "make sure the world remembered" borders on moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with tech-savvy diction appropriate to Lira's role. Phrases like "digital echoes" and "ghostly impressions in the system's memory" create a distinct texture. However, some register drift occurs ("oily with false sympathy" feels writerly rather than character-driven), and the dialogue lacks naturalistic subtext - both Hale and Elara speak in overly articulate exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in "Lira knew better. She'd seen the way..." structure. The metaphor "Across the echo of forgotten songs" feels forced and doesn't connect to the digital setting. Some overwriting in phrases like "the sensed absence of information gnawed at her" where simpler language would be stronger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The digital archaeology angle offers a fresh frame for the missing astronaut trope. The recurring numbers as both clue and system artifact is clever. However, the corporate conspiracy and "they're deleting people" revelation feels derivative of familiar sci-fi templates without sufficient transformation. The story doesn't fully commit to its most original element - the intersection of digital and physical erasure.</comment>
