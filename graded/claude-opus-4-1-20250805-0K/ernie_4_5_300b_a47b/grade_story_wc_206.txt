<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through craft-as-truth philosophy drives his choices consistently, and Lira's admission creates genuine cost when she confronts her husband's lies. The covenant's philosophy of "mending what isn't torn" effectively externalizes internal conflict. However, both characters lean toward archetype (wise craftsman, grieving widow) without sufficient individuation, and Lira's transformation feels slightly rushed given the story's philosophical weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the resonance chamber amplifying truth-telling as the central mechanism. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira's admission restores the music box, with visible cost in her confronting painful truth. The covenant's philosophy drives causality effectively, though the transformation mechanics ("tethering") could be more precisely dramatized rather than explained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber functions as active setting, its copper walls and runic dais constraining how repair must proceed. Sensory details like "air shimmered with residual sound" and "threads of spun starlight" create atmospheric specificity. The chamber's amplification of truth directly shapes the climactic choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mechanical repair to moral reckoning as Elias reveals the box requires truth rather than technical skill. Lira's admission "I knew he lied about the mine" carries genuine cost in acknowledging complicity. The pressure coheres under the textural lens through accumulating revelations about the stone's nature, though the single confrontation point limits deeper escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the covenant's creed and the stone-as-mirror metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the box playing "between past and present, loss and hope" offers resonant closure without stating lessons. The concept that "midnight steals light by convincing us to hide our shadows" provides philosophical depth while remaining grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent philosophical-fantastical register with distinctive phrases like "infected by midnight" and "threads of spun starlight." Dialogue carries appropriate formality for the world while advancing plot through subtext. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("syrup of sound") that slightly strains the craftsman POV, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "ghosts of forgotten harmonies" and concrete tool descriptions. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("mending what isn't torn" concept restated multiple ways) and some metaphors strain clarity ("air thickening into a syrup of sound").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The covenant of rust and philosophy-through-craft framework offers fresh angle on repair-as-redemption. The stone fragment that "wilts near dishonesty" provides specific magical logic beyond generic truth-detection. While the grieving widow seeking repair trends toward familiar territory, the execution through resonance chamber mechanics and "tethering" process adds distinctive texture.</comment>
