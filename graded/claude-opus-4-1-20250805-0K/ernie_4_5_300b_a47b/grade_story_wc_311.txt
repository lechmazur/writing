<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his failure with Lira, driving him to name nameless fears. His internal conflict between past failure and present purpose creates genuine tension, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (using the prism, speaking aloud) that reveal his values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias transforming the monsters from anonymous threats into named entities with "the ache of knowing." The accumulative/textural lens holds as whispers layer into voices and light refracts into revelation. Cost is legible in the weight of the page and Elias's transformed heartbeat, though the mechanics of the naming process could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices through its forgotten archives and specific tools (prism, atlas, recordings). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—dust, rust, amber light, temperature drop—all serving the atmosphere of forgotten knowledge awakening. The setting actively participates in the resolution through the prism's light manipulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to confrontation with the void's monsters as whispers become voices and resist naming. The prism's light flaring and monsters solidifying creates meaningful tightening. Cost appears in the "ache of knowing" and newfound weight, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily after the resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of giving "shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless." The echo of sacrifice transforms from loss to active creation of meaning. The final image of Elias walking into night with the weighted page offers a non-literal answer about fear and connection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled syntax and selective perception (focusing on decay, light, mechanical details). The italicized echoes and questions create effective texture. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("amber light of dusk," "distant intimacy") but generally serve the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts during the ritual sequence. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor issues include some elevated diction ("iridescent," "coalesced") and occasional redundancy in describing the echoes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of a reaper seeking to name fears through refracted light and ancient recordings offers a fresh angle on grief and purpose. The synthesis of supernatural (reaper), scientific (prism/light), and archival (recordings) elements creates originality. The specific detail of wax cylinders and the observatory setting avoids generic fantasy tropes.</comment>
