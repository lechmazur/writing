Looking at this story through a demanding editorial lens for immediate publishability:

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages as Kael's modifications lead to memory entanglement and transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss ("project he'd poured years into collapsed"), with concrete embodied details like "hands trembled" and "gritted his teeth." The transformation from failed engineer to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is earned through specific struggle, though the final emotional state could use more embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change - Kael successfully transforms the mirror and himself through memory entanglement, with visible cost in the bleeding of painful memories ("faces of his disillusioned team, the taste of defeat"). Causal linkage is strong throughout, though the mechanism of "synaptic plasticity" applied to glass strains credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting functions as more than backdrop - the canyon "breathes" with shifting symbols, its walls "pressing in" during crisis. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("silver light pooling in cracks like liquid mercury"). The environment actively constrains and shapes Kael's work, with the canyon holding memories that become central to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical challenge to psychological risk as "the headband's feedback loop threatened to overwhelm him." The dominant stake - transforming failure into archaeological discovery - tightens when his own painful memories threaten the process. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of fractured glass as "pathways" for memory, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of rewiring reality through "synaptic plasticity" serves as both literal method and thematic exploration of transformation. The ending offers a resonant answer about reconstructing identity from fragments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to the "helix-minded engineer" POV. Perceptual signature is distinct ("fractal patterns," "chaotically precise"). Some filter verbs ("he realized," "seemed to") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("liquid mercury," "shattered constellations") and some template cadence in the middle section ("He lifted...He'd spent...He pressed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of neuroscience concepts with mystical canyon memories offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. "Synaptic plasticity" applied to physical objects is conceptually bold, though execution occasionally relies on familiar imagery. The specific synthesis of failed engineer becoming "archeologist of abandoned dreams" feels earned.</comment>
