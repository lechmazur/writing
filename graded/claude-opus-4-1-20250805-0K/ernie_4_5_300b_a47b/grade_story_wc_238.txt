I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages as Clara investigates, discovers the truth about the sister, and helps Elias reconnect through the perfume bottle's conductive properties.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation as "gossip-column exorcist" who deals in "half-truths and whispered scandals" is clear and distinctive. Elias's guilt-driven need to reconnect with his dead sister provides emotional weight. However, Clara's quick acceptance of the supernatural reconnection lacks internal conflict, and her transition from skeptic to believer feels unmotivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Elias's reconnection with Lila's resonance, completing the unfinished song. The causal chain from perfume bottle to induced current to musical reconnection holds logically within the story's magical realism. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract - we see the chainsaws start but don't feel what Elias sacrifices or how he's changed beyond resolution of guilt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sheet music archive setting directly enables the story - it's where Lila died, where the piano exists, and where memories resonate. Sensory details like "dust smelled of regret" and the "hush before the orchard's trees were cut down" create atmosphere. The orchard's imminent destruction adds temporal pressure that forces action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake - reconnecting with the dead sister - is clear from Elias's introduction. Pressure builds through Clara's investigation and the revelation about induced currents. However, escalation feels mechanical rather than emotionally charged; the reconnection happens too easily once Clara explains the method, lacking meaningful resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" emerges organically through Clara's unconventional exorcism methods and the incomplete resolution - Lila remains a "resonance" rather than fully restored. The final image of finishing the song "imperfectly" resonates without stating a moral. The perfume bottle as conduit and music as vibration create layered meaning about connection across death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clara's voice as a cynical professional who thinks in metaphors ("regret was her currency") is distinctive. The narrative maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Lila's accusatory "You left me here in the silence."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "gossip-column exorcist" and "the archive's dust smelled of regret." Some overwriting appears ("the hush before the orchard's trees were cut down, a silence so thick it seemed to vibrate"). Minor redundancy in explaining the copper-electricity-music connection weakens momentum in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" is genuinely fresh, combining supernatural and mundane journalism. The concept of reconnecting rather than exorcising, using perfume bottle conductivity and musical vibration, shows creative synthesis. The piece commits to its magical realism premise without retreat into pure metaphor.</comment>
