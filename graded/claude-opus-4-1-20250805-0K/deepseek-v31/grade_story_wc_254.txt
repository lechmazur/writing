<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from external translator to embodied conduit demonstrates clear internal conflict and earned change through concrete sensory experience. The "tremor of certainty" and physical fusion with the Colonnade create embodied emotional states rather than abstractions. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "aesthetically driven" trait and the final paragraph's drift toward philosophical summary ("vast, beautiful truth of connection").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara dissolves the boundary between artist and art, creating visible light-poems before accepting impermanence. The cost is legible: abandoning traditional poetry for ephemeral fusion. Orientation anchors (cobalt atrium, frozen lake, post-ban return) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade functions as active setting that constrains choice—its forbidden song drives both Elara's crime and redemption. Sensory hierarchy privileges vibration and resonance over visual, reflecting her poet's priorities. The atrium-as-lens transformation and frozen lake as "canvas of captured light" charge the final image with earned specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative deepening as Elara moves from approaching to touching to merging with the Colonnade's resonance. The dominant stake—finding form for the formless—tightens when she abandons "literal translation" for dissolution. Cost is visible in the ephemeral poem that "dissolves, its energy returning to the air."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of boundary dissolution rather than statement—art as fusion not description. The light-poem's deliberate impermanence offers a non-literal answer to the artist's relationship with the ineffable. Minor deduction for the final paragraph's slight drift toward explicit thematic summary about "connection."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature privileges sound/vibration ("lantern-moth hush," "soft crush," "resonant frequency") creating a synesthetic voice. Purposeful compression and lyric density serve the accumulative design. No dialogue maintains the contemplative register consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied syntax support the lyric mode. Deductions for repetitive abstract phrasing ("form for the formless," "formless," "formed") and the final paragraph's philosophical abstractions ("vast, beautiful truth," "endless, humming expanse"). Some filter-verb clustering ("she feels," "she understands") in middle sections dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of synaesthetic poetry with physical manifestation (light-poems in air) offers genuine freshness. The concept of art-as-dissolution rather than capture transforms the exile-return trope. Slight deduction for the somewhat familiar "banned artist returns" frame, though the execution elevates it.</comment>
