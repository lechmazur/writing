<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodological shift from seeking loud births to silent potential. Her internal progression from repeated failure to breakthrough feels earned through specific action rather than epiphany. The final moment of calm recognition carries genuine emotional weight without sentiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from static listening to active creation through density increase and pattern reversal. The closure—witnessing stellar birth through amplified silence—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cosmic-scale change. Cost is legible in years of failure leading to this moment, though personal stakes could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned city setting actively constrains Elara's work to lunar perigee and provides the necessary infrastructure. Sensory details like "hard, sterile light" and the dish's groaning serve the accumulating pressure. The final reframing of the city from tomb to lighthouse charges the closure image meaningfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through methodological shift from passive listening to active dampening, with the universe responding to her intervention. The reversal from seeking noise to finding silence drives genuine tension. Pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens, though the resolution lacks personal cost beyond professional validation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of finding beginnings in endings, embodied in both method and result. The hollywood star fragment as "antenna for absence" and the "reverse explosion" avoid heavy-handed symbolism. The final word "again" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters cosmic observation through technical precision: "calibrated magic," "dampening everything else." Voice maintains consistency through pressure, modulating from methodical observation to profound witness. The controlled register fits the character's expertise without slipping into jargon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines like "antenna for absence" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("serenely electric sheen") but serves the accumulative pattern. Strong syntactic variety and momentum, though "serenely electric" appears twice without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core reversal—seeking silence rather than noise to find creation—offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of technical procedure with cosmic wonder through "calibrated magic" feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in the quiet, methodical approach to stellar birth pays off (+0.3 within band).</comment>
