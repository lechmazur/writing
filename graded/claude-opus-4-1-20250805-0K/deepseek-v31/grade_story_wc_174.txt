<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from serene calligrapher to crude puppet performer is earned through specific internal conflict and embodied choices. The contradiction between her pursuit of pristine truth and Kael's demand for painful honesty acts simultaneously in scene, particularly in her physical destruction of her own work. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "half-lit epiphany" that borders on diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through density increase and pattern break, culminating in Elara's complete reversal of method that lands with visible cost (destroying her work, entering Kael's space). The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration through role inversion with clear before/after legibility. Slight deduction for the "half-lit epiphany" section that momentarily abstracts rather than embodying the realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radar dome's "curved, metallic solitude" constrains choice by providing isolation that enables both the argument and Elara's transformation. The story stick's texture ("rough texture a shock against her ink-stained, careful fingers") and the bar's smoke-thick atmosphere directly shape actions. However, the dome could be somewhat generic isolation; more specific properties would strengthen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how truth should be told—escalates through Elara's recognition that "her perfect calligraphy could be ignored; his ragged puppets could not." The cost is legible when she destroys her manuscripts and enters Kael's territory. The tightening occurs through her realization forcing a complete methodological reversal with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete conflict between beautiful versus ugly truth-telling, avoiding direct moralizing. The final puppet show offers a non-literal answer by enacting rather than explaining reconciliation. The recurring motif of the story stick transforms from collaboration tool to puppet body, constraining choice and charging the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's attention to texture, precision, and silence ("meteor hush," "ink as black as the void"). Voice maintains consistency even under pressure, though some phrases like "half-lit epiphany" and "highest ethical act" drift toward academic register. No dialogue to evaluate per policy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "half-lit epiphany began to dawn" mixes metaphors and some abstract passages ("highest ethical act wasn't to tell a story cleanly") reduce momentum. Information density is strong in action sequences. Minor scaffold in the philosophical middle section where adjacent sentences circle the same realization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reversal of artistic method—calligrapher becomes puppeteer—offers genuine surprise that feels earned through prior setup. The synthesis of beauty and ugliness through destroyed manuscripts becoming puppet materials is specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in having Elara completely abandon her practiced art form heightens stakes.</comment>
