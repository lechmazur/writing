Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered observations toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aris transforms from mourner to cartographer.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("fingers brushed," "breath caught") and clear motivation arc from survival to discovery. The transformation from "blessed pariah" to "cartographer of deep time" is earned through accumulated detail, though the epiphany moment could use more internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris shifts from passive mourner to active explorer, with visible cost (his isolation becomes his instrument). The accumulative structure builds density through repeated imagery (silence, light, compass) that reweights at closure when isolation transforms into unique capability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time dilation deck and "crystalline exile" establish atmosphere effectively, with sensory detail ("cool glass," "frail sun"). The nebula discovery constrains and enables the final choice, though more specific physical detail of the ship's deadness early on would strengthen the setting's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from survival to purpose as the temporal stretch transforms from curse to "unique instrument." The discovery moment creates genuine escalation under the accumulative lens, with cost visible in accepting permanent exile as the price of discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the compass rose's transformation from relic to promise, and isolation becoming capability. The ending offers a non-literal answer about finding purpose in exile without stating a moral, though "blessed pariah had found his congregation" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with effective perceptual signature ("sluggish sea," "pulled like taffy"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("gossamer light," "undiluted exploration") slightly exceeds the established register but maintains overall coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("profound quiet so complete it rang," "magnificent second"). The repetition of "echoed silence" and variations of "blessed pariah" serve the accumulative structure rather than creating loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on isolation through time dilation creating unique perception capabilities. The transformation of curse into instrument through specific detail (seeing patterns invisible to normal time) offers genuine originality, though the space isolation frame is familiar.</comment>
