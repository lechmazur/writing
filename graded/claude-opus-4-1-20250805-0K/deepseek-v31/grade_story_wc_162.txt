I'll evaluate this story systematically under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like her hand on "solidified air" and her methodical grain-reading, creating genuine interiority. The final choice to step through the threshold carries earned weight from her father's teachings. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("featherly determined") that doesn't fully land in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding transforms the Terrace from maze to "map of consequence," with visible cost in confronting her father's trauma. The accumulative structure coheres as grain patterns reveal the flight's significance, though the Chinese character "潜在" creates a brief orientation hiccup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Terrace functions brilliantly as both setting and metaphor—"floors and walls made of light and impossible angles" that shift with "celestial clock." The grain in the desk becomes crucial micro-setting that constrains and enables the key discovery, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from navigating shifting corridors to reading wood grain to stepping into traumatic memory. The sacred threshold concept deepens from architectural to temporal, with clear cost in crossing. Stakes cohere around understanding rather than action, appropriate for the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "necessary distances" concept, which transforms from architectural principle to existential truth about consequence and connection. The butterfly image resonates without heavy-handedness, and the final understanding—"the space between them"—reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical precision ("fractured hush," "wisp of a girl") that maintains consistency. The perceptual signature—focusing on texture, light, angles—fits the architect's daughter. Some elevated diction ("featherly determined") occasionally strains the POV's naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silence that was less an absence of sound and more a blanket of stopped time"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("god's fist") and the unexplained Chinese character disrupts flow. Information density high but occasionally tips into purple territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of butterfly effect with architectural memory creates genuine originality. The wood grain as weather code and the Terrace as temporal map show inventive thinking. Transformation of familiar chaos theory into intimate father-daughter story avoids cliché.</comment>
