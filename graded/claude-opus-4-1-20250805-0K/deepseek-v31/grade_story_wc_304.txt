I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This operates as an **Accumulative/Textural** piece, building density through ritual detail and metaphysical imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara captures the geomancer's essence in the emerald chip.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete ritual actions. The crossing of the "threshold of stillness" shows contradictory impulses (preserving life's spark vs accepting death) acting simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for the geomancer being purely passive, though this serves the mortician-as-artist premise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the emerald chip's transformation crystallizes the captured essence with visible cost (Elara's breath/heart stopping). The accumulative lens holds consistently through ritual buildup to the final "keeper of last lights" image that reweights the opening premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto setting directly enables the ritual through aurora light refracting in the emerald's fractures. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the "radiant hush" and light's "soft crackle" create atmosphere while the chip's warmth marks transformation. Setting constrains the ritual to this specific celestial space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the ritual's progression from physical preparation to metaphysical boundary-crossing, with Elara risking stasis ("breathing halting, heart pausing"). The emerald's warming provides tactile proof of success. Slight deduction as the conflict lacks external pressure—purely internal/spiritual stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox of finding life patterns in death's static. The final image of Elara as "keeper of last lights in the vast, dark sky" offers a non-literal answer about preservation versus oblivion. The emerald chip becomes a concrete vessel for abstract essence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through specialized mortician-artist consciousness ("finding patterns in static"). Voice maintains lyric elevation appropriate to the ritual context. Strong control of psychic distance, pulling close during the threshold crossing then expanding to cosmic scope at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"crystalline rock that floated silently amidst the clouds" establishes both setting and tone. Some elevated diction ("radiant grace," "metaphysical boundary") fits the ritual context but occasionally edges toward purple. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The beautician-for-the-dead concept offers a fresh angle on mortality, treating death preparation as art rather than preservation. The specific synthesis of geomancer/stone memory with aurora setting feels earned. Slight deduction for recognizable death-ritual template despite unique execution.</comment>
