<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal transformation from rigid anger to complex grief is earned through concrete discovery, with contradictory impulses ("cold calculation" vs. emerging understanding) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to perform as "grieving daughter" with new understanding carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("deathly vitality," "liquefied her anger") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the passport discovery reweights every prior memory with visible emotional cost ("heavier, more complex grief"). The "fair trade" motif transforms from seeking retribution to understanding sacrifice. Minor orientation delay (father's identity as con artist emerges gradually) serves the revelation structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mortuary setting and ink pot constrain choice and charge the final image—the "stainless-steel trolley" and "sterile, sacred space" create pressure for Elara's transgressive reach. Sensory detail ("cloying scent of disinfectant and wilting lilies") is selective and purposeful. The ink pot's transformation from tool of deception to vessel of truth exemplifies environment shaping meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from waiting for father → reaching for forbidden object → discovering hidden compartment → confronting asylum truth. The dominant stake (finding "mathematics of a fair trade") tightens as each revelation narrows Elara's options for simple anger. Cost is legible in the "heavier, more complex grief" that replaces her certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ink pot's dual nature—deception concealing deeper truth. The final realization that "his honesty was the asylum he built for her" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "fair trade" transforms from transaction to sacrifice, reweighting all prior material through concrete discovery rather than abstract insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's mathematical/transactional lens ("cold and constant calculation," "mathematics of a fair trade") that shapes how she processes grief. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity—clinical precision gives way to "liquefied" thinking. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("deathly vitality") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story functions. Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("liquefied her anger," "ocean of unspoken sacrifice") and occasional abstract phrasing ("deathly vitality that hummed"). The repeated "deathly vitality" bookend feels forced rather than organic. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the con artist trope—the deception conceals political asylum rather than criminal activity, transforming the entire premise. The specific detail of forged documents as survival tactics rather than scams offers genuine surprise that feels inevitable in hindsight. The "honest child of a con artist" setup pays off through role reversal where dishonesty becomes protection.</comment>
