<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's transformation from cold academic cataloguer to empathetic participant lands with genuine cost through concrete action (throwing the arrowhead). Her internal conflict between researcher duty and human connection plays out through embodied choices, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("fierce, empathetic need").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural structure builds from static confessions through gravitational play to the final unified note, with the arrowhead's transformation marking decisive change. The closure lands with visible cost—the Changed's bitterness transforms to laughter as Aris sacrifices her tool of division. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gravitationally playful garden constrains and enables key choices—the arrowhead doesn't fall but orbits, water spirals upward, spores dance. This altered physics directly shapes the closure when the arrowhead transforms from weapon to node, making the environment indispensable to the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from documenting trauma to liberation through understanding, with Aris's thrown arrowhead foreclosing her researcher path. The gravity's "playful mood" responding to intention creates coherent pressure that forces her stance crystallization, though the resolution's cosmic laughter arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The division/connection theme emerges organically through the arrowhead's transformation from "tool of hunting and division" to orbital node. The final unified note that holds "warmth of life and the cold of infinite space" offers resonant synthesis without stating a moral, reweighting all prior separation imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct academic voice modulates effectively through transformation, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("terrible and beautiful integration"). Elara's dialogue carries appropriate mystical weight. The POV maintains consistency despite conceptual complexity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("inverted rain," "dark star in a microcosm") but occasional overwriting ("gravitationally playful energy," "terrible and beautiful integration"). Some abstract phrasing in peak beats ("fierce, empathetic need") dulls immediacy. Information density remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gravitational garden as conscious space responding to intention offers fresh angle on transformation narrative. The Changed as "folded" beings who "saw the seams of reality" provides specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking with the physics-mood connection heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
