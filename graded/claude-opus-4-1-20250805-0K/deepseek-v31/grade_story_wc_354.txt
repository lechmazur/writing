I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This operates as a **Causal** story - Kael's method of counter-frequency humming causes the cartographer's breakthrough, which causes his return to awareness. The "because/therefore" linkage is clear throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is layered and consistent - finding beauty in difficulty after exile for moral stubbornness. The cartographer's silence/tapping creates genuine mystery. Minor deduction for the sister being functional but not fully realized as pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Decisive Change - the cartographer returns to awareness through Kael's intervention, with cost visible in "terrible, beautiful truth." Causal lens holds throughout. Deduction for the somewhat abstract final line about "healing the board" diluting the concrete resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Nexus functions as active setting - its magnetic resonance enables Kael's counter-frequency solution. Vivid sensory detail ("chime of magnetized spires," "metal filings in his old coat seams stir"). The worry stone's thumb-dent carries character history effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Kael's exile/ritual to the cartographer's crisis, with the Nexus phase creating time pressure. The tightening occurs when Kael must find the "lost frequency" before the phase locks. Cost is somewhat abstract ("terrible, beautiful truth") rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty/meaning in difficulty emerges through action - Kael's method literally translates silence into communication. The game metaphor threads throughout without becoming heavy-handed. Final image of "healing the board" resonates but edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature - Kael notices in strategic terms ("player in a larger game," "piece in peril"). Dialogue carries subtext well ("They say you understand the silence here"). Minor convergence in register during the resolution dampens distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density high in opening. Some elevated diction in closure ("terrible, beautiful truth," "beauty was the move that healed the board") creates mild register drift from established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The counter-frequency humming as healing method is inventive. The concept of cartographer hearing something instruments couldn't record adds freshness. However, the exile-finds-redemption arc and wise-mentor role are familiar templates not fully transformed.</comment>
