Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate it under the **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens, as the piece builds through layered details about Eli's prophetic gift, culminating in Lena's transformation through accumulated symbolic pressure rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and his twenty-year history of accidental prophecy creates genuine character depth. The internal consistency holds well, though Lena remains somewhat thin as a vessel for transformation rather than a fully realized character. The final choice to row toward the lighthouse feels slightly undermotivated from her POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with Lena rowing toward "that new, uncertain, and beautiful key" - a clear before/after with emotional cost visible in her determination. The accumulative structure coheres well through fortune-writing, signal-sending, and Lena's response. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of all elements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric work with the flour-dusted room, soy/sesame aromas, and the lighthouse beam cutting through mist. The microdot projector and modified equipment constrain Eli's method effectively. The setting actively shapes choices, particularly the lighthouse as both signal and destination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake - Lena's transformation from "debt and duty" - develops through Eli's orchestration and her response to the lighthouse signal. The escalation from fortune to signal to action works, though the middle lacks tension since Eli's plan unfolds without meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conductor metaphor ("not a puppet master pulling strings; he was a conductor") resonates throughout, with the musical language ("transpose her life into a new key," "hopeful note") creating thematic coherence. The theme of guided agency versus control emerges organically from the action without didactic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled literary register appropriate to the contemplative tone. Strong perceptual signature in Eli's observations. Minor weakness in Lena's limited dialogue and interiority, which doesn't fully distinguish her voice from the narrator's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and strong imagery. Some overwrought moments ("the familiar enigma of his own existence settling around him once more") and occasional redundancy ("new, uncertain, and beautiful"). The musical metaphors occasionally strain but mostly land effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fortune cookie writer with actual prophetic power offers a fresh angle on fate/free will. The spycraft elements feel slightly grafted rather than organic. The musical transposition metaphor throughout adds originality, though the setup relies on some convenient alignments.</comment>
