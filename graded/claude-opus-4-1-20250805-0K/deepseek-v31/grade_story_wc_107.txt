<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to craft safe zones for inquiry after participating in past failures creates genuine internal conflict. Her abandonment of the bookmark represents earned renunciation with visible cost. The dramatic narration habit reveals character under no external pressure, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("contemplative soul," "weighty lightness").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the drip-drip-drip rhythm and glass-crafting accumulate toward Elara's abandonment of guilt, with the bookmark as tangible cost. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she renounces her past tie with "weighty lightness," foreclosing return. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Elara, abandoned control room, during thaw).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The melting ice constrains time and creates urgency for Elara's work. Glass spheres function as micro-setting that enables her choice to build rather than dissect. The control room's decay mirrors internal thaw, though some descriptions lean generic ("vast, cavernous space").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the ice's groaning/shattering and Elara's glass-blowing rhythm toward her choice to abandon the bookmark. The cost is legible—leaving behind her collective's token to create new safe zones. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The thawing metaphor operates literally (melting ice) and emotionally (Elara's unburdening) without heavy-handed moralizing. Glass spheres as "tiny control rooms for the mind" offer a non-literal answer to safe inquiry. The final chorus image reweights the dripping from dirge to beginning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's dramatic narration habit ("The artisan breathes life into the formless void") distinguishes her voice and reveals character. Some register drift occurs ("赋予 weight" appears unexplained; "thoughtfully spirited" feels workshopped). Perceptual signature shows in how she hears drips as symphony notes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and the drip-drip-drip rhythm. Some template phrasing appears ("thick with ghosts," "vast, cavernous space") and abstract descriptors ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully attuned"). The unexplained Chinese character "赋予" disrupts clarity without purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-philosopher creating literal safe zones for dangerous thoughts offers a fresh angle. The dramatic self-narration while alone adds specificity. However, the thawing/frozen world metaphor for emotional states is well-worn territory, and some phrases echo workshop templates.</comment>
