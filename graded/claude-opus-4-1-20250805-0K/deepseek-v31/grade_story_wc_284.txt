I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elias's search for purpose to discovering the woman's message to his decision to vouchsafe her warning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously (phantom ache vs. need for purpose, risk vs. duty). The final choice to vouchsafe is well-earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for "fool's errand" being slightly abstract and the woman's immediate trust feeling convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost - Elias risks imprisonment to authenticate the warning. The causal chain from observation to interpretation to decision is tight. "Where unused courage waits was not a place, but a choice" crystallizes the transformation effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff and mist constrain observation initially, the snow enables the message's existence. Strong sensory work with "silver hush," "mist coiling like tame serpents." The meadow's scale ("spanning an acre") matters for the message's ambition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: personal search → discovery of urgent message → risk of imprisonment to prevent catastrophe. The tightening from abstract courage-seeking to concrete life-risking choice lands with clear cost. One meaningful turn sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action - courage found in choosing risk over safety. The pillbox's "What Remains" inscription gains resonance when Elias uses it to record the cipher. No explicit moralizing; the final image reweights his quest effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled register ("silver hush," "waxy, sculpted testament"). Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "prudently daring") fits the spy genre. Minor deduction for "breathtaking, insane gamble" feeling slightly overwrought and dialogue being functional rather than distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density high in opening. Deductions for "breathtaking, insane gamble" (register spike), "fragile thing" (cliché), and some filter constructions ("He saw not a fool's errand"). The "Give me the particulars" line effectively propels toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on spy fiction - the burned agent finding purpose through another's desperation. The snow-writing cipher is inventive. Using face powder to record intelligence shows ingenuity. Transformation of the courage quest from abstract to concrete choice elevates beyond template.</comment>
