I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a **Causal** story - Elias's quest follows clear because/therefore linkages from childhood memory loss to recovery through deliberate investigation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is crystalline and drives every choice, from seeking the greenhouse to following the celestial map. The memory recovery reversal feels earned through established childhood connection. Minor deduction for the grandfather's characterization shifting too conveniently from "recluse" to "vibrant" without adequate groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from lost memory to recovery, with the celestial map discovery providing meaningful escalation. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing - the fairy ring as guardian rather than thief - with clear emotional cost in decades of misunderstanding. The revelation reweights the entire premise effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse is vividly rendered and constrains action through water depth and structural decay. The celestial map formed by glass panels and water is inventive. Slight deduction for the underwater fairy ring's biological implausibility straining credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical search through frustration to the celestial discovery that changes tactics. The cost - decades of misplaced grief - is palpable. However, the resolution lacks active opposition; Elias faces environmental challenges but no true antagonistic force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory as preservation rather than theft emerges organically through the concrete discovery. The guardian/thief reversal reframes the entire narrative. Minor deduction for the grandfather's slightly too-neat thematic articulation in the recovered memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with selective attention to decay and marine intrusion. "Studying broken constellations" is particularly effective. Some register elevation in peak moments ("chronic curiosity," "ethereal white") slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "blackened skeletons of three merchant vessels." However, "the crisp nostalgia of that half-remembered feeling" is overwrought, and there's slight redundancy in describing the underwater environment. The "quite literally" aside breaks momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The celestial map discovery and memory-as-preservation concept show genuine ingenuity. The underwater fairy ring surviving in a drowned greenhouse is memorably specific. Slightly formulaic quest structure prevents higher scoring.</comment>
