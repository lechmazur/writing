<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's desperation to reawaken beauty drives consistent action from violin playing through the climactic soul-scream, with the locust shell touchstone revealing decades of hidden longing. The final transformation from passive musician to active catalyst feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some interior states remain more declared than embodied ("Panic was a cold spike").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: music triggers statues → flight to Warden → desperate act with shell → transformation. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (the destroyed clockwork heart, Kael's soul-scream) as the city transforms from sterile function to "verdant energy." Minor orientation wobble with "twin suns" appearing late without prior grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mechanical city versus enchanted orchard dichotomy creates immediate pressure, with brass automata and surveillance statues constraining Kael's actions. The heart-tree's sealed stump becomes the pivotal location where transformation occurs, and sensory details shift effectively from "sterile air" to "damp earth and blossom."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds cleanly: tolerated performance → statue surveillance → chase → confrontation → transformation. The cost manifests in Kael's soul-scream and the Warden's self-destruction of its clockwork heart, with agency driving each turn under causal logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The locust shell as transformation symbol pays off when it triggers the final change, and the theme of breaking free from confining forms emerges through action rather than statement. The ending reweights the opening's "liminal space" as a site of genuine transformation, though some thematic elements feel slightly mechanical (statues all turning "in perfect, chilling unison").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with phrases like "hollow, mechanical heart" and "resonantly soft," maintaining consistent POV throughout. Some register elevation in peak moments ("tectonic plates," "verdant energy") slightly strains the established voice, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("He understood then").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices ("burst," "slammed"). However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("Nothing happened," "There was no time"), and some metaphors feel slightly overworked ("monument to cold function," "sea of polished steel").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of music as magical trigger that statues recognize but machines cannot parse offers fresh specificity. The transformation from surveillance statues to living wood/moss beneath stone skin provides an unexpected reversal that feels earned through the established world logic.</comment>
