I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through density of mechanical imagery, culminating in a pattern break (the song) that reweights Kaelen's world with visible emotional cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to "reawaken true beauty" drives consistent action through discovery, assembly, and creation. The contradictory impulses between hope and futility act simultaneously in the final scene ("succeeded and failed, completely and utterly"). Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("quiet obsession that had become his entire being") but the embodied emotion of tears cutting through grime and the "quaking reverie" earn strong marks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise: Kaelen stands suspended between worlds, the song playing as "a bittersweet lament for all that was lost, and all that might one day be found again." The cost is felt in his tears and the recognition of profound absence. The accumulative lens holds as mechanical descriptions build to the pattern break of organic song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The suspended palace of "woven brass and silver filigree" hanging from stalactites creates unique spatial constraints. Setting actively shapes the search (deepest library, vault assembly). However, some description remains ornamental ("mist-shrouded abyss") without constraining choices, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovery of truth → finding schematic → assembling key → discovering egg → months of failed prototypes → final connection. The cost manifests in "tears cutting clean paths" and the recognition that beauty exists only as "echo, not presence." One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of mechanical perfection versus organic beauty, crystallizing in the song that is "beautiful, but...born of profound absence." The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: art can preserve what's lost but cannot resurrect it. The egg-to-machine transformation avoids simple binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "bedraggled prince" and "quaking reverence." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("genesis of his realm," "crystalline data-slates") that doesn't fully match Kaelen's grime-covered immediacy. The perceptual signature of seeing "interlocking complexity that felt soulless" is distinctive but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("tears cutting clean paths through the grime") but suffers from abstraction loops ("profound loss and impossible hope," "succeeded and failed, completely and utterly"). Some template phrasing appears ("For a long moment," "Then, a sound emerged"). Information density is moderate; several sentences could do more work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of building a singing machine from a fossilized egg offers genuine freshness. The transformation from preservation to reanimation, resulting in beauty that emphasizes absence rather than presence, avoids predictable resolution. The specific synthesis of mechanical and organic feels earned, though some world-building remains generic ("wise architects").</comment>
