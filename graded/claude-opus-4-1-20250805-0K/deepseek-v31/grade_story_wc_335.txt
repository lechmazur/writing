I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages, with Elias's exile dependent on finding a successor, and the apprentice's discovery enabling his freedom.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's combative tenderness and backwards walking tic create a distinctive character, with his motivation clearly rooted in the need to find a worthy successor. The apprentice's progression from frustration to understanding shows earned development. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("achingly reminded") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear closure - Elias gains freedom through the apprentice discovering the key to his conditional exile. The reversal (exile as lock requiring successor) lands with visible cost. Minor orientation delay with the nature of the exile initially unclear, but this serves the eventual revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library with shard-mirrors creates atmospheric specificity, and the afternoon shadow functions as a crucial comparative tool. Setting constrains choices through isolation and the archive's unique requirements. Some sensory narrowness - primarily visual with limited other senses engaged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from disruption through teaching crisis to revelation, with the apprentice's frustration creating genuine pressure. The dominant stake (Elias's freedom through finding successor) drives all action. Cost is visible when Elias must leave his life's work behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the geometry of absence and negative space metaphor - understanding comes from analyzing what's missing. The reversible exile concept resonates without explicit moralizing. Final image of the new archivist beginning her vigil effectively reweights the opening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled formality matching the archivist's precision. POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering. Some register elevation ("melancholy angle of three o'clock") occasionally strains, and dialogue mechanics could be smoother in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some ornamental phrases ("combative tenderness," "forlorn noise") and occasional overwriting. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in movement descriptions (backwards walking mentioned multiple times without variation).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archive and tea leaf geometry create fresh angles on mentorship and knowledge transmission. The backwards walking as nervous tic tied to reversibility adds specificity. Concept of analyzing absence rather than presence offers genuine insight, though some elements feel slightly constructed.</comment>
