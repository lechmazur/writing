I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory detail and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara proves her theory through demonstration rather than argument.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her specialized perception of walks, creating a distinct character lens. The internal drive to prove "whispers travel farther than shouts" propels consistent action. Minor deduction for the Port Master's somewhat convenient appearance and instant understanding, which slightly undercuts earned causality at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the Port Master's realization validates Elara's theory without words, with visible cost in her unsanctioned risk. The accumulative structure builds coherently through sensory navigation. Deduction for the antique key subplot which introduces but doesn't fully resolve its symbolic weight, creating slight structural looseness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains navigation and creates the test conditions, with vivid sensory detail ("grid of rust and rain," acoustic bending, puddles that never drain). The geomagnetic storm provides essential isolation. Strong integration of setting-as-character through Elara's intimate knowledge of the maze's physical quirks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating navigation challenges and the risk of Elara's unsanctioned experiment. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as sensory details intensify toward the whispered proof. Slight deduction for the relatively low personal cost - while professional risk exists, the emotional stakes could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between noise and signal, with the whisper/shout dichotomy earning its resonance through dramatized proof. The zodiac coin and antique key create symbolic texture without overstatement. Minor deduction for the slightly too-neat resolution where understanding arrives instantly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Elara's unique ability to read walks creates distinct voice texture. The prose modulates effectively with scene pressure, particularly in navigation sequences. Slight register elevation in places ("scripture," "calculated spontaneity") that occasionally tensions against the industrial setting's grounded voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high, particularly in setting description. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("frenetic hues," "calculated spontaneity") and slight template cadence in the middle navigation sequence ("She heard... She heard...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of navigation through embodied knowledge rather than technology offers fresh perspective on familiar lost-in-storm territory. Elara's walk-reading ability provides original texture. However, the setup (storm disables technology, protagonist uses analog methods) follows recognizable patterns, limiting higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
