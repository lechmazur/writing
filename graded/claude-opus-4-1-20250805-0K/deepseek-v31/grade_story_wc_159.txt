I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through density of imagery and pattern, with the final act of breathing light into the orchid serving as a cadence shift that reweights the preservation theme.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aeliana's motivation is crystalline and her internal conflict between preservation duty and foxglove regret creates genuine tension. The moment she breathes the mist and transforms it to light shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("quiet dread") rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Aeliana transforms from passive keeper to active rekindler, with visible cost (the silver light fading from her). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through the crack→search→transformation sequence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal library and glass orchids create a vivid, constraining environment where every detail matters - the crack in bamboo, the crystallized emotions on shelves, the silver mist. The micro-setting of the bamboo tube directly constrains choice and charges the final image of rekindled light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural intensification: crack discovered→widening fracture→dulling petals→breathing mist→transforming to light. The cost is unmistakable when "silver light fading from her" shows physical depletion. One meaningful deepening that changes both tactics and knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus renewal emerges organically through concrete action, never stated. The final image of Aeliana as "keeper of echoes" who will "continue to light the way" offers a resonant answer about active renewal over passive preservation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Aeliana notices the library's "milk-white stone" and "crystallized joy." Voice maintains lyrical control through pressure, though some moments edge toward elevated register ("sublime, aching beauty"). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and information density. Deduction for register drift into elevated diction ("sublime, aching beauty," "deserted marvel") and one instance of emotional labeling ("quiet dread settled"). The transformation sequence achieves excellent propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass orchids sustained by memory and a library of extinct emotions creates a genuinely fresh world. The specific solution of breathing emotion-mist to create light that heals is non-obvious yet feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
