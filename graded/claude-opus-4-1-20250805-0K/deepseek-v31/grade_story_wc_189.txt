I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The narrative builds through layered perception and a vision sequence that reweights understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Ayla's expanded temporal perception transforms her relationship with Kael.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ayla's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority ("feel its weave in the life and death") and embodied observation. The vision sequence earns its epiphany through the jade cicada's discovery and her tangential thinking method. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional resolution, though the cost of understanding Kael's fear is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the jade cicada bridges past and present, with visible emotional cost in Kael's "anger visibly softened into recognition, then wistfulness." The accumulative lens holds throughout, building texture through tidal pools, time's weave, and the vision. Orientation anchors established within 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively shapes the narrative through tidal pools that mirror time's texture, and the jade cicada discovery emerges naturally from the environment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("starlight fractured on the water's surface"). The setting constrains choice by providing the reflective space needed for Ayla's vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture to bridge generational conflict—deepens through the vision sequence that transforms abstract disagreement into embodied understanding. Cost is visible in Kael's vulnerability ("I thought I'd lost it") and Ayla's recognition of his fear. The tangential approach creates organic escalation rather than forced confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the cicada metaphor of transition periods without explicit moralizing. The final image of finding "a new, softer path forward" resonates with the molting metaphor while avoiding tidy resolution. Subtext operates beautifully in Ayla's choice to cite Kael's old paper rather than explain her vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization through Ayla. Strong perceptual signature in how she notices time's texture in minute details. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext ("It was waiting"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation during the vision that doesn't fully match Ayla's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, particularly in the vision sequence. Deductions for overwriting in places ("cathedral of the sea," "pinwheeled in a slow, majestic dance") and some figurative density during high-pressure beats without full payoff. Several instances of elevated diction strain the voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine biology observation with temporal philosophy creates an original angle. The tangential thinking method and jade cicada as temporal bridge show genuine ingenuity. The generational conflict through scientific methodology disagreement avoids cliché. Risk-taking in the vision sequence pays off through specific imagery.</comment>
