<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's chronological homesickness and need to reclaim lost childhood creates compelling internal contradiction, embodied through physical exhaustion against spiritual yearning. The final choice to conduct the symphony rather than physically return shows earned renunciation with visible cost ("exhaustion hit, a wave of leaden cold that buckled her knees"). Minor deduction for "cryptic fortune cookie writer" feeling more like prompt-fulfillment than organic characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through memory-mapping to symphony crescendo, landing with Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara transforms homesickness from "wound" to "melody." Cost is viscerally felt through physical collapse and acceptance that "that door was closed." The nautilus shell's spiral geometry elegantly links natural time to memory's exponential expansion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Glass Spire functions as active constraint—its "vertiginous chamber" and central dais shape Elara's ritual, while the frozen lake's "upturned hush" creates necessary isolation for the symphony. The mirrored horizon within the Spire's walls becomes the crucial space where memory crystallizes. Environment directly enables and constrains the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal yearning through active memory-mapping to the symphony's crescendo, with exhaustion as ticking clock ("had to act before exhaustion hits"). The cost manifests physically as Elara collapses, having spent everything to transform her homesickness. One meaningful deepening through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the nautilus spiral's embodiment of natural time versus human memory, with the inverted world showing what cannot be reclaimed. The final transformation—homesickness becoming melody rather than wound—offers resonant answer without stating moral. The "cryptic fortune" metaphor lands as self-fulfilling prophecy through music rather than time travel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic rendering ("conducting unheard symphonies"), with controlled modulation from contemplative opening to urgent conducting to exhausted acceptance. Minor register elevation in places ("cathedral of silence and refracted starlight") but maintains coherence. The POV's musical-temporal perception stays consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the memory-mapping sequence. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("vertiginous chamber," "fossilized labyrinth") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor template cadence in "She conducted...She began to map" sequence. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths matching emotional rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of musical conducting with temporal homesickness offers fresh angle on memory/loss themes. The inverted world as perfect but unreachable memory shows originality. Risk-taking in the abstract concept pays off through concrete embodiment, though "cryptic fortune cookie writer" feels template-derived rather than organic.</comment>
