<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aelia's motivation is crystalline and her love for the settlers drives every action, with the final manifestation paying off her ghostly constraint with visible cost. The piece earns its closure through accumulated acts of care, though internal contradiction could be sharper in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught chalk messages building to the nebula revelation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is felt in Aelia's draining effort and the settlers' transformed understanding, making the before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches creates distinctive atmosphere, and the bell becomes a crucial conduit constraining Aelia's agency. Setting pressures choices through the blight's advance and the nebula's hidden presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulating messages, growing settler doubt, then the map leading to revelation—each step narrowing options. The cost of Aelia's nightly manifestations and the settlers' faith-testing labor is palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of collective action emerging from trust develops organically through the bell's "trustworthy tone" and culminates in understanding partnership rather than servitude. The nebula revelation reweights all prior work without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive ethereal voice with phrases like "particulate silence" and "brambled hope" that maintain consistency. The perceptual signature of a ghost observing her beloved settlers creates poignancy, though some register elevation ("capricious spirit") slightly exceeds the intimate tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "tapestry of cultivated life" and strong rhythm variation. Minor density issues with some ornamental description ("velvety cobalt") and one instance of telling what's shown ("sensing its benevolent nature").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-guardian unable to directly communicate creates fresh tension, and the chalk messages building to cosmic revelation feels earned. The premise transforms familiar elements through specific world-building, though the resolution edges toward convenient.</comment>
