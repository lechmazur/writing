<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in witnessing coral death, driving her discovery quest. Her finger-tapping habit effectively embodies her nervous system "synced to the sea." The internal shift from "moored to loss" to recognizing "what endured" shows genuine character movement with visible emotional cost in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: discovery of atlas page → research → journey → finding living reef → reconfiguration of worldview. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's stance shifts from pure witness to loss to acknowledging persistence, with emotional cost visible in her two-rhythm tapping. The "who, where, when" anchors establish clearly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station's periodic submersion and the reef's specific hydrology (cold currents meeting warm surface) constrain the narrative and enable the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the "supple with salt damp" atlas page. The living reef's "riot of muted color" charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why some paths persist—escalates from data monitoring through active investigation to physical journey and discovery. The reef's survival against expectation provides meaningful reversal. Cost is legible in Elara's reconciliation of "witness to loss" with newfound possibility, though the physical journey itself lacks complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between disappeared paths and those that "stubbornly remain," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of dual finger-tapping rhythms—"a beat for what was lost, and a slower, deeper beat for what endured"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to persistence versus loss without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through Elara's oceanographer perspective, with controlled modulation during discovery ("quiet frenzy," "staccato beat"). The perceptual signature shows in how she processes everything through marine metaphors ("soul moored," "drifted through duties"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor redundancy appears in "periodically eternal" and some filter constructions ("she felt," "she found"), but these don't touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coral reef survival premise offers a specific angle on climate recovery narratives through the unique hydrology protection. The finger-tapping habit as embodied connection to tidal patterns shows originality. However, the "message in a bottle" discovery and journey-to-hidden-paradise arc follow familiar templates without significant transformation.</comment>
