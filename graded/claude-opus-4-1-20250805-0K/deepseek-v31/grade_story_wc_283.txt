I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through cataloging and pattern accumulation, with the final transformation arising from density of assembled possibilities rather than causal reversals.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Turnkey's motivation is clear and compelling - transforming prophecy into possibility through patient cataloging. Her internal experience is embodied through calloused hands and meditative sorting. The final choice to place the obsidian button shows earned agency, though the emotional cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the obsidian button transforms the hourglass's nature, expanding prophecy into spectrum. The accumulative lens holds as button-cataloging builds to this reconfiguration. Cost is conceptually clear (abandoning singular destiny) though emotionally understated. The piece teaches its pattern early and pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse with honeyed light sheets creates atmospheric specificity that mirrors the temporal work. Button details (pearl/priest, brass/soldier, clay/child) embody lost choices concretely. The obsidian button's coldness and perfection charge the final transformation, though mid-story spatial choreography occasionally blurs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation - each cataloged button adds to the chorus of possibilities until reaching critical mass with the obsidian piece. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases toward transformation. However, the conflict lacks immediate visceral tension; the work feels meditative rather than urgent despite the falling sands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete metaphor of buttons as unmade choices. The final image of multicolored sands replacing monochrome fate offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "The prophecy was not broken; it was expanded" crystallizes the thematic insight that destiny contains multiplicities.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic distance with selective formality ("The Keeper of the Glass lived..."). Perceptual signature shows in how she experiences buttons through "subtle resonance" and "humming." The canyon echo's "stone sighing" voice is distinctive, though dialogue mechanics are minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical precision in key moments ("dusty, honeyed sheets," "stone sighing"). Some template phrasing appears ("Days bled into one another," "deep, resonant hum") but doesn't obscure closure. Information density is generally strong though a few passages could tighten ("meditation, her hands moving with a gentle certainty").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging lost buttons as forgotten possibilities offers fresh mythic logic. The hourglass-turner role transforms from passive keeper to active possibility-weaver. While prophecy stories are familiar, the specific synthesis of buttons/choices/sand creates memorable particularity.</comment>
