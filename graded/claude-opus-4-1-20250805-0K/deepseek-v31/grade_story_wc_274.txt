I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from discovery to broadcast, with each action narrowing Elara's options.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from dutiful archivist to truth-revealer is earned through concrete internal conflict ("bravely conflicted, her sense of duty to the Vault violently at odds with a new, terrifying duty to the dead"). The moment of action "within the blink that follows surprise" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in the final paragraph rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery through broadcast to aftermath, with clear Decisive Change when Elara transmits the letter. Cost is visible in "She had lit a fuse on a monument of lies" and the transformation of the archive from "tomb" to "witness." The closure lands with felt consequence as she accepts her new role. Minor weakness: the speed of her security bypass strains credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Vault's atmosphere effectively constrains choice through "Silence was the only currency" and the frozen, isolated setting that makes her action more transgressive. Strong sensory work with "soft-soled boots making no sound on the frosted metal grates" and "the hum of stasis fields." The setting actively shapes the stakes - the very architecture of secrecy she violates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear escalation from discovery through moral crisis to irreversible action. The dominant stake (duty vs. truth) tightens when she realizes "To file this was to re-entomb it." The cost is legible in her waiting for "alarms, for the ice above her head to crack." Agency drives the climax through her deliberate choice to broadcast despite her training.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and revelation, with the letter as concrete embodiment of dangerous truth. The transformation of the archive from "tomb" to "witness" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong subtext in "She had not spoken a word, but she had screamed across time." Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract final line about "the conversation."]</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled, cold precision matching the setting ("petabytes of data on crystalline slivers"). POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual narrowing under stress. The prose modulates effectively from clinical description to urgency during the hack sequence. Minor weakness in slightly repetitive "She" openings in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("a tomb of knowledge buried deep beneath the perpetual snows"). Some filter verb accumulation ("She imagined," "She waited") in the penultimate paragraph dulls immediacy. The "dizzying quiet" motif effectively bookends the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a cryogenic archivist discovering a suppressed genocide letter offers fresh angle on whistleblower narratives. The "Harvest" euphemism and love letter format for discussing mass murder shows originality. The transformation from keeper to revealer feels earned. Slightly conventional in the basic moral calculus of truth versus order.</comment>
