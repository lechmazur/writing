<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's stubbornness transforms from resistance to sacred determination, driving the climactic repair with earned cost. The grandfather figure applies meaningful pressure through the silent exchange. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("chased stillness," "desperate need") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the broken lens accumulating meaning through descent, discovery, and repair, culminating in grandfather's dissolution into light. Closure lands with visible cost as grandfather finally finds rest. Slight dock for predictable beats in the middle section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater library with floating books and kelp-wrapped columns creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere that enables the resolution. The broken lens constrains and enables the final choice perfectly. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("flat, leaden plate").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds from receiving the lens to understanding its purpose to completing the repair, with each beat narrowing Silas's options. The cost is visible as grandfather dissolves and Silas's "chased stillness" finally resolves. Could push harder on intermediate resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of completing unfinished stories emerges organically through the lighthouse lens metaphor and the library of the dead. The final image of grandfather dissolving into welcoming light rather than warning resonates without stating a moral. Slight abstraction in "chased stillness" keeps it from higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with maritime vocabulary and undertaker's perspective on permanence. Clean POV control throughout. Some register elevation ("aqueous gloom," "kaleidoscope") slightly strains the established voice in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Deductions for abstract phrases ("chased stillness," "desperate need"), some elevated diction that doesn't match POV ("aqueous gloom"), and mild redundancy in describing the library's paradoxical nature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper and undertaker creates an underwater library of the dead—specific and memorable. The broken lens as both distress signal and solution shows ingenuity. Loses points for some familiar underwater ruin tropes.</comment>
