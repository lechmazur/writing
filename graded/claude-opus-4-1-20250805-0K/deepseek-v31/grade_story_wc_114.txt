I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is a **Causal** story - the narrative follows a clear because/therefore chain from Rhys's fever recovery through his investigation of the avalanche data, with each discovery narrowing his options and raising stakes.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("bone-deep ache," "legs unsteady") and a character whose professional identity drives meaningful investigation. The protagonist's method of "occupying margins" to understand truth creates genuine character-specific perception. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Excellent causal structure with a Decisive Change closure - Rhys discovers proof validating his impossible observation, fundamentally altering his relationship to certainty and the world's preparedness. The cost is palpable: his "certainty was gone, replaced by a terrifying freedom." Minor orientation delay (weather station context comes late) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station effectively constrains choices through its isolation and specialized equipment. Strong integration of technical details (anemometers, harmonic vibration monitors) that enable the investigation. The forget-me-not drawing serves as both physical anchor and thematic mirror. Some spatial choreography could be clearer in the workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate beautifully from personal recovery to paradigm-shifting discovery. The dominant stake - understanding whether his observation was real - tightens through concrete investigation steps. The cost manifests in "terrifying freedom" and the weight of knowing "the world below was unprepared." One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, perfectly suited to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the forget-me-not's survival strategy of "yielding, by learning its rhythms from the edges" - a perfect mirror for Rhys's investigative method. The ending offers a resonant answer about truth existing in margins without stating a moral. The "auroral sorrow" beautifully captures the lonely beauty of unwelcome knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with sophisticated vocabulary appropriate to the scientific observer. Strong perceptual signature in how Rhys notices peripheral details ("every dust mote dancing"). Some elevated diction ("auroral sorrow," "heresy") occasionally strains but remains within character. Clean POV control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("vast, snow-whipped window," "convenient physiological coup") and occasional register elevation. The "smudge" moment effectively uses physical action to mirror internal state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the unreliable narrator through fever and professional doubt. The concept of finding truth in peripheral data rather than central systems offers genuine originality. The avalanche as silent apocalypse that official systems ignore creates memorable specificity. Some familiar beats in the investigation sequence prevent higher scoring.</comment>
