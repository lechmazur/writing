I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from discovery of damaged drone through diagnosis to successful repair, with each action enabling the next.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her specialized method, and her motivation crystallizes through the engineer's desperation. The character-specific sensory processing and tactile expertise feel authentic, though internal conflict remains minimal during the repair sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from damaged drone discovery through water-based diagnosis to successful repair launch achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (time pressure of departing ship). The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph, and the because/therefore linkages hold throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The depot's fountain becomes instrumental to Elara's diagnostic method, and sensory details effectively convey her non-visual perception. The Victorian water feature and mist create atmosphere while serving plot function, though some descriptive phrases ("cavernous space," "hollow drip") trend generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly through the harbor's iron clang signaling imminent departure, forcing Elara to work under deadline pressure. The tension between the ship's need and the drone's damage creates genuine urgency that pays off when the repaired drone races to catch the vessel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of alternative perception emerges organically through Elara teaching the drone to "read the world as she did: through interpretation, not just observation." This conceptual shift from fixing to transforming resonates without explicit moralizing, and the final image of the confident ship's horn validates her approach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV maintains consistent close third with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("a chaotic, buzzing poem"). Some phrases drift toward writerly register ("magnetic calm settled," "relentless, patient grace") that slightly distance from Elara's embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the repair sequence. However, some overwriting appears ("grand but neglected Victorian water feature," "crystalline dart against the grey sky") and occasional template constructions ("She began," "She carefully carried") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The blind artisan using water refraction to diagnose optical damage offers genuine freshness, and the solution of teaching interpretation over observation transforms the expected repair narrative. The specific method and philosophical shift feel earned rather than convenient.</comment>
