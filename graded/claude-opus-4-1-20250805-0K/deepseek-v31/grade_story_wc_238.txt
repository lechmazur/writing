grade_story_wc_238.txt
I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the narrative builds through layered metaphors, sensory accumulation, and pattern intensification toward a resonant reconfiguration where Finch's ghost dissolves into the archive's atmosphere.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character specificity with Elara's unique exorcism method and complex guilt motivation. The ghost's transformation from mechanical repetition to conscious recognition earns its resolution through accumulated emotional currents. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak in "fractured your story" exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Finch dissolves into the archive with visible cost (the orchard's destruction paralleling forgiveness). The accumulative lens holds consistently through metaphorical layering and sensory density. Orientation anchors established within first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive and orchard function as active constraints - the impending destruction creates temporal pressure while the perfume bottle's "captured memory" enables contact. Setting details like "scores stacked like geological strata" integrate naturally with action and meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through induced currents that force Finch to experience "the entirety of his passion" - a deepening that changes his state from mechanical repetition to conscious awareness. Cost is visible in both the orchard's destruction and Elara's decade-long guilt, though the conflict could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard/archive parallel creates resonant thematic architecture about preservation versus transformation. "Imperfect miracles" emerges naturally through specific details rather than assertion. The final nocturne sliding from the shelf offers a non-literal answer about how art persists beyond scandal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("sheet music archive during the peculiar, weighted silence that precedes an ending"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext through metaphorical indirection. Slight register elevation in places but maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("rosin and pipe smoke") and varied sentence structures. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("painful, exquisite circuit") and occasional elevated diction ("terminal bloom") that slightly strains the register. Information density high but a few redundancies ("weary understanding" could be shown).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with journalism guilt creates an original angle. The "gossip-column exorcist" profession and method of using induced emotional currents rather than banishment shows genuine inventiveness. Risk-taking in the metaphorical dialogue exchange pays off.</comment>
