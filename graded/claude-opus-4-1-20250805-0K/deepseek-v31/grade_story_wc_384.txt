<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelin's motivation is clear and visceral—guilt over her brother's impending death from orders she transcribed. The internal contradiction between her treason and moral purpose creates genuine tension. The revelation that her forgery serves the Queen's own need adds complexity without undermining her agency. Minor deduction for the Queen's Guard appearing without earlier embodied tension that would heighten the confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear closure: Kaelin's individual act of treason transforms into sanctioned justice when Varos reveals the Queen's complicity and provides the seal. The cost is visible—her brother dying, her risk of execution—and the final image of stalactites marking "punctuation" in "forgiving twilight" creates resonant reconfiguration. The twist feels earned through Varos's shared grief (his son in the regiment). Slight deduction for the convenience of Varos tracking her without earlier tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary with aurora light and dripping stalactites creates atmospheric pressure for delicate forgery work. The heritage rose thorn as a tool specific to royal parchment adds textural authenticity. Setting constrains choice through isolation and the need for natural light. Minor weakness: the hidden compartment's seamless invisibility strains spatial credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (saving brother) to political (treasonous forgery) to revelation of state-sanctioned deception. Varos's arrival creates genuine pressure—arrest seems imminent until the reversal. The dominant stake (correcting fatal orders) tightens when Varos reveals the missing tremor detail, then transforms when he provides the seal. Cost is legible throughout: brother's life, Kaelin's risk, the Queen's political bind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "calibrated treason"—individual moral action intersecting with state necessity. The concept of "forgiving the unfinished" gains layers: Kaelin's personal amends, the Queen's indirect correction, and broader justice. The final image of stalactites as punctuation marks in "forgiving twilight" resonates without stating a moral. Strong thematic integration through action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception fitting a forger's attention to detail ("fibrous texture," "slight tremble"). Dialogue between Kaelin and Varos carries subtext effectively—his "masterful copy" both threat and acknowledgment. Minor weakness in slight register elevation during description ("cathedral of stone") that doesn't fully match Kaelin's practical mindset, though it serves atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong moments ("each heavy, resonant plink marking the passage of a moment she could not afford to waste"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("cathedral of stone," "pearl twilight") but serves atmosphere. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("quieter, more desperate need") where concrete detail would strengthen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of state-sanctioned forgery to correct political errors offers a fresh angle on typical palace intrigue. The heritage rose thorn as the only tool for royal parchment is specific and memorable. The twist—that Kaelin's treason serves the Queen's needs—reframes the premise effectively. Some familiar elements (medieval setting, royal intrigue) prevent higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
