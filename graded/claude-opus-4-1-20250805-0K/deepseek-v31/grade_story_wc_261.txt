<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aveline's internal contradiction between seeking closure and reopening wounds creates genuine complexity, with embodied pain ("throbbed with a deep, resonant pain") and the earned realization that scars are "seals" not "books." The final unwrapping shows decisive agency with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("closure seeker who only knew how to open wounds").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Conceptual Repricing: the realization that scars document healing rather than wounding, and that her miracle was "displaced" but her healing remains "hers alone, earned and honest." The cost is both felt (physical pain, shaking) and conceptual (loss of expected miracle), landing firmly on-page with the careful unwrapping as decisive action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond description: the tower's isolation mirrors Aveline's state, the ivy becomes a sensory conduit for memory, and the hourglass marks time's passage. The "meteor hush" atmosphere and clinical surgery details ground the piece, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("viscous tendrils of anesthesia").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening understanding: from reading coffee rings to accessing surgery memory through plants, to discovering the displaced miracle, finally accepting scars as healing markers. The revelation that her expected miracle went elsewhere creates genuine loss with visible cost (shaking, pain sharpening "no longer just physical").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the scar-reading metaphor: wounds versus healing, seeking versus accepting, the nature of miracles. The final insight that "The story was not in the cut, but in the knit" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior scar imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style ("She didn't walk it; she fell into it"). The perceptual signature of reading patterns in everything is consistent, and the prose modulates effectively during the surgery memory sequence, though occasional elevated diction ("susurrus of root and tendril") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective rhythm, particularly in the surgery sequence. Some overwriting appears ("viscous tendrils," "susurrus") and mild redundancy in explaining the telepathic ability, but information density remains high and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical trauma, plant telepathy, and scar-reading creates an original emotional landscape. The concept of "displaced miracles" and reading healing rather than wounding in scars transforms familiar recovery narrative tropes into something specific and memorable.</comment>
