I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** - the piece builds through layered observations of dust patterns, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aris transforms from rigid processor to "archivist of nearby renewal."

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris's transformation from emotional armor to humble connection is earned through concrete accumulation of dust observations. The contradictory impulses between her rigid preprocessing and growing fascination with microscopic beauty act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she traces "a faint smudge of gold on a surviving nasturtium leaf" while processing stellar decay.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Aris abandons her protective certainty ("Her grand narrative of tragedy decayed") and accepts vulnerability by leaving the roof open to "more dust, more potential." The accumulative lens holds as each dust discovery reweights her stance toward loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains choices throughout - its "glass fractures and water-stained soil" force methodical clearing, while the butterfly wing's discovery beneath "shattered terracotta" redirects her entire approach. The micro-setting of dust patterns becomes the primary environment that charges the final image of purposeful openness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation reads as density increase through accumulated dust discoveries that progressively narrow Aris's emotional options. The cost is legible when she acknowledges being "schooled by motes of dust" - her professional identity as mapper of "celestial beasts" yields to humble acceptance of microscopic teaching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ending offers a non-literal answer through the open roof - vulnerability replacing armor without stating the moral. The butterfly wing's nanostructured architecture that bends light "not with pigment, but with architecture" reweights all prior dust as evidence of "persistent, beautiful existence on a microscopic scale."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through scientific precision applied to grief: "strip needless drama from the loss, to reduce this personal catastrophe to a set of quantifiable variables." The prose rhythm modulates from clinical distance to wonder as she discovers "a cosmos" in the wing's scales.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "dust from a butterfly wing, and it held the secrets of a different kind of gravity" bridges scientific and emotional registers. Minor scaffold in "She saw...She began to see" but propulsion remains strong through varied syntax and precise technical language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics methodology applied to greenhouse grief feels non-obvious - using neutron star decay patterns to process flood damage. The specific detail of "microscopic ridges grating faintly against her thumbprint" and leaving the roof deliberately open shows commitment to the premise.</comment>
