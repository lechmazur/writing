<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief in the memory sequence ("salt spray, the creak of a ship's deck") and earned transformation from isolation to wholeness. The protagonist's internal contradiction between skepticism and buried trauma drives authentic change. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("necessary isolation," "life half-lived") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonance structures building to a Decisive Change where Elara integrates her suppressed memory, paying visible emotional cost. The shell discovery → Archive activation → memory recovery → acceptance follows clean causality. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final transformation that could use one more beat of embodied cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Velvet Garden's skin-like blossoms and light-drinking soil create vivid atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's state. The Archive as "stone plinth etched with spirals" provides concrete anchor for the supernatural mechanism. The shell constrains choice and charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical discovery through emotional recognition ("shudder of recognition, deep and unwelcome") to full memory recovery with brother's death. The cost is clear—accepting grief to live fully. However, the protagonist's agency is somewhat passive after placing the shell; the Archive does most of the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shell as "tragically radiant"—beautiful but broken, linking to memory that illuminates through loss. The final realization that "grief was not a prison to escape, but a sea to learn to sail" resonates without moralizing. Strong integration of isolation/independence motif throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("charmed skeptic," "ghostly resolve," "tragically radiant"). Clean psychic distance shifts during memory sequence. Some register elevation in places ("bulwark against whispers," "quarantined behind a wall") slightly exceeds the gardener POV but remains purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("necessary isolation," "life half-lived") and slight overwriting in metaphorical sections that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of garden-as-psyche with the Archive's resonance structures creating an original memory-recovery mechanism. The "tragically radiant" paradox and transformation of suppression into integration shows genuine insight. Slightly familiar trauma-recovery arc prevents higher score.</comment>
