I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through gathered resonances and sensory accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a ritual act that transforms the house.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization as a "noticer of creeping normality" manifests beautifully through specific perception and action, with her quiet obsession driving the discovery and ritual. Her choice to participate rather than merely observe shows earned agency, though internal contradiction could deepen further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Elara's consecration transforms the house from "inert" to "truly alive," with visible cost in her kneeling in damp earth and offering her own understanding. The accumulative structure coheres through gathered objects building to the orris root as keystone, teaching its pattern early through specific sensory detail.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as active participant—the orris root shard constrains choice and enables the consecration, while gathered objects (stone, saucer, feather) create the ritual's necessary conditions. The Victorian house transforms from "cold and hollow" to warm sanctuary through environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening understanding—from observation to discovery of the seeding method to active participation in consecration. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each discovered object adds weight to Elara's eventual choice, with cost visible in her physical commitment to the ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "stolen silence and gifted peace" into wholeness, avoiding direct statement. The final image of "one corner made whole" through "gentle, sacred theft" offers a resonant answer to why houses feel alive without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through Elara's selective noticing ("streetlights daydreaming," "hushed blaze"), with rhythm modulating effectively from contemplative observation to ritual intensity. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal consistency holds throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though occasional elevated diction ("consecration," "sanctified") slightly strains the intimate register. Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of houses becoming alive through "displaced objects" gathering resonances offers a fresh angle on place and belonging. The specific synthesis of ritual through found objects feels earned, though the transformation could push further into unexpected territory.</comment>
