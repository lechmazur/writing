I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's warmly inquisitive nature drives concrete discovery through the goggles examination, and her shift from "grieving subordinate" to "witness honoring a life" shows earned internal movement. The captain's posthumous characterization through diary entries effectively layers contradictory states (duty/joy). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of her role as "keeper of light" with thematic messaging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through the diary revelation reweighting Elara's understanding of service and memory. The closure lands with emotional cost ("grateful joy now a quiet warmth") and transforms her descent. Orientation anchors established early (elevator, spire, penthouse delivery). Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire and brass elevator create atmospheric pressure, with sensory details like "fingers, chilled even through her gloves" grounding the environment. The "narrow fissure...shard of sunlight" enables the crucial discovery. Deduction for underutilized spatial potential—the vertical journey could more actively constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from simple delivery to uncovering hidden meaning, with the ten-floor constraint creating natural pressure. The discovery sequence (cipher→light projection→diary decryption) builds methodically. Cost registers in Elara's transformed understanding of her service. Slight deduction for the convenient ease of the decryption process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of "anguish of his post" versus "secret treasure" of joy, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara as "keeper of light" resonates without stating its meaning. The captain's encrypted joys and Elara's role in preserving them create layered significance about witnessing and memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, particularly effective in "She read with affectionate detachment." Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices worn leather and faint patterns others might miss. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("sacred," "testament") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks marking discovery beats. Strong specificity in "brass-grated elevator" and "geometric key." Some figurative density in the final paragraph ("keeper of light," "journey forever changed") borders on overwriting but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery offers a fresh angle on posthumous communication, with the light-projection method adding specificity. The piece transforms the "message from beyond" trope through concrete detail and earned emotional weight. Doesn't quite reach higher bands due to familiar emotional territory despite solid execution.</comment>
