<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—her compulsion to prove coincidences have meaning drives every choice from touching the seed to calculating star paths. The internal contradiction between loneliness and stubborn hope plays out through embodied moments (fingers brushing metal, holding the shard). Her final understanding that the message was "a declaration that someone, somewhere, had also survived" earns the emotional arc through prior struggle, though some interior passages lean toward explanatory rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from thistle seed to beacon light through pattern accumulation—each vision deepens understanding until the final beam "pierces the darkness." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes she's sent a response signal, reweighting all prior isolation with connection's possibility. Cost is visible in "weeks" of calculation and the "crushing weight of failure" before success. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the post-collapse setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Glass Humming Pavilion functions as both setting and instrument—its crystalline panels and central plinth constrain Elara's actions and enable the final rekindling. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("stone and wind," "dust and shadows," the pavilion's deep hum "felt more than heard"). The broken prism's physical specificity matters to plot mechanics. Slight deduction for generic "blackness" and "cold points" in the climax where more specific star-path imagery could heighten.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from maintaining a dead beacon through discovering the prism to the specific challenge of finding "the one, specific path." The dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—tightens when Elara must trace an "aberrant star-path" from collapse night. Cost accumulates through "weeks" of calculation with "hope as fragile and persistent as the thistles." The moment of apparent failure ("crushing weight") before success creates earned reversal, though the resolution could show more immediate consequence beyond sending the signal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the thistle seed motif—from coincidence to "signpost" to "thistle-blown hope sewing a thread across the void." The story resists simple optimism; the beacon lights only as "a ghost of what once was." The final realization that someone else survived and was "waiting for a sign" reweights all prior loneliness without stating a moral. Minor deduction for "beautiful coincidence" which edges toward thematic declaration rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception fitting a solitary custodian ("Her world was stone and wind"). The retrocognitive visions create distinct textural shifts—especially the "shard of hush so complete it felt solid." Slight register elevation in places ("pierced the sky," "lance from the crystal shard") fits the mythic scope. Some filter constructions ("she saw," "she understood") could be more immediate, and occasional explanatory passages dilute POV immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the vision sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot, atmosphere, or meaning. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("It was a faint light, a ghost of what once was, but it was lit. It was alive") and some scaffolding phrases ("Following a compulsion," "For a long moment"). The climactic paragraph contains slight redundancy between "faint light" and "ghost of what once was."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retrocognitive gift offers fresh perspective on post-apocalyptic isolation—touch-triggered visions of "mostly loss" create specific texture. The broken prism's backstory as a "frantic, desperate attempt to focus the beacon's light" during collapse adds original detail. The concept of tracing a signal that "fled" rather than arrived inverts expectations. Some elements feel familiar (last custodian, fallen civilization) but the synthesis through coincidence-as-meaning and the thistle seed's role as cosmic messenger elevates beyond template.</comment>
