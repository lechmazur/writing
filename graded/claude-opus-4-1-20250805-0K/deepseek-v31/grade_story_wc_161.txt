<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between fleeing her past and preserving lost songs drives credible choices, particularly the final release of Argos despite her fear of exposure. The meteorite-balancing ritual embodies her psychological state through concrete action. Minor deduction for the composer revelation feeling slightly convenient, though it earns its emotional weight through specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through dust-reading, meteorite-balancing, and music discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara releases Argos, accepting risk to preserve the songs. The cost—abandoning her carefully maintained isolation—is visible when she breaks her self-imposed rule. The composer's backstory integrates smoothly as discovered artifact rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains choice through its isolation while the skylight becomes the portal for both ritual and release. Sensory details ("blooming, withering scent of old glue") filter through Elara's preservation-focused perception. The meteorite and dust motes function as micro-settings that shape her daily practice and final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulation: from static balance-seeking to discovering the music to releasing Argos despite exposure risk. The dominant stake—preserving lost songs versus maintaining safety—crystallizes when she must choose between hoarding the discovery or sending it out. Cost is legible in her breaking months of isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between preservation and release, with the meteorite's otherworldly permanence contrasting the ephemeral songs. The "Canticle for the Unreturned" transforms from absence into presence through Elara's choice. Final image of "blooming peace growing from the withering past" reweights the decay motif without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice filters perception through preservation concerns ("paper trail," "echo of lost songs") with controlled modulation from meditative ritual to trembling discovery. The single line of dialogue carries appropriate weight. Minor repetition of "balance" weakens precision but rhythm supports the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density, particularly in the ritual sequences. Some filter-verb clustering ("She knew," "She had") in paragraph five slightly dulls immediacy. The "blooming, withering" motif integrates naturally rather than feeling forced. Final image lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dust-mote reading as navigation system for balance offers a fresh angle on isolation and control. The discovered music as physical artifact of lost songs avoids abstraction. However, the setup of fleeing courier-pigeon trainer discovering composer's pigeon-sent music edges toward convenient convergence, limiting higher scores.</comment>
