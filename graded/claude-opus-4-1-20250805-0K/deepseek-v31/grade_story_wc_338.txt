I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity and perceptive nature drive consistent choices throughout, with concrete embodiment ("heart began to beat a rhythmic thrum"). The whispered gratitude that opens the passage shows earned character-specific action. Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in "listening with her eyes" metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when shadow discrepancy reveals the hidden chamber. The discovery and descent create Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("weight of centuries pressing in"). Orientation anchored early with character, location, and purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vault's physical details constrain choices beautifully—the crack becomes seam, the keystone becomes lock, the shadow's alteration drives discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional priorities ("framer's precision"). The henge as micro-setting charges the final image of "a new map taking shape in the quiet of her mind."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: comparing footage → noticing shadow change → discovering keystone → opening passage → finding ancient henge. The whispered gratitude as key action shows agency with cost. Stakes deepen from historical interest to profound discovery of "the source."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as invitation, known/unknown boundary, listening versus forcing. The final image of Elara "holding its silent, patient gaze" offers resonant answer without stating moral. The conversation between known and unknown reweights all prior mapping metaphors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with map-framer's precision coloring observations ("treating blank spaces...as invitations"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("brutalist construction," "oculus") slightly exceeds POV lexicon. Voice maintains consistency through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("rain-scoured" repeated, "perfect, terrifying boundary"). Template cadence in "She had come...she must...she must" sequence. Information density high in discovery sequence but occasional redundancy ("silent, stone-circle echo").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and archaeology through "cartographer of silence" concept. The method of comparing decades-old footage for minute shadow changes shows ingenuity. Transformation of map-reading into spiritual seeking avoids genre clichés.</comment>
