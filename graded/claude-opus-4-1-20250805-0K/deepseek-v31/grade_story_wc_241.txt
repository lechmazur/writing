<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief (ashes on passenger seat) and her contradictory need to both solve and understand her father. The final journal discovery earns her complicated weeping through accumulated particulars rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some telling about her "theoretically rebellious" trait rather than demonstrating it through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding reweights her father's addiction as calculated grace, with visible emotional cost in her "profound, complicated understanding." The hybrid lens (causal treasure hunt accumulating into textural revelation) holds throughout. Slight weakness in the middle transitions between clue discoveries, but closure lands powerfully with "I stacked the deck for her."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mica lantern's fractured light physically constrains her search path and charges the final understanding. Setting details filter through Elara's analytical POV ("clover melancholy," "probability matrix"). Subway environment and library effectively pressure choices, though some middle passages could be more sensory-specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from solving a puzzle to understanding a man to discovering secret philanthropy, each revelation narrowing Elara's emotional options. The cost manifests in her complicated tears—neither pure sadness nor joy. One meaningful deepening through the people he helped, though middle section could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lucid contradiction of a gambler who "stacked the deck" for others, never stated but embodied in discovered acts. The mica lantern's fractured light becomes the perfect metaphor for seeing her father's fragmented goodness. Final image reweights all prior gambling references without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive academic voice ("probability theorist," "lucid contradictions") modulates into emotional complexity at closure. POV remains tightly controlled through Elara's analytical lens. Some middle passages drift toward exposition ("His gambling for others was his penance"), but voice recovers for the powerful ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("clover melancholy of things both sweet and ended"). Some scaffolding in transitions ("So she went," "She solved them") and filter verbs ("she found," "she studied"). The final paragraph achieves high density with every line advancing meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gambling addiction and mathematical precision, with the original twist of philanthropic gambling as penance. The treasure hunt structure risks cliché but transforms through specific details like "probability matrix involving the timing of the next train." Not groundbreaking but authentically executed.</comment>
