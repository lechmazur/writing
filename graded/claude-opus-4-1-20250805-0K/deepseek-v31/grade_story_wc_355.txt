<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ariadne's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (hands adjusting dials by microns, catching harmonics) and her internal contradiction between cataloging silence and forgiving sound drives genuine change. The epiphany about empathy requiring forgiveness of noise feels earned through specific experience with the journal's sonic waveforms. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of emotional resolution coinciding with fireworks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sonic discovery leading to Conceptual Repricing where Ariadne reweights her entire worldview from silence-worship to embracing "magnificent, noisy silence." The cost is legible in abandoning her lifelong mission's narrow focus ("no longer an assault but a symphony"). Opening the locked clasp through frequency tuning creates causal linkage to the grandfather's sonic catalog discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop setting constrains method (brass coils, polished quartz device) and the fireworks' timing creates pressure that forces realization. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silken quiet, thick and deep," "tiny metallic sigh of surrender"). The spatial choreography of hands on dials and journal is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from unlocking a physical clasp to unlocking understanding of her grandfather's worldview to reconceptualizing her life's work. The fireworks create external pressure that forces internal reckoning. Cost is visible in Ariadne's acceptance that her pure silence catalog must expand to include noise ("To love the silence, one must first forgive the sound").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that empathy requires embracing opposites—the grandfather's catalog includes "music hidden inside things" including cacophony. The final image of Ariadne as "quiet curator" listening to "magnificent, noisy silence" offers resonant non-literal answer to the empathy question. Subtext operates through the journal's non-verbal sonic notations teaching what words couldn't.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Ariadne processes sound ("painting with sound," "varieties of silence"). Voice modulates effectively from meditative opening to revelation. Minor register elevation in philosophical passages ("limitless, theatrical sincerity") slightly exceeds POV's established lexicon but remains comprehensible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and sensory specificity. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("limitless, theatrical sincerity," "generous ears") creates minor register drift. Template phrasing appears briefly ("She had found...She had recovered") but doesn't pervade. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging varieties of silence offers fresh angle on sound/silence dichotomy. The transformation from silence-purist to embracing "noisy silence" feels specific to this character's journey. The sonic frequency method for lock-picking is inventive though the emotional resolution tracks somewhat predictably.</comment>
