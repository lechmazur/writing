<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven transformation from despair to purposeful creation shows clear motivation with embodied contradiction—she sees "no purpose" yet follows the "faint but persistent ember of curiosity." The final realization that jewelry is "genuinely artificial: a real, crafted beauty born from authentic sorrow" earns the closure through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("She was not just a keeper of loss, but a gardener of meaning").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens coheres as Elara moves from grief through discovery to reframing, with the telescope vision providing resonant reconfiguration that reweights her craft's meaning. Cost is legible in "dark, fertile soil" and "raw materials of sorrow," though the journey section with origami coordinates feels mechanically convenient rather than causally earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory's "curtains of intention" and telescope pointing inward create a vivid, constraint-driving setting that enables the final transformation. Early grounding is solid ("silent, dusty aftermath"), and sensory detail ("smelling of ozone and old paper") supports atmosphere, though the journey section relies on summary rather than embodied navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to discovering purpose through the observatory's revelation, with Elara's agency driving the search and interpretation. The indigo curtain vision provides meaningful deepening that reframes her craft, though the origami trail lacks intermediate pressure or cost—it's a breadcrumb path without obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "genuinely artificial" paradox and vision of grief as "dark, fertile soil," avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elara as "a gardener of meaning" with "her heart a timeless observatory" resonantly answers the question of purpose after loss, though "teacher withering to bloom again" edges toward stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("meaningless fragments of jet and onyx") and controlled psychic distance through the vision sequence. Some passages drift toward explanatory ("The vision did not erase her pain; it illuminated it"), and the journey section lacks the textural specificity of the opening and closing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("curtains of intention...shimmering, weightless veils") but suffers from explanatory redundancy ("She saw her hands, not creating genuinely artificial monuments to finality, but weaving..."). Template constructions appear ("Days turned into weeks," "With trembling hands") and the final paragraph contains conceptual loops that restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The observatory as internal rather than external lens and "curtains of intention" as soul-filters offer fresh angles on self-discovery tropes. The "genuinely artificial" paradox and transformation of mourning jewelry from ending to beginning shows conceptual integrity, though the origami trail feels mechanically convenient.</comment>
