<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (terror melting to petrichor nostalgia, the desire for silence versus composing harmonies). The final renunciation of her dream is earned through the bear's acceptance, creating visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "profound exchange" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's dream is "finally returned to the quiet from which it came" with emotional cost visible in the release. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward this reconfiguration. The bear's arrival creates meaningful pressure that forces Elara to confront her abandoned dream.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt constrains choice by drawing the bear and enabling the final exchange through its sound-gathering properties. Vivid sensory detail throughout ("glacial hush," "soft crunch of peat and stone"). The sanctuary setting actively shapes the encounter's quiet nature and resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (making peace with the abandoned dream) is signaled early and deepens when the bear's presence forces Elara to literally offer up her old composition. Cost is visible when the notes transform into light and are absorbed. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as the bear's gentle intrusion reweights Elara's relationship to her dream.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete exchange between Elara and the bear, where listening becomes more valuable than being heard. The final image of the dream "returned to the quiet" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about artistic fulfillment through reception rather than production. The bear as earth-guardian effectively embodies this theme without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Elara's clock-scribe precision ("meticulous gears," "calibrate") and her synesthetic experience of sound as sustenance. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for "profound exchange" and "profound peace" repetition that slightly dulls specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystal whispering forecourt after a night's rain" establishes setting, time, and mechanism). Some figurative density in the bear description borders on overwriting but serves the fantastical moment. Minor template cadence in "It was... It was... It moved..." sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The earth-bear made of roots and stone drinking sound is a fresh synthesis of natural and mystical elements. The specific transformation of musical notes into light absorbed by the creature offers genuine originality. However, the abandoned artist's dream finding peace is a familiar arc that prevents higher scoring.</comment>
