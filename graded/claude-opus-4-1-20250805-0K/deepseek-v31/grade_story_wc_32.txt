I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Alder's frustration leads to rejection of tradition, which drives experimentation, resulting in transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alder's motivation crystallizes with sharp clarity ("he would not mend it; he would interrupt its stifling destiny") and drives consistent action through to the transformative end. Internal contradiction between duty and creative impulse plays out in scene through concrete choices. The "stoically sensitive disposition" manifests in suppressed feeling erupting into decisive action, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("profound revulsion").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from stagnation to rebellion to creative destruction to vivification, with the Decisive Change landing powerfully when the creation rises as "a thing of devastating beauty born from ruin." The cost is visible in the destruction of the sacred relic and the shuddering of the Nexus itself. Who/where/when anchored clearly in opening paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline geode laboratory and "frozen bloom of rose and violet" twilight create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Alder's stifling existence. The Nexus setting directly constrains his choices and the "frozen bloom" shifts meaning when it "deepened toward a true, promising night" at closure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the alchemical process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from simple repair mandate through internal rebellion to destructive transformation, with each experimental failure building pressure ("successive approximation"). The protagonist's agency drives every turn, from rejection to experimentation to final vivification. Cost manifests in the annihilation of the sacred object and the disruption of the Nexus's equilibrium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction versus stifling tradition emerges organically through concrete action rather than assertion. The final image of the hovering helix "offering connection" rather than "demanding obedience" provides resonant answer to the central question. The transformation from "frozen bloom" to "promising night" reweights the entire piece without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("frozen bloom," "sterile reminder"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("coruscating energy," "nascent form") slightly exceeds Alder's established lexicon. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the vivification sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("profound revulsion filled him," "crystallized with a sharp, painful clarity"). Mild overwriting in figurative density during the transformation sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the experimental process description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of an alchemist who destroys rather than preserves offers fresh angle on familiar creative rebellion theme. The specific synthesis of alchemy, religious imagery, and creative destruction feels coherent if not groundbreaking. The vivification through drawing stillness out rather than pushing energy in provides genuine originality in the climactic moment.</comment>
