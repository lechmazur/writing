<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a debt across lifetimes, with embodied emotion in "hands pale as moonstone" and the tear at closure. The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" presence creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "resonant awakening" concept before it crystallizes into the ghost's release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost's release transforms the orchard from decay to thriving life, with visible cost in both the ghost's unraveling and Elara's mixed tear. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and the final cadence shift. The bead discovery and vision sequence provide clear causal linkage to the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with "crystalline panes glowing" and fruits that "hung like swollen, dormant hearts." Setting constrains choice through the orchard's need for emotional sustenance. The carved stone bead functions as micro-setting that enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—settling the life-debt while saving the dying orchard—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes "the debt was not for the life saved, but for the life unlived." The ghost's appearances escalate from ephemeral to solid, culminating in the costly exchange. Minor deduction for relatively low external pressure given the protagonist's existing commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cycles motif (twin serpents) and the paradox of grief as both sustenance and decay. The final silver shoot offers a non-literal answer about renewal through closure. The "life unlived" realization reweights all prior material without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("petrichor and paradox," "lovingly venomous"). POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature filtering the supernatural through botanical metaphors. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("alchemical," "ephemeral") that slightly exceeds the established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb clusters ("She felt the presence," "Elara understood," "She smiled") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the greenhouse description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard that feeds on emotion offers a fresh angle on ghost stories. The specific synthesis of botanical imagery with spectral debt creates originality. However, the ghost-bride-in-wedding-gown and life-debt concepts draw from familiar templates without full transformation.</comment>
