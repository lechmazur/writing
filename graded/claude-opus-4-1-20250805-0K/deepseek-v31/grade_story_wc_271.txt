I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's trauma-driven motivation is embodied through concrete somatic grounding techniques, with contradictory impulses (freeze vs. thaw) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to tend plants despite the freeze demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("somatic markers") but it's dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure (Earned Stasis) - Elara's choice to continue tending plants despite recurring trauma. Cost is visible in the freeze/thaw cycle and the photograph's transformation from clutched anchor to exhibited history. Orientation anchored early (arboretum, keeper, cliff).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum functions as both setting and healing method, constraining choices through its "curated peace." Sensory hierarchy reflects trauma survivor's hypervigilance (thunder/explosion conflation, texture-seeking for grounding). The storm and automated lighthouse beam charge the final image of persistence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining equilibrium against trauma) escalates through storm trigger to freeze response to conscious thawing. The cost is legible in forced physical grounding and the acceptance that "she would feel the freeze again." One meaningful deepening that reweights her relationship to trauma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the negotiation between "brutal realism" and cultivated optimism. The fern's "pure, quiet life" and automated lighthouse's "empty gesture" create resonant contrast. Final image of water drops as choices offers non-literal answer to whether growth over scars is possible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through trauma-filtered attention ("silence...was a living thing"). Voice modulates effectively during freeze episode with compressed syntax. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor register elevation ("pearl of stillness") fits the cultivated sanctuary context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in grounding sequence. Some elevated diction ("percussive whump," "petrichor") but voice-motivated. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop ("she would feel the freeze again, she knew" followed by redundant knowing) and occasional filter verbs during crisis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of PTSD recovery through botanical practice, avoiding therapy clichés through specific embodiment. The somatic grounding technique through texture and plant care offers non-obvious treatment of trauma. Risk-taking in quiet ending that refuses resolution heightens stakes.</comment>
