grade_story_wc_310.txt
I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal** lens - each beat follows because/therefore logic as Alaric processes information, makes discoveries, and arrives at his final choice. The backwards prophecy revelation causes him to reject the peace coin, which causes him to seek its opposite.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric's internal conflict between purpose and doubt drives credible choices under extreme pressure. His shift from "quietly enthusiastic" to "focused desperation" tracks causally with the prophecy revelation. The final choice to offer his own frequency rather than cast a coin demonstrates earned agency, though some philosophical abstractions ("wavelength align with purpose") occasionally replace embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear DC closure - Alaric chooses to feed his own frequency into the cosmos rather than select a pre-existing option. The backwards prophecy creates a genuine reversal that recontextualizes his task. Cost is visible in the blood from the obsidian and the sacrifice of self. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the exact nature of his task.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck and collapsed universe create vivid, constraining atmosphere. The coins serve as tactile, specific objects that embody lost worlds. The obsidian shard's sharp edges provide crucial physical interaction at closure. Setting actively shapes choices, though some descriptions ("non-space outside the crystal viewport") lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from choosing a frequency to avoiding a catastrophic future to sacrificing himself. The prophecy revelation forecloses the peace option and forces a higher-cost choice. The obsidian's physical pain and Alaric's self-sacrifice demonstrate clear, embodied cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of choice versus predetermination emerges organically through the backwards prophecy paradox. The final act of choosing "choice itself" over predetermined options resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the coins representing lost civilizations and the irony of seeing a future created by present action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to cosmic scope. Perceptual signature shows in how Alaric processes the static bursts as "screaming chorus." Some phrases like "wavelength align" and "stellar doubt" feel slightly mannered but serve the otherworldly tone. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("ambered observatory deck," "screaming chorus of every moment"). Some abstract philosophical language ("distill the entirety of condensed reality into a single, perfect frequency") occasionally slows momentum. Minor repetition of "choice/choose" variants, though thematically justified.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy concept offers genuine originality - seeing the future one creates from that future's perspective. The paradox of choosing to avoid a future already seen transforms familiar last-person-alive tropes. Risk-taking in the metaphysical premise pays off with a resonant ending about the nature of choice.</comment>
