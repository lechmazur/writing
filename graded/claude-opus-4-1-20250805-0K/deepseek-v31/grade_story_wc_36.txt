I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered images and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara transforms from keeper to harvester of insights.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her transformed purpose—from protector to student of failure. Her internal journey shows genuine complexity as she confronts her past hesitation with the flute. The final insight about unraveling oneself to weave between worlds emerges naturally from her experience, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("desperate curiosity" could be more embodied).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's transformation from keeper to harvester lands with clear cost (her unraveling, her confrontation with failure's ghosts). The accumulative structure builds coherently through sensory details toward the final insight. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "thunder-echo range" concept, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The thunder-echo range as a place where "sound was a currency spent long ago" creates immediate atmosphere. The negative world's inversion (sky as soil, ground as vapor) provides striking contrast. Most importantly, the driftwood markers constrain navigation choices and the fissure location drives the central action—setting actively shapes the story's progression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding failure to harvest insight—escalates through Elara's progression from arranging markers to crossing worlds to confronting spectral failures. The cost is visible in her willingness to unravel herself. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment; the journey proceeds relatively smoothly once she decides to use the flute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weaving metaphor—dropped stitches, loose threads, the tapestry's underside all build toward the final insight about unraveling oneself to weave between worlds. The story resists easy moralizing, presenting failure as fertile ground for growth. The final image of Elara as "just a woman with a pocketful of hard-won truths" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with phrases like "avalanchingly quiet stillness" and "air itself felt thin, worn out." The voice maintains consistency through pressure, modulating appropriately when crossing worlds. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("catastrophe can grow" feels slightly academic for the established voice).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sound was a currency spent long ago"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Some figurative density in places ("avalanchingly quiet," "fertile ground of failure") without becoming purple. Occasional abstraction ("desperate curiosity," "painful clarity") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a relic keeper confronting her failure through literal world-weaving offers fresh perspective on the redemption narrative. The inverted world as "tapestry's underside" provides original imagery. The transformation of protective duty into harvesting insight from failure avoids typical hero's journey templates, though the quest structure itself is familiar.</comment>
