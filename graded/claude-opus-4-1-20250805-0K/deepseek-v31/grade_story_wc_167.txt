<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's transformation from seeing only "mundane labor" to understanding his craft as creating "rings that would travel outwards" is earned through concrete embodied perception of the ripples. His motivation shift is visceral and specific, though the epiphany edges toward articulated clarity rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elian's shifted perspective, with visible cost in his prior frustration and the impending port expansion that will "shift everything." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the ripple epiphany that reweights his entire craft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism atrium that "fractured the morning light into spectral bands" becomes the workspace where Elian's transformation occurs, with mist and light actively shaping his final realization. The bay's stillness enables the ripple observation that charges the closure, making setting essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening as Elian moves from frustration to throwing the stone to seeing the ripples' meaning, with each beat tightening his understanding. The cost is felt in his prior misplaced motivation and the looming port expansion, though the stakes could press harder in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ripple metaphor elegantly unifies craft, perception, and meaning-making without stating a moral, as Elian realizes his work creates "patterns of meaning they would feel, even if they couldn't name it." The theme emerges from concrete particulars of glass and water rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glazier's perceptual signature consistently filters the world through "flaws waiting for beveled and sealed" and "reflective surfaces," with prose rhythm accelerating during his transformation. Voice remains distinct and embodied throughout, though some passages edge toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail, particularly in "The mist swirled through the open door, catching the colored light." Some figurative density in the middle section ("noctilucent reckoning") and occasional elevated diction ("commune") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fresh synthesis of glazier-as-stone-thrower creating ripples of meaning transforms a craft story into something resonant and unexpected. The specific detail of "judging clarity and distortion" through professional lens adds originality, though the epiphany structure itself is familiar.</comment>
