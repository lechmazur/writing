<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Viola's internal conflict between truth and profit drives authentic tension, with the rosewood pen nib serving as a tangible anchor for her moral struggle. The proof by contradiction sequence shows her working through impulses in scene rather than alternating summaries, though some philosophical passages edge toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear closure through Decisive Change—Viola actively writes the corrective column, foreclosing the lie's path with visible cost to potential profit. The proof by contradiction method drives the middle section effectively, and the final image of her "in sync" with the stars resonates with earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains and shapes Viola's contemplation, with the telescope as "silent judge" and the dome's echoing emptiness amplifying her isolation. Sensory details like "metallic taste" and "copper-wire receiver" ground the abstract moral dilemma, though the setting could more actively pressure her choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to publish a profitable lie—escalates through Viola's logical exercise that reveals catastrophic consequences. Her agency drives the resolution through active intervention (writing the corrective column), with clear cost in choosing "monotonous" truth over sensational profit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orbital metaphor elegantly develops from astronomy through "orbits of regret" to actions having "perihelion of immediate effect and aphelion of long-term consequence." The ending's image of Viola "in sync" with the stars' "silent, truthful dance" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines newsprint heiress sophistication with astronomical precision ("perihelion," "aphelion") and philosophical contemplation. The perceptual signature—seeing moral choices through astronomical frameworks—remains consistent, though occasional passages like "philosophically rotten" edge toward academic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the ghost of the journalist's call still clinging to the copper-wire receiver." Some redundancy in the orbital metaphor explanations and occasional overwriting ("dark, gravitational body pulling at her principles") create minor drag without touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The astronomical lens for examining journalistic ethics offers a fresh angle, particularly the proof by contradiction method applied to moral decision-making. While the truth-versus-lie dilemma is familiar, the specific synthesis of observatory setting, logical methodology, and orbital consequences creates originality.</comment>
