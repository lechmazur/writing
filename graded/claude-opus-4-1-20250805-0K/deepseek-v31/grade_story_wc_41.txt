<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction—she receives visions but immediately loses them, leaving only "tidal longing." The driftwood markers as notes to her future self reveal character-specific problem-solving under this constraint. Her final standing before the plinth, not understanding her own chalk marks but feeling the pull, earns the cost of her condition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara stands before the videotape having both captured and lost the sound, the cycle complete. The cost is legible in "profound and sorrowful pull" and her inability to understand her own markers. The vision-forgetting-echo pattern coheres throughout, with the driftwood method providing causal linkage between her fragmented experiences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden constrains navigation and enables Elara's chalk-marking method—the moisture makes marks fade "within minutes," enforcing her transience. The videotape as singular real object amid ephemeral sculptures charges the final image. Sensory work is selective: "clammy mist," "crunch of gravel," focusing on texture over catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from general searching to following markers to finding the "wrong" arrow that she trusts anyway, culminating in the videotape discovery. The morning vision's "echo still vibrated in her bones" provides the driving force. Cost appears in the final forgetting—she achieves her goal but cannot retain it, standing with "no memory of why she had come."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of transience versus permanence emerges through concrete particulars: ephemeral fog sculptures, fading chalk marks, unwound videotapes. The final image of Elara standing before the tape "holding everything" while she holds nothing resonates without stating a moral. The "sound of growing older" as frequency "between the cracks of seconds" offers a non-literal answer to time's passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm: "her every step a trespass on silence." The perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices echoes, vibrations, pulls rather than surfaces. Free indirect style is clean: "This was the place. The echo within her swelled." No head-hopping, and the compression serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance both external search and internal state. Some figurative density in places ("fish that slipped through her hands," "swimming in tidal longing") but serves the lyric mode. Minor repetition of "profound and sorrowful" and "tidal longing" concepts. The closing image achieves strong resonance with "silent, holding everything."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The precognitive forgetfulness concept is fresh—visions that immediately vanish, leaving only echoes. The driftwood arrow method as communication with an amnesiac future self shows specific invention. The fog sculpture garden setting avoids generic mysticism through concrete details like "pebble-strewn paths" and the crumbling plinth.</comment>
