<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's monthly molting creates genuine internal contradiction between his need to shed identities and his discovered purpose, with the final choice to embrace evolution rather than escape carrying visible cost. The partnership with Elara forces concrete micro-choices (accepting the tin, decoding the poem, committing to the resistance) that reveal his hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas transforms from vagrant escapist to committed revolutionary, with the coffee tin's hidden compartment providing causal linkage to the resistance plan. The cost is legible in his acceptance of the molt as evolution rather than escape, foreclosing his pattern of shedding responsibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library's skeletal dome and moon-lit decay create a lived-in space that constrains choices (sorting salvageable books, working in secret) while the coffee tin's false bottom literally contains the key to transformation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through their sorting work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal shelter-seeking to systemic resistance as the discovered poem transforms book-sorting into revolutionary action. The cost manifests in Silas's impending molt becoming evolution rather than escape, with his vagrant invisibility weaponized for the cause.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of forging beauty from anarchy emerges through concrete action as damaged books become vessels for resistance, with the final image of Silas "rebuilt" offering a non-literal answer to whether transformation requires destruction. The coffee tin transforms from empty payment to revolutionary vessel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "moon-dust" and "luminous fracture" maintains consistency, though some elevated diction ("cathedral," "inscribe") slightly strains the vagrant poet's register. Dialogue between Silas and Elara carries subtext effectively, particularly in "It's empty, but it's solid."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("molts personalities monthly"), but several instances of elevated register ("monumental wreckage," "blooming resistance") and filter constructions ("he felt," "he learned") dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop in "he was rebuilt/had been rebuilt" weakens the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a vagrant using personality-molting as revolutionary camouflage offers fresh angle on resistance narrative, though the prison library book-smuggling plot follows familiar patterns. The coffee tin's false bottom discovery transforms a cliché into meaningful plot mechanism.</comment>
