<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "shrewdly innocent" paradox manifests through concrete choices—believing in peace despite seeing every betrayal, carrying Kaito's cast to surgery as her decryption key. The parallel between child and translator unknotting terror shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "lotus-hearted ache" lacking fuller embodiment in that moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with brain coral pattern recurring from cast to natural form to surgical map, each iteration reweighting meaning. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the "paralyzing charge" gone but "old wound remains," showing clear before/after with felt cost. The experimental surgery based on her decoded patterns pays off the setup elegantly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brain coral's "fractal maze of grooves and ridges" and Kaito's "nervous system of scribbles" create vivid tactile specificity. Setting elements constrain choice—the misty atrium triggers memory, the coral's physical form enables breakthrough. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("sterile edges," "old blood") that could be more particular.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through pattern recognition: chaos on cast → coral discovery → therapeutic application → surgical intervention. The stake intensifies from understanding a child's trauma to rewiring her own PTSD using that same pattern. Cost is visible in submitting to experimental brain surgery based on a child's drawing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The coral/brain pattern elegantly links natural form, trauma expression, and neural rewiring without stating its meaning. "Every maze has a center. And a way out" resonates through Kaito's healing and Elara's surgery. The theme of grafting "new meaning onto old wounds" emerges from concrete action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "chemical sea" and "lotus-hearted ache," though some register elevation ("fractal maze," "neural lightning") slightly exceeds the POV's established voice. Clean psychic distance shifts from operating room to memory. Dialogue is minimal but effective—Elara's whispered words to Kaito carry genuine subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("consciousness receding from the sterile edges"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("lotus-hearted ache," "neural lightning," "chemical sea") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in "She saw...She felt...She spoke." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma therapy through natural pattern recognition—using brain coral's structure to decode and treat PTSD. The specific detail of a child's cast drawing becoming a surgical map feels non-obvious. Some safety in the resolution's completeness reduces risk-taking potential.</comment>
