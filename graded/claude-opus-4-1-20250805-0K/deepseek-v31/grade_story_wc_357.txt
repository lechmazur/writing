I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Causal** - The story follows a clear because/therefore chain: Kaelen seeks the Grovetree's secret → gravity inverts → she follows inverted water → discovers the geode chamber → understands the ecosystem's origin → becomes a guardian.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her through escalating choices with embodied reactions ("stomach lurching," "warmth spread up her arm"). The transformation from pilot to "keeper of the silence" feels earned through specific discovery, though internal conflict could deepen during the chamber revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage throughout with clear closure—Kaelen's transformation into guardian carries visible cost (responsibility for protecting the fragile cycle). The gravity inversion creates meaningful pressure that reveals the hidden chamber, and the arrow tip's discovery chains logically to understanding. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building with the floating rock arches, inverted gravity mechanics, and crystalline geode chamber that constrains Kaelen's choices. The setting actively shapes her navigation method (following water flows) and the environment's unique physics enable the central discovery, charging the final image of "whirling peace."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravity inversion creates genuine crisis ("terrifying sight" of exposed roots) that forces Kaelen to adapt her navigation, leading to discovery. Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to planetary stewardship with clear cost—she must protect what she's found. The pressure coheres well under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the discovery that resilience comes from cycles and memory rather than individual strength. The arrow tip as accidental catalyst and the "gathering of echoes" concept create resonant layers without explicit moralizing, culminating in Kaelen's role shift that reweights the opening quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("whirling silence," attention to water flows). Prose modulates effectively during the gravity crisis with shorter, action-focused sentences. Some elevated diction ("petrified worms," "silicate-grass") fits the otherworldly setting though occasionally brushes against over-writing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues with occasional elevated diction ("intrepid," "vast, fruit-laden groves") and one instance of telling rather than showing ("Kaelen understood") at a pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements—the gravity inversion as revelation mechanism and the concept of stored temporal echoes powering an ecosystem show genuine ingenuity. The broken probe fragment as accidental catalyst transforms the chosen-one trope through specificity and accident rather than destiny.</comment>
