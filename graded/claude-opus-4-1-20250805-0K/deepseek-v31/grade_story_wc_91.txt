<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand transformation's texture drives genuine choices with embodied cost, particularly in releasing the lightning bugs. The old woman functions more as catalyst than pressure-applying character, limiting relationship dynamics. Final transformation from philanthropist to understanding-seeker lands with earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elara gains understanding through loss. The closure lands with felt cost as she walks home "destitute of coin but rich with understanding." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The black sand beach constrains choice—Elara must release her bugs here for the prophecy. Sensory detail ("cool, obsidian grit," "whispering hush") filters through POV effectively. The sand's texture in her fingers charges the final understanding of transformation as "countless individual truths."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to prophetic fulfillment as the old woman reveals Elara's role. The release of bugs shows agency with visible cost—her last possession given. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens but the volcano's calming feels slightly convenient despite thematic fit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the sand's granular texture mirrors transformation's nature as "multitude of tiny moments." The ending reweights Elara's bankruptcy as practice for larger-scale release without moralizing. "Memory of light pulsed within her" offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "roaring river trickled away" and "slow dance of celestial bodies." Some elevated diction ("primordial power," "phosphorescent gloom") occasionally drifts from character register. Dialogue minimal but functional; the old woman's cryptic speech fits her role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dry earth of countless causes"). Some overwriting appears ("vibrant hush that was not an absence of sound but a presence of something waiting" could compress). Minor template cadence in "She had...She felt...She knelt" sequence but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lightning bugs as sole remaining wealth offers fresh angle on destitution. Transformation through granular sand metaphor avoids cliché. However, prophecy-fulfillment and wise-crone archetypes feel familiar despite specific execution.</comment>
