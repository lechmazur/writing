<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellis's face blindness drives genuine internal contradiction between his analytical method and emerging empathy, with the shift from mechanical synthesis to feeling-driven portraiture earning its cost through specific sensory engagement with the ribbon. The transformation from "machine of synthesis" to someone who can "finally see" a face lands with credible weight, though the detective's reaction borders on convenient validation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Ellis's methodical process gradually deepening through empathy until the portrait breathes with consciousness, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where his blindness to faces transforms into true sight. The cost is legible in his permanent alteration ("awakened something long dormant") and the portrait's effect on the detective, though the closure's explanation dialogue ("I didn't draw what they saw. I drew who she was") edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry's "shadowed" depths and persistent mist effectively mirror Ellis's "obscured perceptions" while the studio overlooking this "deep gouge" constrains his isolation and frames his transformation. The burgundy silk ribbon fragment grounds the sensory shift that catalyzes change, though the setting could more actively pressure his choices beyond atmospheric resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds through Ellis's frustration with the "cold" technical exercise until touching the ribbon triggers his empathetic shift, forcing him to abandon pure method for feeling. The dominant stake—whether Ellis can transcend his mechanical approach to truly see—tightens when he must unify "opposites within himself," though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without testing this new synthesis under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of seeing versus perceiving emerges organically through Ellis's progression from cataloguing features to imagining "the pulse at the wearer's temple," with the quarry's mist and the portrait's awakening consciousness creating resonant layers. The final revelation that contradictory witness descriptions were "different pieces of a whole person" reweights the entire investigation, though "I drew who she was" veers toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ellis's perceptual signature—seeing people as "collections of features" requiring "meticulous catalogue"—creates a distinct analytical voice that modulates effectively when empathy enters ("unscientific thought, a feeling"). The prose maintains controlled distance through clinical description ("furrowed hush of graphite lines") that warms during transformation, though some phrases like "lance the abscess" feel slightly elevated for the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation between analytical precision ("surgeon's precision...deep, analytical rhythm") and softer feeling-based sentences, though phrases like "lance the abscess of this stagnant file" and "churned like a sleeping beast" strain the metaphorical coherence. Some redundancy appears in explaining Ellis's condition multiple times, and the final paragraph's dialogue edges toward exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist who paints souls offers a fresh paradox, particularly when combined with cold case work requiring him to unify contradictory descriptions into truth. The transformation from mechanical synthesis to empathetic sight feels earned through specific detail, though the concept of artistic breakthrough through feeling is familiar territory.</comment>
