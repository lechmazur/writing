I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal dominant with Accumulative elements). The story follows a causal chain from hitchhiker disappearance → glass discovery → map decoding → fiddler meeting, but uses accumulative texture (pixelation, mosaic imagery) to build resonance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from "never" to active participant is earned through concrete discovery and choice. The internal conflict between disbelief and compulsion drives authentic action. Minor deduction for the fiddler's convenient waiting position and immediate explanation, which slightly undercuts the earned quality of the revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from vanishing hitchhiker through glass-as-map to fiddler encounter achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (Elias's "never" identity burned away). The glass serving as both portrait and map strains coincidence slightly. Cost is legible in the transformation from passive observer to "participant" and "the man who had answered when the universe whispered."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass flake's dual function as portrait and landscape map effectively constrains choice and enables the path discovery. Mountain setting and waterfall cave provide necessary geography. The "scaffold wrap flutters" metaphor feels forced rather than organic to the world-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from confusion through "luminous disbelief" to active pursuit of understanding. The glass discovery tightens options—Elias must decode or abandon the mystery. Final transformation from courier to participant shows clear cost: his limiting self-concept destroyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pixelated amnesty theme emerges organically through the glass portrait's fragmentation offering forgiveness across time/technology gaps. The daughter's digital-age peace offering to her father resonates without moralizing. Final image of Elias as "the man who answered when the universe whispered" reweights all prior passivity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in Elias's hyper-observant replay of details (seamless coat, clean boots). The fiddler's dialogue ("She believed in second chances") carries appropriate weight without over-explaining. Minor register drift in "luminous disbelief" and "burgeoning" feels slightly elevated for the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid specifics like "wet-plate collodion glass flake, chilled and slightly damp." Some overwriting: "furious, rising spark," "absolute silence," "hard, brilliant certainty" accumulate without adding precision. The "scaffold wrap flutters" construction feels artificially inserted rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glass fragment serving as both antique photograph and pixelated map offers fresh synthesis of old/new technology. The ghost-as-courier delivering family reconciliation through an unwitting intermediary transforms the hitchhiker trope effectively. "Pixelated amnesty" as digital-age forgiveness shows genuine originality.</comment>
