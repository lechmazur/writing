I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory and metaphysical details toward a resonant reconfiguration where Nereus absorbs the goddess's echo.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nereus's cool-headed determination is embodied through concrete actions (stilling hands, measured breaths, forming wordless shapes) that reveal character under pressure. The motivation to "catch the echo of a goddess who had wept the sea into existence" drives every choice with clear stakes. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the internal transformation at closure, though the cost of "anchored by understood grief" lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Nereus absorbs the echo "passing through him and settling deep in his soul" with clear emotional cost ("anchored by understood grief"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through sonic layers to this transformation. The lens holds throughout with excellent causality in the spike-thorn resonance sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory world-building where sound becomes physical architecture ("shimmering hedges of solidified melody," "arches of crystallized chord"). The Sound Wave Garden constrains choices through its non-physical logic, forcing Nereus to use harmonic resonance rather than force. Setting directly shapes the method of resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating sonic intensity from "gentle hum" to "feral lullaby" to the spike-thorn confrontation. The dominant stake (capturing the echo) faces genuine obstacles requiring specific solutions. Cost is visible when Nereus must "pour every ounce" of his determination into the spike and project "absolute quiet."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of catching silence with silence, understanding sorrow through calm determination. The final image of "sleepwalking constellations finally began to find their way home" resonates without stating a moral, suggesting restoration through acknowledged grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register ("star-dusted sky," "coalesced resonance") that maintains consistency. POV modulates effectively from external observation to intense interiority during the spike sequence. Strong perceptual signature in how Nereus processes the garden's logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with varied syntax and strong imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The metal began to vibrate, and a miraculous property of the Garden was revealed"). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in places ("feral lullaby that promised both rampant dreams and tooth-filled nightmares").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic and speculative elements where sound becomes physical architecture. The concept of catching absence through projected silence is genuinely original. The specific method of harmonic resonance using a rail spike transforms expected fantasy tropes. Risk-taking in the abstract closure pays off (+0.3).</comment>
