<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is grounded in watching Silas fail, creating a clear internal drive that compels his experimental action. The contradiction between his youth/assistant status and the "immense weight" he feels creates authentic tension. His final collapse to his knees with the "trembling" vial embodies the cost of his effort, though the resolution feels slightly too neat with the entire fleet responding uniformly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: Elias witnesses failure → creates essence → sends warning → fleet responds. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias proving "whispers travel farther than shouts," though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The orientation anchors (lighthouse, pre-dawn, Elias) arrive promptly. Lens reads as Causal with the because/therefore linkage from intention to result.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse against changing sky colors creates vivid atmosphere, and sensory details like "screaming tenderness" of wind and "phantom garden" scent are distinctive. The spiral stairs and cluttered workroom ground the space physically. The setting actively shapes the solution—the lighthouse gallery provides the vantage point for both problem identification and resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving whispers over shouts while saving the fleet) is established early and tested through Elias's experimental action. The moment of doubt ("Had he been a fool?") before the boats turn provides meaningful tension. However, the resolution lacks complication—every boat responds perfectly, reducing the sense of earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of quiet intention versus loud declaration emerges organically through the contrast between Silas's shouting and Elias's "finer physics." The final image of the "cobalt monument to a quieter, more powerful way to care" resonates without stating a moral. The concept of vibrational intent integrates naturally with the lighthouse keeper's duty of warning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive touches like "screaming tenderness" and "impossible blue." The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to focused action to breathless relief. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias experiences the world through vibrations and essence rather than purely visual cues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("air had been a solid, suffocating thing") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("crystalline thought," "finer physics"). Some redundancy appears in explaining the concept multiple times. The rhythm effectively varies between long atmospheric sentences and shorter action beats, though phrases like "monumental truth" edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of intention-as-vibration transmitted through scent offers a fresh angle on the lighthouse keeper role. The specific detail of moonflowers and damp earth creating a "memory, a promise, a silent call" shows originality. The synthesis of maritime danger with metaphysical communication feels earned rather than gimmicky, though the perfect success of the method reduces risk.</comment>
