I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's understanding transforms from solving emotion to mapping resilience.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - quantifying emotion drives every action. Her internal shift from dissecting to understanding feels earned through the glass eye discovery. The contradiction between her need for logic and recognition of "unsolvable being" lands with genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from trying to solve emotion to understanding it as landscape to be mapped. The cost is legible - she must abandon her original quest for equations and accept ambiguity. The accumulative structure coheres through mathematical imagery building to the revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with bioluminescent fungi and petrified trees creates atmospheric pressure. Setting functions beyond description - the dripping stalactites become "sustaining" not "weeping" after her shift. However, some details remain ornamental rather than constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through deepening rather than reversal - from surface pattern-tracing to three-dimensional understanding to emotional acceptance. The glass eyes enable the key perceptual shift. Cost is clear: Elara must abandon her original mathematical mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete discovery that "mathematics of emotion was the geometry of resilience." The ambiguous loss concept integrates naturally through the keeper's story. The ending reweights everything - persistence over resolution - without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with mathematical precision ("elegant logic," "precise equations") though some passages drift toward purple prose. POV remains stable. However, register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's established lexicon ("gossamer formulae," "moon-kissed hills").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several overwriting issues: "moon-kissed hills," "gossamer formulae," elevated diction in peak moments. Some paraphrase loops ("The loss was still ambiguous, the absence still present"). Information density is uneven - ornamental description competes with meaningful detail. The prose serves the accumulative mode but lacks consistent propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of mathematically mapping emotional absence shows genuine originality. The glass eyes as perceptual tools and the transformation of scientific pursuit into acceptance demonstrate inventive thinking. The synthesis of logic and emotion through "geometry of resilience" feels fresh.</comment>
