<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied action rather than declaration, with her "quiet ache" manifesting in methodical preservation work. The contradiction between invisibility and purpose drives genuine tension, though the final transformation to visibility feels slightly rushed without sufficient intermediate struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from blackout to discovery to revelation, with the tape fragment functioning as a concrete catalyst. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—Elara's act redeems Finch posthumously while accepting her own continued invisibility. Minor orientation lag in the opening paragraph slightly dulls initial momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crawl space world constrains every choice, from navigation "by touch" to the discovery location "behind the periodicals section." Sensory specificity ("insulation dust," "cold iron," "lemon candy and pipe tobacco") grounds the fantastical memory element in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through discovery layers—from searching for data conduits to finding the tape fragment to uncovering Finch's hidden cache. The time pressure ("lights flickered again...Time was short") creates genuine urgency, though the final resolution could use sharper cost articulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of visibility/invisibility resonates through concrete action, culminating in Elara becoming "truly, visible" through anonymous action rather than personal recognition. The parallel between Finch's hidden failure and Elara's hidden service creates layered meaning without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's tactile navigation and her reception of the sense memory. The prose modulates effectively from methodical description to visceral memory flood, though occasional filter phrases ("She understood," "she felt") slightly distance key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm. Some redundancy in the setup ("forgotten conduits and insulation dust, of narrow passages") and occasional abstraction ("her action would be seen") detract from otherwise solid line-level craft. The "sapphire hush" bookending works effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sense memory stored in magnetic tape offers a fresh angle on data preservation, combining technical and emotional archaeology. While the crawl-space perspective provides originality, the resolution of leaving evidence for discovery follows familiar patterns.</comment>
