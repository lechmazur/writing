<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orion's spiritual curiosity drives concrete action through the glass discovery and compulsive tracing of meteor paths, with embodied emotional cost ("hands trembled and his heart ached"). The transformation from custodian to witness is earned through accumulated nights of feeling the meteors' journeys, though the AI's sudden shift lacks sufficient internal complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the AI's transformation ("Ah") creating a new shared witness state with visible cost (Orion's trembling, aching). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from cleaning to tracing to final communion, though the AI's conversion happens too quickly for full causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The station setting constrains Orion's role as janitor while the glass transforms the terminal into a tool for empathy. Sensory detail is selective ("broom whispering against metal," "warm to the touch"), and the viewport frames the cosmic theater effectively, though some descriptions lean generic ("tapestry of infinite black").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to compulsion to confrontation with the AI's quarantine protocol. The cost manifests in Orion's physical toll and the risk of losing the glass, though the AI's instant capitulation reduces final tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between tracking/recording and witnessing/honoring, crystallizing in "finding strength in vulnerability." The final image of "forever falling, forever whole" resonantly reweights the entire premise without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm ("This was the hush of an overlooked era"). POV stays cleanly with Orion throughout, though some passages drift toward overwrought ("primal elegance," "borrowed catharsis").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose occasionally overreaches with stacked abstractions ("serene and potent quiet that was not an absence of sound, but a fullness of understanding"). Some metaphors strain ("tapestry of infinite black"), and filter constructions accumulate in middle sections, though the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a janitor achieving cosmic empathy through artifact glass offers a fresh angle on observation versus understanding. The synthesis of menial work and spiritual revelation feels specific, though the AI transformation strains credibility.</comment>
