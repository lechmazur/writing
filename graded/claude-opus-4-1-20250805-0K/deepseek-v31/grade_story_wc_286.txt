<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deepens through embodied discovery—her hands "thrummed with the memory of the wheel's vibration" grounds her zen-minded nature in physical detail. The progression from passive observation to active participation ("She had not just uncovered the reason... she had become a part of it") shows genuine character evolution with visible cost in her transformed purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final act of pressing "her own intention into the clay," creating vessels that continue the beekeeper's protective legacy. The accumulative lens holds throughout, with each act of kindness building toward the revelation that resistance requires active maintenance, and the cost is legible in her commitment to perpetuate this "sharp gentleness."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned apiary functions as more than setting—it constrains Elara's investigation through what remains (the glass, the boxes) and what's absent (the bees, the life). The phototropic glass as micro-setting brilliantly ties environment to action, only revealing truth through deliberate kindness, making the oasis itself a character that responds to compassion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening understanding rather than external conflict—from curiosity about resistance to active participation in maintaining it. The cost accumulates through Elara's "weeks of quiet, generous work" and crystallizes when she accepts her role as guardian, foreclosing her previous detached observer status.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of resistance as "sharp gentleness"—not passive endurance but "willful tenderness that demanded and received a small exemption." The final image of her fired pots glowing in darkness, joining the oasis's "softer thrum," offers a non-literal answer about how kindness creates pockets of preservation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with selective perception—"the air, thick with the scent of forgotten honey and dust, was a tactile presence." However, some passages drift toward elevated register ("a wish for preservation, for a pocket of peace") that slightly exceeds the established voice's natural range, though the perceptual signature of noticing through craft remains strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"chimney smoke from her small kiln flattened against the heavy sky" establishes setting, weather, and her craft simultaneously. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "fueled by a legacy of care" and some abstract formulations ("resistance wasn't a passive quality") that could be more concrete, but momentum and clarity remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of kindness being phototropic rather than light-responsive is genuinely fresh, transforming the expected scientific property into an emotional mechanism. The synthesis of pottery-as-preservation and gentleness-as-resistance creates an inevitable-feeling resolution that grows from established particulars rather than convenient revelation.</comment>
