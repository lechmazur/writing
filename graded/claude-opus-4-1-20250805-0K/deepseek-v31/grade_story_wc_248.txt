<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's analytically intuitive nature drives concrete choices throughout—seeing patterns in the vandalized tapestry, creating the artistic trail, and choosing witness over possession. Her volcanic tenderness mirrors the archive builder's, earning the final erasure with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("volcanic tenderness") not fully embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara witnesses then re-hides the seed, accepting keeper role. Cost is legible in the erasure sequence ("careful, almost reverential hand") and return to ghost status. The closure lands with earned stasis as she chooses protection over possession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archive setting constrains choices through its labyrinthine structure and hidden mechanisms. Specific details like "petrified wood and etched stone" shelves and the tactile wall mechanism ground the discovery. The seed-in-crystal payoff depends on the physical space. Slight deduction for some generic descriptors ("thick with dust of millennia").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through artistic trail creation, each marker raising commitment to the search. The palm-press moment crystallizes risk before the reveal. Cost manifests in erasure—destroying her own creations to protect the secret. One meaningful deepening through discovery, though physical danger remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vandalized self-portrait metaphor—love so fierce it must be hidden. The seed represents hope protected by apparent destruction. Elara's choice to witness rather than possess, then erase her trail, embodies this paradox. Final image of "keeper of a gentle, sleeping fire" resonates without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with selective perception fitting Elara's analytical nature. Some elevated diction ("volcanic tenderness," "monolithic solemnity") occasionally drifts from established register. Strong control in discovery sequence. Voice modulates appropriately during the erasure ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Multiple instances of abstract phrasing ("volcanic tenderness" appears twice, "monolithic solemnity") and some template constructions ("She began to," "She was the"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story but some descriptive passages could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle on archive/discovery trope through the vandalized self-portrait concept and choice of witness over possession. The artistic trail creation method and ultimate erasure add originality. Specific details ground the piece, though some elements (ancient seed preservation) echo familiar templates.</comment>
