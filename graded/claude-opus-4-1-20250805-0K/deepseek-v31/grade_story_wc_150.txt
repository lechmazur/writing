<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and builds through concrete discoveries, with the sundial revelation creating genuine character change. The internal journey from "quietly desperate" to integrated participant shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("comfortable, foreign practicality") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure that builds through discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where nature's completion of the sundial reweights Elara's entire journey. The cost is felt in her acceptance that "interruption could create a new, more beautiful path." The closure lands cleanly with the tree-as-gnomon insight transforming her understanding of restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard vividly fuses life and death through specific sensory detail ("roots delving deep...to weave a skeletal lace between femurs and skulls"). Setting actively constrains and enables choices—the collapsed section creates the problem, the tree's shadow provides the solution. The environment becomes inseparable from the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal restoration to understanding interruption itself as creative force. The missing gnomon creates genuine obstacle that forces contemplation and observation. Cost is legible in Elara's shift from active excavation to patient witnessing, though the resolution comes through observation rather than harder choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physical sundial becoming metaphor for interrupted journeys creating "new, more beautiful paths." The tree-as-gnomon discovery offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image of roots "forever intertwined with those who had come before" resonantly reweights the entire journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature in how Elara notices details ("fingertips brushing against stone walls that hummed with residual sun-warmth"). Voice modulates appropriately from searching uncertainty to contemplative acceptance. Some elevated diction ("spectacular, haunting fusion") occasionally drifts from character register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones"). Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("comfortable, foreign practicality," "quietly desperate motivation") and occasional overwriting ("spectacular, haunting fusion") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora return narrative with archaeological discovery and natural completion. The tree-as-gnomon twist feels earned and transforms the restoration concept. The specific fusion of catacomb and orchard creates memorable imagery, though some elements feel slightly familiar in literary fiction contexts.</comment>
