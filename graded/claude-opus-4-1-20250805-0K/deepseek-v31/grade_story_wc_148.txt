I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited familial trauma, with concrete embodied tension as he confronts the Warden. The transformation from lies to truth-telling shows genuine character movement with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "sustaining impossibilities" that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelen's truth-telling through the lattice transforms both the Warden and his inheritance. The cost is legible in his confrontation with family shame and the weight of "bodies yet to be found." Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, chapel) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and deconsecrated chapel create atmospheric pressure, with specific tactile details like "fingers finding purchase in worn grooves." The lattice functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables the climactic choice. Slight deduction for generic descriptors like "cold and tasted of dust."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical entry to spectral confrontation to emotional revelation, with the lattice transforming from object sought to active tool. The Warden's appearance raises immediate mortal threat that Kaelen meets with unexpected truth rather than lies. Cost is visible in breaking generational patterns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of lies into filtered truth, with the lattice serving as both literal and metaphorical filter. The ending reweights the family curse without moralizing, showing how truth can be both terrible and liberating. "We were afraid" resonates as the core revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation matching the gothic atmosphere, though occasionally drifts toward overwrought ("coalescence of gloom and memory"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but the whispered truths carry authentic subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and atmospheric rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("spectral guardian... swirling concentration of every desperate plea") and abstract phrasing ("sustained impossibilities," "thread the labyrinth"). Information density is good but could be tighter in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh take on the Boy Who Cried Wolf legacy through generational trauma and spectral confrontation. The Warden of Echoes and the lattice-as-filter concept show genuine originality. Some elements feel familiar (lighthouse gothic) but the synthesis of inherited lies and filtered truth offers a memorable angle.</comment>
