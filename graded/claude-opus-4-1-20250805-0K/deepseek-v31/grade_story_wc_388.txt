I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from discovery to understanding, with each revelation narrowing Elara's options until she reaches her final decision.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with strong interiority during the letter reconstruction showing contradictory impulses between exposing truth and protecting it. The final choice to leave the diamond buried is earned through her transformation from debunker to protector, with visible cost in abandoning her life's work. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tapestry of comfortable lies") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from investigation to discovery to decision, with the stillpoint revelation serving as the decisive change that reconfigures Elara's worldview. The cost is visible in her choice to protect rather than expose, sacrificing her identity as a debunker. The closure lands with "protecting the truth so the lies, for once, could continue to comfort" showing clear before/after with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard setting constrains choices effectively - the storm traps Elara with the letters, forcing discovery. Sensory details like "fine, radioactive grit" and "sickly green against the perpetual orange haze" create atmosphere while the orchard's paradox drives the investigation. The setting could more actively shape the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from simple debunking to world-changing discovery to moral choice about weaponization. The storm creates pressure that forces Elara's work forward, and the revelation about the stillpoint raises the cost of exposure. The final decision shows clear agency with visible trade-off between her compulsion for truth and protecting the sanctuary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the reversal of "comfortable lies" - initially Elara sees the settlers' superstition as cushioning against reality, but discovers her own assumption was the comfortable lie. The stillpoint concept resonates both literally (the diamond's effect) and metaphorically (inner peace amid chaos), with the ending offering a non-literal answer about when protection matters more than exposure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with scientific precision ("null-energy," "crystalline structure") appropriate to Elara's expertise. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the storm sequence. Some filter phrases ("She could intuit," "She understood") slightly dull immediacy but serve the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("tapestry of comfortable lies stretched over ugly truths") and occasional redundancy ("violent gust shook"). Strong information density in the letter reconstruction sequence. The final paragraph achieves good resonance despite one instance of elevated diction ("newly scoured landscape").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-apocalyptic setting with the scientific mystery of radiation-neutralizing flaws in crystals. The reversal of the debunker choosing to preserve rather than expose myth shows originality. The stillpoint concept as both physics and philosophy adds conceptual depth beyond typical wasteland narratives.</comment>
