<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grim optimism drives every choice with clear internal consistency, from her "elegant misery" perception to her final sideways escape. The contradictory impulses of accepting confinement while seeking solution play out through concrete actions (dice experiments, chalk equations). Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where her mathematical proofs suddenly work after "epochs" of failure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal lens with clear Decisive Change: perpetual vertical motion redirected to lateral escape through accumulated mathematical understanding. The chip as "exogenous variable" provides the key causally, and the cost is visible in the "fresh, minute fracture" on the die. Orientation anchors (mathematician, staircase, dice) establish immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase constrains every choice and enables the final escape through its perpetual motion properties. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("worn boots scuffing," "cool, flat moss"). The environment's self-resetting property (chalk fading after ten paces) reinforces the prison's logic while the "twisting geometry" payoff uses setting as mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking "a flaw" to "redirecting" motion to the climactic calculated risk of the one-thousandth step maneuver. The dominant stake (escape through understanding) tightens when she shifts from breaking to commanding the system. Cost is legible in the "terrifyingly daring maneuver" with potential "fall into nothingness."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "boundless confinement" resolved by transforming constraint into possibility. The dice's imperfection as necessary variable resonates without stating a moral. The ending reweights the "missed opportunity" from hollow ache to "profound uncertainty," though the mathematical abstraction slightly distances emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct mathematical-minded voice with controlled diction ("theorem of boundless confinement," "axiomatic structure"). POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual signature (seeing equations, calculating vectors). Minor register elevation in philosophical passages ("hollow ache for the profound uncertainty") slightly exceeds the established voice's range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean prose with varied syntax and strong information density, particularly in technical passages. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("geometric purgatory," "exogenous variable") but serves the mathematical POV. The final paragraph's "grim optimist in an infinite world" effectively echoes the opening without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mathematical approach to escaping infinite imprisonment offers a fresh angle, particularly using the die's imperfection as the solution key. The specific synthesis of perpetual motion physics with non-Euclidean geometry feels earned. Slightly derivative in the portal-escape resolution, though the sideways trajectory adds distinction.</comment>
