<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's internal conflict between enlightenment and protection manifests through concrete embodied actions (handling the rope, laying it in a circle) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation is earned through his prison escape parallel, though the energy beings lack sufficient pressure as antagonists.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Aris's circular rope placement forecloses enlightenment with visible cost ("the texture of time...was not a thing to be felt"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation and the mirror-moment payoff, though the energy beings' proposition arrives somewhat abruptly at midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's transformation from "cool and dry" to pulsing with "soft, internal light" constrains Aris's choice spatially and symbolically. Terra-cotta walls holding starlight create atmospheric pressure, though more sensory specificity beyond visual/tactile would strengthen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The impossible choice escalates from curiosity to ethical dilemma with clear cost: gain enlightenment but unleash chaos, or protect the world and remain ignorant. The "cruel playfulness" tightens options effectively, though the stakes of "potential chaos" remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rope's transformation from escape tool to boundary symbol offers a non-literal answer to seeking time's texture—it's "the space between one breath and the next, the quiet momentum of a choice made." The prison/freedom parallel deepens without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through philosophical wanderer's lens ("texture of time," "cascade of decisions") with controlled psychic distance. The elevated register fits Aris's poet identity, though occasional abstractions ("profound, destabilizing gifts") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the choice sequence. Some abstract phrasing ("potential chaos he could not measure," "passionate subtlety radiated") and filter constructions ("He felt them trace") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of communication through artifacts and impossible choices offers a fresh angle on first contact narratives. The rope's dual symbolism (escape/binding) and the non-violent invasion through "quiet luminescence" transform expected tropes, though the energy beings' nature remains somewhat generic.</comment>
