<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's transformation from glass artist to survival-focused justice-seeker is well-motivated through concrete pressures, with her "steadily adaptive" trait shown through specific actions like learning to trap rabbits and decoding frost patterns. The internal contradiction between her artistic past and pragmatic present creates genuine tension, though some moments edge toward over-articulation ("granular" purpose feels slightly diagnostic).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens with clear closure: Lyra's discovery leads to purposeful action, transforming her from passive survivor to active architect of revelation. The cost is visible—she must risk exposure and use her painful past (glass artistry) to expose the truth. The frost-to-ledger-to-relay chain maintains tight causality throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively constrains and enables choices—the frost patterns reveal the ledger, the climb tests her adaptive skills, and the silence becomes a tool for amplification. Sensory details like "fine, grey dust of charcoal" and "brittle morning" are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions ("brilliant stars") trend generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds naturally from survival to discovery to purpose, with each revelation tightening options—the ledger demands investigation, the relay requires a dangerous climb, the message forces moral action. The final stakes shift from personal survival to ecological salvation shows clear cost: Lyra must abandon her safe anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of destruction into revelation—fire that was meant to silence becomes the medium of truth. The "pauses between breaths" evolve from emptiness to spaces for reflection to opportunities for action, creating resonance without explicit moralizing. The glass-to-justice transformation offers a non-literal answer to finding purpose after trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—an artist's eye for patterns and light pervades the narration. Some passages achieve strong voice ("grammar of ascent"), though occasional register elevation ("calcined," "granular") slightly exceeds Lyra's established lexicon during stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-pressure moments ("drifting resonance," "hollow echo") and occasional abstract phrasing ("scorched testament of her former existence"). The final paragraph's metaphorical cluster about light/glass/justice, while thematically apt, slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of an artist's aesthetic knowledge becoming crucial to exposing ecological crime offers fresh synthesis. The frost-as-revelation mechanism and the transformation of artistic medium from glass to justice show genuine ingenuity, though the ecological conspiracy plot itself trends familiar.</comment>
