<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's dual motivation (professional duty vs. private vocation to discover what ceilings hide) creates genuine internal tension that drives his final choice to engage the ghost. His professional competence in observing patterns transfers believably to supernatural perception. The ghost girl's characterization, though minimal, efficiently conveys her trapped heroism through the single gesture pointing upward and her relief at being witnessed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage: Leo's ceiling obsession → discovery of mainspring → vision of girl's heroism → choice to engage. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Leo breaks his rule of non-engagement, with visible cost in his "rough voice" and the weight of carrying her story forward. The orientation anchors (abandoned circus, elevator technician, ghost-seeing) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dust patterns function as both forensic evidence and temporal map, constraining Leo's discovery path. Sensory layering (fluorescent buzz dying, "sweet-and-sour ghost of popcorn," dust motes as "lazy confetti") creates atmospheric density. The mainspring barrel in its "nest of brittle wire and rodent-gnawed paper" provides tactile specificity that grounds the supernatural elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to maintain professional distance or acknowledge the ghost's heroism—escalates through the vision sequence where Leo witnesses her sacrifice. The cost manifests in his breaking of personal protocol ("never to engage") and accepting the "cool, solid truth" of her story. However, the conflict could benefit from more resistance before his choice to engage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "cracks in the façade" operate literally (plaster cherubs) and metaphorically (hidden heroism), with the girl's fractured story mirroring the building's physical deterioration. The weightless burden transforms from Leo's passive ability to an active responsibility. The final image of the mainspring as "cool, solid truth" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening's emphasis on mechanical repair into human restoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Leo's perceptual signature filters everything through technical assessment ("wear on a sheave wheel," "alignment of guide rails"), creating a distinct professional lens that makes his supernatural sight more credible. The prose rhythm accelerates during the vision sequence with longer, breathless sentences, then contracts to simple declaration: "I see you." Minor filter verb accumulation ("He saw," "Leo saw") slightly dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "dust motes, suddenly liberated from the shuddering light, drifted in the dimness like lazy confetti." Some repetitive sentence openings ("He saw," "Then he saw") create mild template cadence. The final paragraph's clean, declarative sentences effectively contrast the earlier descriptive density, creating purposeful rhythm shift at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator technician expertise with ghost-seeing creates a fresh angle on supernatural detection through forensic observation. The specific detail of the horologist's mainspring barrel as the ghost's anchor avoids generic haunting tropes. The transformation of professional distance into engaged witness provides an earned emotional arc rather than stock ghost-story resolution.</comment>
