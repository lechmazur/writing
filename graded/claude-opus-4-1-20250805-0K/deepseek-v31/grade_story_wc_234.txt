I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of metaphor and pattern (spiral, growth, rhythm) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lyra's approach transforms from containment to symbiosis.

<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is concrete and embodied through her failing star, with clear internal conflict between control and organic flow. The transformation from forcing to guiding is earned through Kael's intervention and the nautilus metaphor. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around "density of presence" that could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the star transforms from "captured thing into a symbiotic one" with visible cost (weeks of failed work) and conceptual shift. The accumulative lens holds as spiral logic accumulates to reweight Lyra's entire approach. Orientation anchors (Ember Nexus, twilight, alchemist) establish quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Ember Nexus setting with its "thousand self-sustaining reactions" creates atmosphere and mirrors the central tension. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice - its spiral logic directly shapes Lyra's solution. Sensory detail is selective but could be more varied beyond visual/tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear - weeks of work failing, the need to capture "density of presence." The spiral discovery creates meaningful deepening that changes Lyra's options from force to flow. Cost is visible in the abandoned approach and emotional investment, though the resolution feels slightly smooth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the force/flow dichotomy and spiral metaphor without stating morals. The final image of the star "forever becoming more" resonantly answers the central question about capturing moments. Strong integration of organic growth versus mechanical containment throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with scientific-poetic register ("pocket-sun alchemist," "condensed essence"). Kael's dialogue carries appropriate subtext about growth versus freezing. Some filter verb accumulation ("She saw," "feeling") and occasional register elevation that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrasing ("profound weight of a moment truly and fully lived") and filter verbs cluster in places. The spiral metaphor risks over-extension but maintains coherence. Information density is good but could be tighter in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of alchemy with star-creation and the nautilus-as-method offers fresh synthesis. The transformation from containment to symbiosis provides a non-obvious answer to capturing presence. The "pocket-sun alchemist" concept and resolution through organic pattern rather than force shows genuine originality.</comment>
