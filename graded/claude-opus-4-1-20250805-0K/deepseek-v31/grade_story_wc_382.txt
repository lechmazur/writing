<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn the building's language drives consistent choices, with internal conflict between curiosity and the comfort of "agreed upon lies." The revelation of Mr. Valerius as a literal ghost/custodian is earned through accumulated details (cool skin, never leaving roof). Final transformation from student to scribe shows meaningful change with visible cost (isolation, inherited responsibility).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (meteor shower, revelation) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara stands alone with the seal, transformed into the building's new scribe with clear cost (Mr. Valerius's dissolution, inherited vigil). The "agreed upon lies" dissolving under meteor light creates decisive conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden functions as more than setting—it constrains choices (Mr. Valerius bound to roof) and charges the final image (Elara alone in the garden). Sensory details filtered through POV ("fragrant exhalation of damp earth," "brittle skeletons of autumn"). The building itself becomes setting through its "dialect of stress and resilience."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from learning a building's language to inheriting a supernatural custodianship. The "agreed upon lies" create tension that builds toward revelation during meteor shower. Cost is legible: Mr. Valerius fades/dies, Elara accepts isolation and responsibility. One meaningful deepening through the reveal, though could use stronger mid-story pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: language as connection between living and dead, permanence versus transience. The seal's "word of permanence" gains resonance when Elara inherits it. Final image of solitary scribe reweights all prior teaching moments without stating a moral. The building's language becomes literal and metaphorical bridge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("papery rustle," "patiently nimble") though "patiently nimble" repeats awkwardly. POV maintains appropriate distance and knowledge boundaries until revelation. Minor slip with untranslated Chinese character "透明" disrupting flow. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("The last tenant who asked for sugar...").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears twice creating repetitive phrasing (-0.4). Untranslated character "透明" breaks reading flow (-0.3). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("celestial spectacle," "silent detonations") but doesn't obscure closure. Otherwise clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with language tutoring creates non-obvious angle. The literal "dead language tutor" transforms expected metaphor. Building as living entity with its own dialect shows originality. Risk-taking in making supernatural reveal work within literary frame, though concept of inherited custodianship is somewhat familiar.</comment>
