I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discoveries and sonic echoes toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's testimony transforms understanding of language's continued growth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deepens through concrete discovery—from studying dead words to understanding living meaning. Her transformation from isolation to testimony is earned through the crystal's revelations. The janitor provides minimal but effective secondary pressure that validates her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from silence to chorus. The crystal shard discovery triggers cascading revelations that reweight the library's purpose, culminating in Elara's testimony that proves language still grows through reunderstanding. Closure lands with visible cost (breaking isolation) and conceptual repricing of "finished" language.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains and enables—the chandelier holds history, the crystal shard becomes tool, the vast shadowed space emphasizes isolation then connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The chandelier's dual nature (light/sound archive) effectively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private obsession to public testimony through the crystal's revelations. Elara's choice to climb and speak despite her reticent nature shows agency with cost. The janitor's awakening provides external validation of her risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete discovery—growth exists in spaces between words, in reunderstanding rather than invention. The chandelier-as-archive metaphor resonates without being stated. The final image of ongoing testimony despite "finished" dictionaries offers a non-literal answer to whether language can still grow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision with moments of lyric elevation ("suspended hush," "teardrop crystals"). Some register drift occurs ("weathered innocence" feels imposed). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that tightens during discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation. However, abstract phrases like "weathered innocence" and "fossil record of collective thought" drift into academic register. Some redundancy in explaining the chandelier's nature. The "gentle storm" oxymoron strains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-morgue with library-as-seed-vault through the sonic chandelier concept. The idea that language grows through reunderstanding rather than new words offers genuine insight. Specific detail (crystal's sonic properties, fractured time sequences) elevates familiar territory.</comment>
