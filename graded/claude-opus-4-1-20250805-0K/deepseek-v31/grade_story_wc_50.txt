<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is rooted in her "peripherally focused" nature and obsessive need to preserve wonder, driving her descent and meticulous repair work. Her methodical approach reveals character through action, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during the repair sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal structure: broken echo engine discovered → reverse-engineering → repair → restoration of the land's "hidden heart." Closure lands with the "promise stored deep in the stone," showing cost through the wounded season's persistence and Elara's solitary dedication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern's acoustics function as both setting and problem, with veins of quartz, specific curves, and fissures constraining Elara's method. The environment directly shapes her solution through "reflection angles" and "paths of silence and song."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal obsession to land-wide consequence as Elara discovers the echo engine's true function. The pressure tightens through technical challenge, though more visceral cost during the repair work would strengthen the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "storing wonder in the cellar of reason," paid off when mechanical precision restores magical resonance. The final image of the echo as "promise stored deep in the stone" reweights the opening's wounded season without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("peripherally focused," "harvest of echoes") and consistent POV. Some elevated register in places ("polyphonic hymn") but maintains coherence through Elara's craftsman perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some density issues appear ("complex, ancient device of interwoven brass and crystal"). The typo "tuned水晶 prisms" breaks immersion, and occasional elevated diction ("polyphonic hymn of returning sound") slightly overreaches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical craft with mystical resonance, avoiding fantasy clichés through specific technical detail. The concept of an "echo engine" that sustains land through sound offers genuine novelty, though the wounded season backdrop is somewhat generic.</comment>
