Looking at this story through an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered celestial imagery and magnetic resonance toward a moment of awakening rather than following strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's core contradiction between impatience and patient waiting is well-embodied through "coiled spring in her chest" and her "fierce, contained energy." The transformation from restless mapper to "devoted guardian" lands with earned cost - she sacrifices her impatience for a deeper purpose. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "sculpt patience from impatience."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the awakening transforms both sanctuary and protagonist - "The revolution was not an attack; it was an awakening." The cost is legible in Elara's transformation from impatient revolutionary to guardian. Slight weakness in the middle section's pacing, but the accumulative structure holds and the lens remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct and basalt sanctuary function as active constraints - the viaduct channels celestial energy, the sanctuary holds hidden knowledge. Vivid sensory work: "Water droplets clung to its iron-rich surface, each one catching the newly revealed starlight." The frozen lake becomes a transformative lens, directly participating in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation - from tracking, to storm passing, to triple moon convergence, to awakening. The dominant stake (patient revolution vs impatience) tightens as the moment arrives. Cost is visible in Elara's final transformation, though the middle section could use one more beat of active pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox of "patient revolution" - change that requires waiting rather than forcing. The final image of clarified ice as a "lens that would now reflect truer stars" offers resonant non-literal answer. Strong integration of patience/impatience motif throughout without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent elevated register fits the mythic tone, with controlled modulation during the awakening sequence. POV remains stable with Elara's selective perception of celestial and geological details. Some filter phrases ("She felt," "She understood") slightly dull immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "mercury-bright gleam" and "stone waking from a millennia-long sleep." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "patient revolution" concept restated multiple times, and some template phrasing in transitions ("She stood," "She checked," "She looked").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial mapping with geological awakening offers a fresh angle on revolution narratives. The magnetic viaduct as conductor of cosmic energy is distinctive. The ending's reframe - revolution as land remembering itself rather than violent overthrow - provides genuine surprise that feels earned.</comment>
