<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and his internal state well-embodied through "calmly inventive focus" and precise movements in darkness. The confrontation with Vorlag creates genuine tension between duty and revolution, with her conflict visible in "rigid loyalty warring with a deeper, suppressed desire." Minor deduction for slight emotional summary ("remarkably serene") and the revolution's mechanics remaining somewhat abstract despite the concrete sun-steel sliver.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: blackout enables Lysander's plan → he retrieves hidden tool → etches symbols → confronts Vorlag → reveals purpose → revolution begins. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with Vorlag's transformation and the network awakening, though the cost remains more implied than visceral. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The darkened fort setting directly enables the plot, with specific details like the "forgotten balcony," "half-painted sundial," and "bronze balcony rail" serving as functional elements. The sun-steel's "faint, warm pulse" provides sensory contrast to the blackout. Setting constrains choice effectively but lacks the vivid specificity that would elevate further—the fort remains somewhat generic beyond its functional elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk (Lysander's treachery accusation) to systemic change (silent revolution), with Vorlag's arrival creating immediate pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through his calculated reveal of the sun-steel. However, the revolution's success feels somewhat predetermined; the "sleeper agents" awakening lacks visible resistance or cost that would deepen the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between hoarded light (vault) and shared illumination (revolution), with the sun-steel sliver embodying this tension. The ending's "unlocking minds instead of doors" and transformation "without a single shout" offers resonant answers about peaceful change. Subtext operates well in Vorlag's conflicted response and the "winking hush" of conspiracy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to fantasy with phrases like "marrow of his bones" and "obsidian monolith." POV remains stable in close third, with Lysander's perception filtering events. Dialogue between Lysander and Vorlag carries subtext effectively, though limited to brief exchanges. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that borders on purple ("profound dark").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwriting appears: "vigilant guardian" redundant with "sentinel," "profound dark" where "darkness" suffices, and slight template cadence in "He moved... He ran... He worked." The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a guardian enabling revolution from within offers a fresh angle on the betrayal narrative. The sun-steel sliver as both light source and communication device shows inventive world-building. However, the revolution's mechanics (harmonic frequencies awakening sleeper agents) feel somewhat convenient, and the transformation happens too smoothly without meaningful resistance or complication.</comment>
