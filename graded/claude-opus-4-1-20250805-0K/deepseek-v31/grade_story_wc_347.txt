<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in experience ("finding too many lost souls"), with genuine internal conflict between reluctance and duty. The woman's terror is embodied effectively. However, the piece relies on discovery of the blueprint rather than character-driven choice at the crucial turn, and Kaelen's transformation from caretaker to problem-solver lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear closure—the nut-as-key revelation transforms the labyrinth from prison to navigable space, with visible cost in the frost threat. The blueprint discovery drives the resolution logically. Minor deduction for the convenient timing of the woman's accidental discovery, though it serves the causal chain well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth's shifting paths and mechanical birds create genuine spatial pressure that constrains choices. "The map isn't in the stone, it's in the air" demonstrates how setting shapes Kaelen's navigation method. The frost deadline and treacherous maze directly pressure the resolution, though the orchard remains somewhat disconnected from the immediate action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear escalation from wanderer spotted to birds diving to discovery that transforms understanding. The frost deadline creates genuine urgency. However, the resolution depends more on fortunate discovery than protagonist agency—Kaelen uses the key, but the woman's stumbling reveals it, slightly weakening the agency component.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of hidden design versus apparent chaos emerges organically through the blueprint revelation. "The map isn't in the stone, it's in the air" resonates beyond literal navigation. The final image of light-painted paths offers a non-literal answer about perception and purpose, though the thematic weight could deepen further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in "offhandedly exact" knowledge and distinctive voice throughout. "The sound as offhandedly exact as his knowledge of the sun-bleached bones" establishes voice immediately. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext ("I've tried every path"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in technical descriptions that briefly diverges from Kaelen's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with strong rhythm variation and vivid imagery. "Bronze feathers scraping against the rock with a sound like a dying scream" demonstrates effective sensory specificity. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor figurative density in places ("graceless beauty" recurs) but serves the tone effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mechanical birds as both threat and solution system offers genuine freshness. The concept of navigation through air pressure rather than stone paths provides an original angle. The nut-as-key revelation transforms familiar elements, though the blueprint discovery mechanism feels slightly convenient.</comment>
