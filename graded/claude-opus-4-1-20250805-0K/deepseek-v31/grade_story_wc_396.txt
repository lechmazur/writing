<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied perception as she processes Kael's desperation and maps it onto her understanding of dynamic peace versus static guardianship. The shift from "prescribed purpose" to active intervention lands with genuine cost—abandoning her post—though the interiority occasionally drifts toward mild abstraction ("profound understanding"). Strong contradictory impulses act in scene when she weighs duty against broader oath.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage: fragment brings plea → mirrors reconstitute vision → mobilization saves village → Elara's understanding of peace transforms. Decisive Change lands with visible cost (abandoning post, risking authority) and conceptual repricing of "peacekeeper" role. The mirror-vision sequence provides elegant causality without overexplaining.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes establishes immediate spatial stakes, while the vintage store's mirrors become active setting that enables the solution. Sensory details like "words frosting in the air" and "salt-bleached town" anchor POV perception. The environment constrains choice when Elara must leave her post to access the mirrors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from territorial intrusion to village survival with clear tightening when the reconstituted vision reveals "timeline imminent." The avalanche threat provides coherent external pressure that forces Elara's choice between static duty and dynamic intervention. Cost is visible in abandoning her post and the physical/social effort of mobilization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of "peace" from static guardianship to dynamic intervention, avoiding explicit moralizing. The mirrors-as-memory concept adds textural depth while the final image of the fragment as "symbol of a future chosen" resonantly reprices the opening's rigid duty. Subtext operates cleanly through Elara's intuitive reading of Kael.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent shadow-laced mysticism through selective perception ("weighted breath before reply") and controlled diction. Some passages edge toward elevated register ("reconstitute the vision") but remain within Elara's established lexicon. Dialogue naturalism suffers slightly from Kael's overly articulate desperation, though it carries goal-pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though several abstract phrases weaken immediacy ("profound understanding," "dynamic force"). The mirror sequence demonstrates strong information density with each reflection advancing the vision. Minor template cadence appears in the mobilization paragraph ("She used... She showed them...") but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reconstitution-through-mirrors concept offers fresh specificity beyond typical prophecy-restoration, with each mirror type revealing different temporal aspects. The transformation of "peacekeeper" from guardian to interventionist provides non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in the fragmented vision assembly heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
