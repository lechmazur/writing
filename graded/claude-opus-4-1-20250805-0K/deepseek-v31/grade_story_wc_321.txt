I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This is a Causal story - Felix's understanding of the temporal crisis leads to specific actions (using the hourglass and radio) that resolve the problem through clear because/therefore linkages.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Felix's motivation crystallizes with "instinctual clarity" about the unwriting, driving his decisive actions. His "resiliently positive" nature functions under pressure, though interiority lacks deeper contradiction. The final keeper role lands with earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure: Felix's broadcast merges timelines with visible cost ("permanent transient tone to Felix's reality"). The hourglass transformation from empty relic to temporal anchor provides clear before/after. Orientation anchors early ("evening rush," "ferry deckhand").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spectral grotto's "impossible dimensions" and "captured starlight" create vivid otherworldly pressure. The hourglass as micro-setting constrains choice effectively. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from deck to helm to resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from commuters "flickering" to "being unwritten" to Felix's decisive intervention. His agency drives resolution through radio broadcast. Cost lands in his permanent altered perception, though mid-story pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "permanent" journey versus "transient" passengers, with Felix as threshold keeper. The empty hourglass gaining purpose resonates. However, some thematic articulation feels slightly overt ("silent keeper of the threshold").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent maritime register ("nor'easters," "keel") with controlled rhythm under pressure. POV remains stable. Minor elevation in diction ("ardent," "spectral") fits the fantastical shift without breaking character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery. Information density high in crisis beats. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("cavern of impossible dimensions," "luminous web") but doesn't obscure clarity. Final image resonates without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry routine with temporal crisis feels specific and earned. Using radio to broadcast across timelines rather than for rescue shows ingenuity. The "permanent transient" paradox and Felix as threshold keeper offers non-obvious depth.</comment>
