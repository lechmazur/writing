<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sir Valerius's transformation from withdrawn knight to unburdened man is earned through concrete physical acts (removing armor piece by piece) with visible cost. The internal conflict between guilt and liberation manifests in embodied details like "joints protesting" and "hands trembling," though some emotional transitions could be more contradictory rather than smoothly resolved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Valerius liberates both the marionette and himself, with visible cost in abandoning his knight identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mystical elements and symbolic gestures build toward the transformation, though the "Choose and complete" directive feels slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard with its "phosphorescent leaves" and "crystalline clearing" creates an effective dreamlike atmosphere that mirrors internal transformation. Setting actively constrains choice through the "impossible geometries" and guides action, though some descriptions lean toward generic fantasy rather than unique specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking possibility to confronting the queen's memory to choosing liberation over guilt, with clear cost in releasing his knight identity. The marionette's transformation and Valerius's parallel divestment create meaningful pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily after the single moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between marionette's binding and knight's armor, with the final image of walking "into the shifting, beautiful dark" offering resonant ambiguity. The concept of liberation through release rather than capture inverts expectations effectively, though "shape of possibility" occasionally feels abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated fantasy register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in descriptive passages like "threads of pure, solidified light." Some moments drift toward purple prose ("heartbreakingly familiar silhouette"), and dialogue is minimal, existing only as the whispered "Choose and complete."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("cascade of light that flowed into Valerius's chest") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some redundancy appears in emotional descriptions, and filter constructions like "He felt it more than saw it" diminish immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The marionette as metaphor for internal bondage offers a fresh angle on knight-redemption narratives, particularly the inversion where release rather than capture brings transformation. However, the mystical greenhouse setting and guilt-ridden knight are familiar fantasy elements that aren't fully transformed beyond their archetypal roots.</comment>
