I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore linkage where Elara's calculations lead to discovery, which enables choice, culminating in crossing the threshold.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her meticulous nature driving the quest. The internal contradiction between analytical control and artistic perception works well. However, the transformation at the end feels slightly unearned - we see her step through but don't feel the full weight of "trading her maps of the world for a key to its soul."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from midnight departure through discovery to threshold crossing. The closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (trading certainty for infinite mystery). The orientation is clear by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the cost being more stated than viscerally felt in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The starlit vault and infinite library effectively constrain and enable choices. Sensory details like "cold silk" membrane and "ozone and old paper" are specific and purposeful. The cracks forming arrows and the doors with keyhole escutcheons directly shape Elara's path and final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the fortress) is clear from the start. Escalation builds through environmental guidance, tool discovery, and door selection. However, the "dare" doesn't generate sufficient resistance - Elara moves forward with minimal internal struggle despite the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between mapped certainty and uncharted truth. The fortress as library of unspoken truths resonates without heavy-handedness. The final image of infinite shelves effectively reweights the opening's "measured lines and calculated probabilities."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "lattice of measured lines" matching Elara's analytical nature. POV is stable throughout. Some register elevation in places ("cathedral of quiet mystery") slightly strains the established voice but doesn't break it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate - most sentences advance the story. Minor issues with some elevated diction ("opaque wall," "basalt pedestal") and occasional redundancy ("trembling certainty" appears twice). The "somehow knew" construction weakens causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of physical navigation revealing metaphysical doors offers a fresh angle. The phantom train ticket punch as key is inventive. However, the execution leans on familiar portal fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation to elevate beyond competent genre work.</comment>
