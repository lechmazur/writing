I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore linkage where Elias's pursuit leads to discovery, which enables confession, which allows healing through laughter.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear (sister's trapped soul drives his unorthodox approach), and Thomas's fear of forgetting laughter creates genuine tension. However, Thomas appears late and his 73-year resistance dissolves too easily without dramatized struggle. The "modestly fearless" trait reads as label-only without visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Thomas's liberation through laughter integration, fulfilling the causal chain. The orientation is clean (soul collector in Echo Gorge pursuing child ghost). However, the resolution feels mechanically smooth - Thomas's decades of resistance evaporate after minimal conversation, undermining the promised 73-year challenge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's sonic distortions directly enable the pursuit mechanism through the misaligned harp. The crocodile's tooth translates vibrations into trackable melodies, making setting instrumental to plot. The hidden sunrise provides atmospheric pressure while the cave offers the intimate space needed for confession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared high (most challenging quarry, 73 years of resistance) but the actual confrontation lacks struggle. Thomas confesses immediately upon being asked his name, and his fear dissolves with two bell rings. No meaningful escalation occurs - the pursuit ends at first contact without adaptation or genuine resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The integration of laughter into healing emerges organically through Elias's personal tragedy and professional practice. The "luminous ache" between worlds resonates through specific details. However, the theme resolves too tidily - complex grief and decades of binding regret are solved through simple bell-ringing without earned transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with soul-collector lexicon ("spectral whispers," "luminous ache"). Dialogue feels natural, especially Thomas's childlike "I'm afraid I'll forget how to laugh." However, Elias's interiority tends toward abstract telling ("beautiful suffering between worlds") rather than embodied perception during pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly but suffers from overwriting in places ("pockets heavy with whispered regrets"). Some metaphors strain ("crystallizing in the air like visible joy"). The text loops concept-heavy phrases about suffering and healing without always advancing the narrative. Information density is moderate - several sentences restate rather than deepen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The soul collector premise offers fresh specificity through the crocodile's tooth amplifier and sonic tracking method. The integration of laughter as healing mechanism distinguishes this from standard ghost stories. However, the resolution follows expected beats without surprise - the resistant ghost confesses and ascends exactly as genre conventions predict.</comment>
