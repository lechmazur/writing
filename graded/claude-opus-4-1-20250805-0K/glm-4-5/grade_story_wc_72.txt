<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The statue's telepathic consciousness and the diver's internal journey are well-developed with clear motivations rooted in seeking understanding beyond certainty. However, the diver remains relatively passive, receiving wisdom rather than making difficult choices under pressure. The statue's "incisively kind" nature manifests through patient teaching, though its agency is limited to communication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with effective closure through Conceptual Repricing—the diver gains "better questions" rather than answers, reweighting the value of uncertainty. The revelations cascade effectively through telepathic visions. Cost is primarily conceptual (abandoning academic certainty) rather than viscerally felt, and the diver's transformation lacks a decisive on-page choice that would elevate the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting with bioluminescent corals and spectral visions effectively constrains the encounter and charges the final image. The ampoule's liquid expanding into memory-haze creates vivid sensory detail. The forgotten city's ruins mirror thematic complexity well, though some descriptions tend toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding versus certainty—develops through cascading revelations but lacks genuine pressure or risk. The diver faces no real opposition or cost beyond intellectual discomfort. While the internal conflict between academic belief and new knowledge creates some tension, there's no meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exceptional thematic coherence around certainty versus nuance, with the city's downfall serving as perfect metaphor for the dangers of absolute truth-seeking. The phrase "thread through the structural weakness of certainty" elegantly recurs with deepening meaning. The final image of "better questions" resonantly answers the central question without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, though the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spectral forms," "resonant satisfaction") that doesn't match the diving context. The statue's telepathic voice is effectively distinguished through formal diction. Some filter-verb accumulation ("watched as," "felt something") dulls immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues: "telepathic/telepathically" appears 8 times, "statue" 14 times, creating template cadence. Phrases like "the statue communicated," "the statue explained," "the statue continued" form repetitive stems. The prose achieves moments of beauty but suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly around the certainty/nuance theme being restated rather than developed through action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The telepathic statue as repository of lost civilization's wisdom offers a fresh angle on the mentor-figure trope. The concept of seeking "better questions" rather than answers provides genuine insight. However, the underwater lost city setting and the wisdom-through-ancient-artifact pattern are familiar, lacking the specific transformation that would elevate originality.</comment>
