<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation motif is well-established through physical changes after each hush. The discovery of the moonstone creates a genuine choice moment with visible cost (strengthening earth connections). However, interiority relies on abstract descriptions ("mossy delight," "familiar sensation") rather than embodied contradictions, and the character lacks meaningful internal conflict during her pivotal discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based transformation and seasonal ritual. The moonstone discovery creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights Elara's work from routine sorting to prophecy with higher stakes. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we're told about "changing winds" but don't see Elara pay a specific price for this knowledge or face what she must sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arbor setting actively constrains and enables Elara's work through its seasonal "hush" and responsive glow. Specific tools (bone tool, sorting tweezers) and sensory details (chlorophyll-stained fingers, mossy platform) ground the fantastical elements. The setting's agency peaks when the arbor "seemed to respond" to her concentration, though this could be more causally explicit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decoding prophecy for dwellers below) is established early but remains static until the moonstone appears. This discovery deepens the stakes by signaling "utmost importance," but the escalation is passive—Elara doesn't choose or sacrifice anything to earn this revelation. The warning about "changing winds" lacks specificity about what must be traded or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The transformation theme emerges through Elara's physical changes and the monuments to "forgotten things," creating resonance between preservation and change. The moonstone's appearance meaningfully reweights this pattern. However, the final message about "strengthening connection to the earth" reads as abstract thesis rather than earned wisdom from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent mythic register with controlled diction ("chlorophyll and pollen," "sacred sliver"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices seed varieties and arbor responses. However, several passages drift into elevated abstraction ("the hush where past meets prophecy") without grounding in her specific consciousness, and repetitive constructions ("always emerges transformed always") create awkward echoes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is reasonable though some passages loop concepts ("transformation beginning within her" appears twice with minimal variation). The phrase "always emerges transformed always" creates an awkward repetition, and abstract descriptors like "mossy delight" and "sacred folklore" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The seed-sorter-as-prophet concept offers a fresh angle on divination, and the monument-building method adds originality. The synthesis of botanical work with mystical purpose feels organic. The transformation through physical absorption of sorted materials is distinctive, though the prophecy content itself ("changing winds") falls into generic warning territory.</comment>
