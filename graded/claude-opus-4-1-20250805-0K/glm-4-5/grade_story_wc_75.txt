I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The guide's motivation to preserve dying arts and Khira's fierce resistance create clear, rooted drives that compel the closure choice. The "bread remembers" mantra and her defiant baking of initials embody internal conflict well. Minor deduction for the guide's somewhat passive role until the lens gift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase and pattern break (lens reveals dormant life, triggering thaw). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the bread/lens/baker combination reawakens cultural memory with visible cost (months of decline, lost daughter). The "spark igniting the long darkness" lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall with its bioluminescent fungi and damp walls creates atmospheric pressure. The baker's hollow and the bread-shaping details provide tactile specificity. Setting constrains choice through the bees' absence and the late thaw, directly shaping the crisis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on cultural extinction versus preservation, with the lens revelation creating a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge ("Movement... Like slow roots finding light"). The thaw beginning from the bread represents earned escalation. Cost is visible in Khira's lost daughter and the community's months of decline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bread-as-memory metaphor and the lens revealing hidden life force, avoiding direct statement. The final image of "vivid green of resilience" piercing "rosewater dread" offers a non-literal answer about cultural persistence through individual acts. Khira's song drawing the displaced persons creates resonant unity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains cultured, historically-oriented perspective with consistent elevated diction ("cavernous expanse," "hive-mind consciousness"). Khira's terse dialogue ("The bread remembers") contrasts effectively with the guide's genteel speech. Minor issues with occasional register elevation ("决心" appears to be an error).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("rosewater dread of a culture slowly eroding") but suffers from density issues in places. Some metaphor mixing ("swallowing the cavernous expanse"). The "决心" character insertion appears to be a technical error. Information density is generally good with purposeful description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The bread-shaped-like-initials as identity preservation offers a fresh angle on cultural memory. The emerald lens revealing dormant life force in starter dough is inventive. The synthesis of beekeeper absence, bread tradition, and lens technology creates non-obvious connections that feel earned.</comment>
