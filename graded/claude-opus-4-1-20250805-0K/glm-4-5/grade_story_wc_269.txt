<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, but her internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in scene. The final choice to continue recording lacks visible cost—she simply returns to routine after her revelation. The "tapping rhythms" gesture repeats without revealing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Marina's realization about Earth's cycles serving as closure through Conceptual Repricing. However, the cost remains purely conceptual without visible stakes—Marina faces no trade-off or foreclosed path when accepting her witness role. The revelation about "paths disappearing" arrives through internal reflection rather than dramatized discovery despite the torn atlas setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station and ocean setting effectively frame Marina's isolation and observation role. Sensory details like "saltwater tears" and "watercolors left in the rain" create atmosphere. However, the environment doesn't constrain Marina's choices—the station merely provides a vantage point rather than shaping her decisions or creating obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—remains intellectual throughout without escalating pressure. Marina's discovery unfolds through passive data comparison rather than active conflict. No meaningful tightening occurs; she begins observing and ends observing, with the revelation creating no visible change in her circumstances or forcing any trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of planetary cycles reclaiming human intervention emerges effectively through the torn atlas and rising seas imagery. The concept of "periodically eternal" cycles resonates through coral bleaching and recovery patterns. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("their time had passed in the great cycle") rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's scientific perspective shapes the narration with appropriate technical vocabulary and observational precision. The rhythm of "tapping" creates a consistent motif tied to her processing style. Some passages drift into elevated register ("sentinel," "ancient rhythms") that doesn't fully align with Marina's practical scientist voice, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful repetition of the tapping motif. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "paths—both physical and metaphorical—disappeared" restates the torn atlas discovery; "drifting, disconnected" and later "drifting and moored" repeat without advancement. The final paragraph contains excessive abstract summary about planetary cycles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The monitoring station post-climate crisis offers a specific angle, and linking coral bleaching to childhood trauma provides character grounding. However, the resolution—scientist realizes nature has cycles—feels predictable without transformation. The story doesn't risk bold choices, settling for contemplative observation over dramatic stakes.</comment>
