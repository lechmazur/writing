I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like mixing powders and tracing the journal, with internal conflict between preservation duty and obsolescence anxiety. However, the emotional progression relies on stated abstractions ("haunted euphoria," "weight of small moments") rather than fully dramatized struggle, and the wife's death serves as convenient emotional ballast without earning its centrality to his choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the archivist's final night of analog preservation before digital transition, but the closure lacks decisive change—he simply walks away after completing his ritual. The "regenerated covenant" concept remains abstract philosophy rather than dramatized transformation, and while atmospheric pressure builds, no clear cost lands on the page beyond accepting inevitable change that was already decided off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty with wildflowers pushing through weathered planks creates vivid sensory grounding, and the walnut-ink solution's amber glow provides tactile specificity. Setting actively participates through the flowers becoming ingredients for his final preservation act, though the archive itself remains vague and the transition between jetty and interior workspace isn't clearly anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving analog craft before digital transition—is signaled early but faces no real opposition or complication, as the digitization is already decided and the archivist simply performs his ritual unopposed. The conflict remains entirely internal and philosophical without external pressure forcing difficult choices, and the resolution requires no sacrifice beyond accepting predetermined change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus progress emerges through concrete details like the walnut-ink formula and blooming jetty, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the "weight of small moments" philosophy gets stated repeatedly rather than demonstrated through accumulating particulars, and the final image of walking toward "whatever new context awaited" offers resignation rather than resonant transformation of the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with appropriate lexicon for an archivist ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant"), and perception filters through his preservationist lens. However, the voice leans heavily on abstract philosophical statements and repetitive constructions ("haunted euphoria" appears three times), lacking the rhythmic modulation and syntactic variety needed to heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "weight of small moments" concepts repeat without advancement, and phrases like "haunted euphoria" recur identically. The prose achieves moments of clarity ("wildflowers of violet and crimson poked through weathered wooden planks") but suffers from abstract philosophizing that replaces concrete action, particularly in the middle sections where reflection dominates scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist facing digital obsolescence offers a specific angle on preservation versus progress, and the jetty setting with regenerative flower-ink formula provides fresh detail. However, the emotional arc follows predictable beats of nostalgic acceptance without surprising turns, and the resolution chooses the safest middle path of graceful resignation rather than bold stance.</comment>
