<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation to name nameless fears after losing Elara is clear and consistent, driving his actions throughout. Internal conflict between eternal duty and mortal love creates genuine tension. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and "heartbroken reaper" relies on archetype without sufficient embodied particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through naming acts that crystallize fears. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the reaper transforms from collector to namer, with emotional cost visible in "cloak no longer seemed as heavy." Orientation anchors (reaper, observatory, dusk) establish cleanly within first lines. The piece teaches its naming-as-healing pattern early and pays it off, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory functions as more than backdrop—its "cracked glass panels" create the scattered light essential to the crystallization process, and the "central mechanism" provides tactile interaction. Sensory details like "voice like dry leaves skittering" effectively characterize the reaper. The atlas page and astrolabe recordings constrain choices and enable the naming ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming grief through naming, with clear escalation from personal pain ("Solitude") to cosmic understanding ("Lost Hope," "Elara's Eyes"). The naming acts progressively deepen, moving from internal ache to external monsters to celestial bodies. Cost is legible in the centuries of carried pain and the sacrifice of letting go, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the naming conceit—making the terrifying manageable through language. The traveling poet's wisdom about crystallization provides earned insight rather than platitude. Final image of the observatory holding "names for the future" resonates without moralizing. The piece avoids tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence about transformation through understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with consistent death-imagery ("skeletal hands," "dry leaves," "shadows made solid") that matches the reaper POV. Dialogue serves multiple functions—Elara's "The stars remember what we forget" both characterizes and foreshadows. The poet's line about crystallization advances plot while maintaining naturalistic delivery. Perceptual signature remains death-focused throughout without becoming monotonous.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears ("shadows made solid," "echo of sacrifice resonated") but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere. Template phrases like "For the first time in centuries" and "Somewhere in the realm between worlds" reduce originality but don't harm closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a death-figure seeking to name rather than collect souls offers genuine freshness. Specific details like naming sea monsters "Lost Hope" and stars "Elara's Eyes" transform the grief narrative beyond generic heartbreak. The synthesis of cartographic terror, astronomical observation, and linguistic crystallization creates an original constellation. Risk-taking in making Death vulnerable pays off thematically.</comment>
