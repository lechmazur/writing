I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation feels generic ("salvage something pure") and her ghost-whispering ability operates through convenient exposition rather than embodied struggle. The captain's sacrifice and the survivors' betrayal create clear stakes, but Elara herself lacks internal contradiction or meaningful cost in her choices. Her resolution method (dream visitations) unfolds without personal risk or visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Elara simply places the globe back after completing her task without transformation. The orientation anchors arrive late (wreck-diver and ghost whisperer roles unclear until told). The revelation about insurance fraud creates plot movement but Elara's own arc shows no meaningful change or price paid for her intervention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and underwater wreck provide atmospheric anchors, with the "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" offering vivid specificity. However, neither setting constrains choices or creates pressure—Elara moves freely between environments without obstacle. The melted snow globe's warmth despite ocean chill suggests magical properties but this detail doesn't affect tactics or outcomes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (exposing truth about the shipwreck) develops through discovery rather than escalating pressure. Elara faces no opposition or meaningful obstacles—she finds the globe easily, connects with spirits smoothly, and delivers truth without resistance. The story tells us about "weaving truth carefully" but shows no actual difficulty or trade-offs in this process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging purity from tragedy emerges clearly but relies on explicit statements ("salvage something pure from the wreckage" repeated twice). The contrast between the captain's sacrifice and the crew's betrayal offers moral complexity, but Elara's intervention feels consequence-free. The final image of the clear snow globe suggests resolution but lacks the resonant ambiguity that would elevate theme beyond surface morality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through a specific ghost-whisperer's lens. Phrases like "borrowed starlight" appear three times without earning their repetition through varied meaning. The narrative voice tends toward explanation over embodiment, particularly when describing supernatural abilities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "salvage something pure from the wreckage" appears verbatim twice, "windows of connection" repeats four times without evolution. Template phrasing pervades action sequences ("Elara descended," "Elara closed her eyes," "Elara knew," "Elara returned," "Elara smiled," "Elara placed"). The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("precious cargo and even more precious lives") rather than concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The ghost-whisperer wreck-diver combination offers surface novelty but executes through familiar paranormal investigation tropes. The insurance fraud revelation follows predictable patterns without surprising inflection. The story's resolution—gentle dream revelations leading descendants to confess—chooses the safest, most morally tidy path without exploring darker possibilities of justice or revenge.</comment>
