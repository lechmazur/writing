<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza's unusual motivation (capturing "the sound of trust breaking") creates genuine character particularity, with her methodical false starts showing tactical intelligence under pressure. The inherited moonshine runner legacy and watch fob belief system establish consistent traits that drive her manipulative choices through to the successful capture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain through Eliza's calculated deceptions to break the truce, with each false start building toward the final betrayal between Malachi and his lieutenant. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she captures the "sound" in the watch fob, though the conceptual cost of destroyed trust could be more viscerally felt rather than observed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier creates atmospheric pressure with its "creaking wood and hushed negotiations," while the watch fob functions as both key and recording device. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tavern corner to rum barrels to back room, with the dawn deadline adding temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Eliza's three attempts—from the failed approach to the burly pirate, through planting suspicion with the second-in-command, to the final calculated lie about patrol schedules. The truce breaking carries immediate consequence (first shot fired), though Eliza's personal risk remains somewhat abstract beyond achieving her strange goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of "trust as sound" creates thematic resonance, with the watch fob literally capturing what normally exists only as metaphor. The final image of Eliza possessing "this moment that no one else could perceive" offers a non-literal answer about the nature of betrayal's intangibility made tangible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent control with phrases like "the comforting unease of the market settled around her like a familiar cloak," though some passages lean toward explanatory summary. The perceptual signature of someone attuned to criminal undercurrents comes through in her observation of "suspicion in his step."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and atmospheric details like "slipping through her fingers like the damp sea air." Some expository passages ("This time, the seed took root") could trust more in dramatization, and occasional template phrases ("As expected," "But it wasn't enough") create minor momentum drags.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of recording trust's destruction as sound offers genuine originality, transforming a heist/betrayal story through this specific obsession. The moonshine runner's daughter inheriting criminal skills but pursuing something "far stranger" than profit creates memorable character specificity.</comment>
