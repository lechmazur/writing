grade_story_wc_85.txt
I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern and repetition of memory/forgetting motifs, with density increases around truth/fabrication that reweight Martin's understanding of his past.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Martin's guilt and internal conflict are well-embodied through physical details (tracing watch hand, rising bile, trembling fingers). The revelation about his grandfather's unconditional love provides earned motivation for change, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("layers of deception he had carefully constructed around his heart").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Martin discovers his grandfather's carving, reweighting his entire career of erasure. However, the cost feels more declared than visceral - we're told about tears and reconciliation but don't feel the weight of years lost. The accumulative lens holds but the final transformation happens too smoothly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore create atmospheric pressure, with driftwood carvings functioning as both setting and constraint for Martin's search. The watch hand and carved duplicate effectively charge the final revelation, though some descriptions remain generic ("weathered stone steps").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake - Martin's need to confront his erased past - builds through accumulation of guilt and searching. The discovery provides one meaningful deepening, but escalation relies heavily on internal reflection rather than present-scene pressure, limiting tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of manufactured versus authentic memory emerges through concrete particulars (falsified family trees, driftwood carvings). The ending offers resonance through the paired objects, though the final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("sometimes the most valuable inheritance...") undermines subtlety with direct thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on craftsmanship details and memory. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("temple of his trade," "empire on the shifting sands") that feels disconnected from Martin's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Martin + verb" construction dominates) and abstract metaphors that blur clarity ("sieved hush," "temple of trade"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly around Martin's profession being explained multiple times. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing particularly damages line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The black market genealogist premise offers originality, and the grandfather's matching carving provides a specific reversal. However, the emotional arc follows predictable redemption patterns, and the transformation from corrupt to reformed happens without exploring messier middle ground.</comment>
