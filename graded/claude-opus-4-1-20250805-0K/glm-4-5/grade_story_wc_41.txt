<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices, particularly in his determination to remember before forgetting. The final moment of "committing the sound to memory one last time before it slipped away" shows earned acceptance of his condition's cost. However, the caretaker remains underdeveloped beyond her functional role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the prophet finally hears and accepts the ephemeral "sound of growing older" before it fades—a moment of Charged Poise that crystallizes his lifelong search with visible emotional cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as fog, driftwood markers, and chalk drawings build toward this sonic revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden functions as more than backdrop—visibility constraints force the driftwood navigation system, and the grandmother's arch becomes the essential vessel for the sought sound. Sensory detail effectively narrows to sound and touch under the fog's obscuring pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from abstract searching to concrete discovery when the chalk drawing activates the arch's captured echoes. The prophet's choice to complete the pattern despite knowing he'll forget shows agency with cost. However, the caretaker's convenient appearance and departure weakens the earned quality of resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central metaphor of capturing/losing the "sound of growing older" resonates beyond its literal frame, with the videotapes providing effective contrast between preserved youth and lived aging. The final image of returning to arrange markers after achieving/losing his goal offers genuine complexity without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with effective modulation—"tidal longing" and "fog swirled around his ankles" establish texture without overwriting. The prophet's dialogue stays spare and oblique ("I'm just someone looking for something"). Minor strain appears in phrases like "precognitively forgetful" that feel more authorial than character-rooted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and selective detail, though some figurative language borders on overwrought ("ships in a misty harbor"). The filter-verb cluster around memories ("He remembered back to") and slight redundancy in the ending (turning to arrange markers again) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a "precognitively forgetful" prophet searching for an abstract sound offers genuine freshness, executed through specific sensory work rather than gimmick. The synthesis of junkyard setting with ephemeral sound-hunting creates non-obvious resonance.</comment>
