<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kai's trauma responses are embodied through sweat, tremors, and physical collapse, but the mathematical epiphany about mercy arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle. The proprioceptive enhancement creates interesting sensory detail yet doesn't generate meaningful internal contradiction or force difficult choices. Final realization feels unearned despite visceral opening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The story attempts Accumulative/Textural progression through sensory layering and trauma echoes, but closure arrives as abstract insight ("mercy was a function of time over pain") without visible cost or foreclosed path. The mathematical framework discovery lacks concrete stakes or demonstrable change in Kai's options. Orientation anchors clearly but the conceptual repricing doesn't land with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest creates a distinctive sensory environment that mirrors Kai's internal state, with glowing bark and peculiar light spectrum. The pewter mask strap functions as both physical object and mathematical key. However, the forest doesn't meaningfully constrain choices beyond providing atmospheric reflection of trauma.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Internal conflict centers on processing trauma memories, but no external pressure forces escalation or meaningful choice. The "discovery" of mercy's mathematics arrives without opposition or cost—Kai simply realizes it while examining the mask strap. No tightening of options or foreclosed paths despite elaborate setup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of quantifying mercy emerges through Kai's search for "mathematics of mercy" and the forest as space for "ultraviolet penance." The final insight attempts conceptual repricing but lands as abstract philosophy ("mercy was a function of time over pain") rather than earned wisdom from dramatized struggle. Pattern of mathematical/algorithmic imagery coheres without achieving resonant closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV maintains consistency through Kai's trauma-filtered perception, with proprioceptive awareness creating distinctive sensory signature. However, register drifts into clinical abstraction ("systematic deconstruction of his humanity," "proprioceptively enhanced senses mapping") that clashes with embodied trauma state. Voice loses specificity in philosophical passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "Kai" appears as sentence subject 11 times; "proprioceptive" variants repeat without advancing meaning. Abstract philosophical statements ("mercy had no mathematics," "mathematics of mercy") create loops rather than progression. Template cadence in "He/His" openings across multiple paragraphs dulls propulsion despite some vivid sensory moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of discovering mercy's mathematical equation through trauma-enhanced perception offers conceptual freshness. The ultraviolet forest as externalized trauma space shows originality. However, execution relies on abstract philosophizing rather than grounded dramatic revelation, and the mathematical insight arrives without earned specificity.</comment>
