I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered discoveries and transformations rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of Maven's understanding of "home."

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maven's motivation is clear and her transformation earned through the stone's discovery and nightly rituals. The internal journey from lost searcher to one who "carried home within her" tracks well. However, the epiphany about "substituting reality nightly" arrives too suddenly without prior embodied hints, and emotional states remain somewhat abstract ("overwhelmed," "lost") rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maven discovers home is "not a place at all, but the connections between places." The accumulative structure builds through stone discovery, feather texture, and nightly rituals to this crystallized understanding with clear cost (years of searching). The orientation anchors early and the textural lens holds, though the "substituting reality" revelation feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain setting directly constrains and enables Maven's journey—the labyrinthine corridors mirror her internal search, and the feather's texture literally reshapes space. Sensory details like "scent of aging paper and leather" and "mercury glass...like a shield" create atmosphere while the mountain's "hidden thunder" charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding "the shape of home"—is signaled early and deepens through Maven's discoveries. The stone and feather escalate her abilities, forcing her to confront dormant talents. The resolution lands with earned cost (years of searching transformed into understanding), though middle escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of home as connection rather than place emerges organically through Maven's journey. The mercury glass, lost language stone, and feather accumulate meaning without heavy-handed symbolism. The final revelation that "home shaped itself around those who learned to see beyond the surface" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior searching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent mythic-literary register appropriate to the seer protagonist, with phrases like "mercury-glass seer" and "labyrinthine corridors" establishing tone. However, some passages drift into elevated abstraction ("the intersection of all stories ever told") that slightly distances from Maven's immediate experience, and dialogue absence limits voice distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structures and maintains momentum, but suffers from abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy: "revelation struck Maven with the force of a blow" and "growing understanding" are telling rather than showing. Several paraphrase loops appear ("searching for something she couldn't name"/"to understand the shape of home"). The "hidden thunder" repetition works as pattern but some figurative language feels forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a bookstore-mountain containing "the doorway between all homes" offers fresh perspective on the search-for-belonging trope. The lost language stone and reality-substitution abilities create original texture. However, the transformation follows somewhat predictable beats, and the resolution, while resonant, doesn't fully surprise.</comment>
