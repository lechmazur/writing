I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and resonant details toward a final crystallization of the keeper's purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" drives consistent choices throughout, from activating the origami swan to resisting the silence's "tempting stasis." The internal tension between recording and being absorbed creates genuine stakes. Minor deduction for the keeper's somewhat abstract characterization beyond their role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper returns bearing "the fragile, regenerative silence a secret etched onto their soul and their stones." The cost is legible—resisting stasis requires active anchoring through their "loose grip on reality." The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization of purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge and overgrown library create distinct atmospheric zones that constrain choices—the keeper must use the origami swan to navigate between them. The "regenerative silence" space functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the keeper's decision to witness but not succumb. Sensory details like "solidified honey" and "ozone and ancient paper" are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing without being absorbed—intensifies when the keeper encounters the silence's "tempting stasis." The tension between preservation and entropy deepens through the journey, with the keeper's "loose grip on reality" becoming both vulnerability and tool. Cost is visible in the active resistance required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between entropy and preservation, with the keeper embodying the paradox of recording change while remaining unchanged. The final image of "the refuge held, the crumbled library sighed above" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's established dichotomy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct narrative texture with phrases like "drift of untold seasons" and "fractured sunlight" creating a timeless, contemplative register. Some elevated diction ("impermeable silence," "entropy's inevitable advance") occasionally strains against immediacy but serves the chronicle-keeper's detached perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("profound quiet," "active, presence-filled void") and some redundancy ("silent observer," "steadily, silently"). The phrase "cryptic folds" appears twice. Information density is moderate; some sentences could do more work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The origami swan as dimensional key offers a fresh take on passage between spaces, and the concept of "regenerative silence" that preserves while the world decays provides an original tension. The chronicle keeper's role transforms the observer trope through specific cost—they must resist absorption to fulfill their purpose.</comment>
