<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a truth-seeker is consistent and drives her investigation, but her internal complexity remains thin—she experiences determination and hope without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to become "keeper of this truth" lacks visible personal cost beyond general risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story reaches Charged Poise—Maya stands ready to act with crystallized options—but the cost remains abstract ("fate worse than liquidation") rather than felt on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about the stillpoint accumulate toward Maya's realization, though the closure lacks a decisive present-tense action that would strengthen the before/after shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard with its "impossibly perfect" fruit and glowing soil creates atmospheric tension, and the flawed diamond functions as micro-setting that enables Maya's discovery. However, the environment doesn't constrain her final choice—she could make the same decision anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating an anomaly to uncovering a corporate conspiracy about dimensional energy, but Maya faces no concrete opposition or immediate pressure forcing her choice. The "radioactive dust storm" arrives but doesn't test her commitment or exact a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges through Maya's investigation, but the final paragraphs drift into abstract declarations ("Hope was the one thing the corporations couldn't liquidate"). The stillpoint concept offers resonance but lacks the specific embodiment that would charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, and Maya's "sharply observant" nature colors perception adequately. However, the prose lacks distinct texture—phrases like "relentless pursuit of truth" and "comfortable lies" feel generic rather than voice-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Template cadence weakens momentum ("Maya traced...," "Maya felt...," "Maya refused...," "Maya touched..."), and abstract declarations replace concrete imagery in the final third. The phrase "sharply observant" appears four times without variation, creating repetitive stems that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept and dimensional energy filtering radiation into life offers a moderately fresh angle on post-apocalyptic recovery. However, the conspiracy-debunker-uncovers-corporate-secrets framework follows familiar templates without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
