<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and his transformation from observer to participant in narrative magnetism is earned through the donor heart catalyst. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract musings ("iridescent caution," "quietly explosive") rather than embodied emotional states, and the final choice to serve tea lacks visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kaelen's discovery building through observation and experimentation to a Conceptual Repricing about narrative magnetism. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Kaelen's realization changes his understanding but doesn't foreclose options or exact a price. The orientation is clear but the piece reads more as extended reflection than scene with pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house setting is vivid and specific, constraining access via rope ladder and enabling Kaelen's light experiments through strategic prisms. Sensory details like "flour-dusted anecdotes" and the morpho wing's color shifts are well-integrated. The setting directly enables the discovery through its design for tracking light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding narrative magnetism—is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure or meaningful obstacles. Kaelen's research proceeds smoothly from observation to discovery without setbacks or costs. The "quietly explosive" realization arrives without forcing trade-offs or foreclosing paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of perspective-dependent truth emerges organically through the morpho wing metaphor and Kaelen's discovery about iridescent storytelling. The concept that stories magnetize through shifting perspectives is specific and avoids moralizing. However, the insight feels more intellectual than emotionally earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with phrases like "valley-mist wonder" and selective perception focused on light and color. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("narrative magnetism," "iridescent caution") that doesn't fully match a dye master's lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of beauty ("tea house anchored to a single massive rock") but suffers from abstract loops around concepts like "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" without concrete embodiment. Template cadence appears in "he would rise...he would serve" constructions. Information density is moderate with some passages restating rather than advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise of a dye master studying narrative magnetism through color perception post-transplant offers a fresh angle. The synthesis of craft knowledge with metaphysical inquiry feels specific. However, the resolution—that stories magnetize through perspective shifts—while thoughtful, doesn't transform the familiar concept enough to feel revelatory.</comment>
