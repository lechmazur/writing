<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's yearning for transformation drives consistent choices through finding the scrimshaw to her final dissolution, with embodied emotion ("trembling fingers," "heart a battlefield"). The transformation from dock worker to one who embraces her true nature lands with visible cost—losing her former self and physical existence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("great emptiness in her chest") and the convenience of the scrimshaw appearing exactly when needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through scrimshaw discovery, emerging text, whale calls, and final dissolution—each layer reweighting Mara's relationship to her constrained life. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara's transformation into the disappearing island resident forecloses her shore-bound life with clear cost: "the other dock workers would speak for years of the morning Mara vanished." The pattern of revelation-through-discovery maintains causality under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe setting constrains choices effectively—Mara can only find the scrimshaw through her dock work, and the liminal water/land space mirrors her transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("golden light spilled across water the color of mercury"). The disappearing island functions as both setting and destination, charging the final image of dissolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: finding scrimshaw → text emerging → whale call → ritual → transformation, each narrowing Mara's path toward irreversible change. The cost is legible in her loss of physical form and separation from the known world. Minor deduction for the convenience of the whale's timing and the somewhat abstract nature of internal barriers dissolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of authentic self-realization emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, with the scrimshaw "unlocking guarded hearts" literalized through Mara's transformation. The final image of being "welcomed home" to one's true nature resonates without moralizing. The recurring water/dissolution imagery effectively reweights from constraint to liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception filtered through Mara's yearning ("water the color of mercury," "fragments of liquid moonlight"). Some elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "perpetual dance") fits the mythic tone but occasionally distances. The perceptual signature of noticing grace in mundane dock work effectively characterizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("pieces of scrimshaw began to detach, floating before her like fragments of liquid moonlight") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("great emptiness," "barriers within herself") and some redundancy in describing transformation stages. Template phrasing appears in emotional description ("heart a battlefield of hope and fear"). Information density is moderate; several sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of dock worker finding mystical artifact freshens through specific execution—the scrimshaw revealing text over time, pieces detaching to mirror internal dissolution. The "combative tenderness" of yearning for the impossible offers psychological complexity. The vanishing island as destination for true self-expression transforms the escape trope through its requirement of complete dissolution.</comment>
