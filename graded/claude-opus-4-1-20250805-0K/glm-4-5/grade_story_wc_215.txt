<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The recluse's transformation from isolated observer to active keeper of the covenant shows clear motivation rooted in their "tranquilly perceptive" nature, with the final choice to preserve silence carrying visible cost. Internal conflict between understanding the spirits and maintaining the covenant's requirements creates genuine tension. However, the character lacks embodied emotional specificity in crisis moments, relying on abstract descriptors like "astonished" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the recluse becomes the covenant's keeper, with visible cost in accepting eternal silence and teaching others this restraint. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as silence and unspoken communication build density toward the final transformation. The covenant's requirement revelation and box opening create meaningful tightening that forecloses speech as an option. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how other survivors suddenly understand without words at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned apiary with its "cracked glass domes" and "twisted acacia trees" creates vivid sensory grounding that constrains choices—the recluse must navigate among ghosts and interpret hive markings. The stained glass box's "impossible colors" and warmth provide tactile specificity that charges the final image. Setting evolution from discovery to covenant-keeping space tracks cleanly. Slightly generic "scorched wasteland" and limited sensory range beyond visual hold it back from higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Central stake of understanding/preserving the covenant deepens meaningfully when the box's requirement is revealed—"listened more than they had spoken"—forcing the recluse to choose silence. The anniversary timing creates natural pressure for the opening ritual. Cost is visible when the recluse accepts their role as eternal keeper. However, escalation relies heavily on discovery rather than active choice until the final third, and the golden bee's dissolution lacks clear causal weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence holding more truth than speech emerges organically through the covenant's requirements and the recluse's transformation into its keeper. The "weight of unspoken words" gains layers through specific examples—unvoiced apologies, unexpressed gratitude, unconfessed love. The final image of ghostly smiles suggesting approval offers resonant non-literal answer to whether silence can preserve meaning. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract handling of how silence operates as preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("moonlight spilled across the scorched wasteland") and controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery moments. The perceptual signature of noticing spirit behaviors and glass imagery shows character-specific observation. Clean free indirect style maintains consistent psychic distance. However, some register elevation ("mute eloquence," "tangible manifestation") occasionally drifts from the established voice, and dialogue absence means no test of voice distinction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful variety in sentence structure and paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm. Strong moments like "releasing a single golden bee that circled three times before dissolving into moon-bleached air" show precise imagery. However, repetitive phrase patterns appear ("Through contextual clues" used three times, "astonished recluse" repeated), and some abstract phrasing ("tangible manifestation of a tangled covenant") lacks concrete specificity. Template cadence in middle sections dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with beekeeping and ghost visibility creates non-obvious angle on communication and loss. The covenant concept requiring silence over speech inverts typical revelation narratives. Specific details like the stained glass box that "grew warm in their hands whenever silence stretched" show originality. However, the ghost-visibility premise and wise recluse archetype, while transformed, still echo familiar templates without fully breaking free.</comment>
