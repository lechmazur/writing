<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's blindness creates genuine constraints that shape his unique diagnostic method, and his relationship with the apprentice drives the repair choice with emotional stakes. The character avoids inspiration-porn tropes through specific competence balanced with "steadier hands than yesterday" vulnerability. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("heartfelt artisan") and the convenient timing of the drone's arrival.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's repair reconnects teacher and student across distance with visible cost (the apprentice's departure). The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains causality throughout. Deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution and limited escalation of pressure beyond the initial problem-solution arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot creates atmospheric coherence while the water-refraction diagnostic method provides unique sensory detail that shapes Elias's work process. Setting constrains choice through Elias's blindness requiring the specific light/water technique. Minor deduction for some generic atmospheric description ("ethereal silence") that doesn't fully leverage the industrial depot specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining connection despite separation—is signaled early and deepens through the repair act. Pressure exists but doesn't significantly escalate; the repair proceeds smoothly without meaningful complications or reversals. The cost (separation) is established but not intensified through the action, limiting the escalation under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of repair as metaphor for maintaining human connections across distance. The water-refraction diagnosis creates a resonant image of seeing differently, though this could be pushed further. The ending achieves thematic closure without explicit moralizing but doesn't fully exploit the complexity available in the blindness/sight paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elias's non-visual senses and technical expertise. The prose effectively modulates between technical precision and emotional resonance. Minor deductions for occasional elevated diction ("ethereal silence," "vulnerable nerves") that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Several instances of overwriting ("ethereal silence," "vulnerable nerves," "ballet in miniature") and some redundancy in describing the mist's presence. The water-refraction passage achieves good clarity but occasional purple prose touches ("iridescent wings bent at unnatural angles") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blind artisan using light refraction for diagnosis offers genuine originality, avoiding typical blind-character tropes. The synthesis of industrial setting with delicate craft work creates freshness. Deduction for somewhat predictable emotional arc and the convenience of the resolution's timing.</comment>
