<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in revolutionary purpose, with embodied tension in the warm bronze quill holder against his ribs and measured movements under pressure. The character's internal calm contrasts effectively with external tension, though deeper contradictory impulses during the sundial scene would strengthen the arc. His final stance crystallizes with visible cost—the risk of discovery and execution—earned through consistent revolutionary commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: blackout enables secret communication → Elias completes coded message → revolutionaries receive gathering coordinates. Closure lands as Charged Poise with Elias resuming his sentinel post while "embers of revolution began to glow," the cost felt in the dangerous double life he maintains. Orientation anchors effectively (vigilant lock sentinel, luminous fort, twilight) though the Chinese character "联络" disrupts otherwise clean causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous fort's bioluminescent walls and half-painted sundial effectively constrain choices—the blackout creates the necessary darkness for secret communication, while the sundial serves as both timepiece and covert message board. Sensory details like "elongated shadows where none should exist" and the bronze quill holder's changing temperature enhance atmosphere. The setting directly enables the revolutionary plot, though more specific architectural details would strengthen spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmitting revolutionary coordinates without detection—escalates through the blackout opportunity, the guard's interruption forcing Elias to pause his work, and the Keeper's confirmation adding time pressure before power returns. Agency manifests in Elias's decision to complete the message despite surveillance risk. The tightening occurs when power restoration threatens to expose the incomplete sundial, forcing rapid completion with visible cost in maintained deception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between oppressive surveillance and artistic resistance, with the sundial serving as both functional tool and revolutionary symbol. The "cradle of sparks" metaphor effectively captures quiet revolution spreading "from heart to heart" rather than through violence. The final image of Elias as sentinel while revolution glows beneath resonates without stating a moral, though the theme could deepen through more specific counter-readings of the artistic deception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal register appropriate to Elias's sentinel role, with controlled perception reflecting his vigilant nature. The Chinese character "联络" appears to be an error rather than intentional code, disrupting voice coherence. Dialogue between Elias and the Keeper carries appropriate subtext about their conspiracy, though more distinct speech patterns would strengthen characterization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates solid clarity with purposeful repetition of "bronze quill holder" and "vigilant lock sentinel" creating rhythm. The Chinese character "联络" (meaning "contact/liaison") appears to be an artifact that breaks the English text flow. Some phrases like "winking hush" feel forced, and occasional overwriting ("wan glow," "tangible reminder") slightly dampens momentum, though information density remains adequate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of revolutionary messages hidden in sundial art offers a fresh angle on resistance narrative, with the blackout-as-opportunity adding specificity. The synthesis of art, timekeeping, and coded communication feels organic to the world. While the oppressive surveillance state is familiar territory, the particular method of resistance through angular measurements and pigments provides moderate originality.</comment>
