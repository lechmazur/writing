I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore chain where Maya's discovery of her true identity leads to her hiding, decrypting clues, and confronting her pursuers.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's transformation from controlled stunt double to embracing vulnerability lands with earned causality. The phobias (claustrophobia/cleithrophobia) create genuine internal conflict during the library hiding scene. However, the revelation about her billionaire father feels somewhat convenient, and the final epiphany about "vulnerability as power" arrives through assertion rather than fully dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Charged Poise closure - Maya faces her pursuers with newfound understanding, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The causal chain holds (betrayal→hiding→decryption→confrontation), but the orientation wobbles initially with dense backstory dumps. The "who you thought" timeframe and Maya's exact relationship to Thorne could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rusted library with broken skylight and phosphorescent starlight creates atmospheric pressure for Maya's hiding. However, setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint on choices. The decaying books forming "protective barriers" and the restricted section work functionally but don't meaningfully alter tactics beyond providing hiding spots.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis to survival against The Production, with the approaching midnight deadline adding pressure. However, the conflict resolution relies heavily on Maya's internal realization rather than dramatized struggle. The Production remains vague as antagonists, and Maya's "outwitting" happens through emotional acceptance rather than concrete action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vulnerability-as-power theme emerges through Maya's journey from controlled professional to accepting her authentic self. The seashell's whispers and the recurring motif of hidden truth support this adequately. However, the theme sometimes announces itself too directly ("Vulnerability is power" stated as mantra), and the final revelation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains Maya's perspective consistently with appropriate psychic distance for her emotional state. Phrases like "heart-pounding fear" and "trembling certainty" align with character stress. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal patterns," "unstoppable power of absolute truth") that doesn't fully match a panicked stunt double's immediate thoughts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Maya had always been...", "Maya adjusted...", "Maya pressed...") and overreliance on abstract declarations. Phrases like "unstoppable power of absolute truth" and "transformative betrayal" lean heavily on telling over showing. The story also loops the vulnerability-as-power concept multiple times without adding pressure. Some mixed metaphors appear (seashell "whispering" but also growing "warmer").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The stunt-double-as-secret-heiress premise follows familiar patterns, though the phobia angle adds modest distinction. The specific combination of claustrophobia/cleithrophobia for someone in Maya's profession shows thought. However, the resolution through self-acceptance and "vulnerability as power" lands in expected territory without surprising transformation of the core betrayal concept.</comment>
