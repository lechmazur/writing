<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to honor collective grief through stone carving is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during key moments. The "fiercely meditative" state is labeled rather than shown through specific physical or mental cost. His transformation from individual to collective understanding happens too smoothly without dramatized resistance or genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through butterfly migration and ribbon knotting patterns. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the completed monument transforms grief from individual to collective, with villagers experiencing "thundering calm before it." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see the transformation but not what Elias sacrifices to achieve it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with ancient glass panes and butterfly migration creates atmospheric texture but doesn't meaningfully constrain Elias's choices. Sensory detail focuses heavily on visual (dust motes, amber wings) while neglecting other senses during tactile work. The garden paths and stone bench exist as locations rather than spaces that pressure decisions or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "the shape of collective grief"—is signaled early but develops through accumulation rather than escalating pressure. The butterflies' arrival and ribbon-knotting create textural deepening consistent with the lens, but no meaningful tightening occurs that forecloses options. The spectral mentor's presence adds atmosphere without creating genuine opposition or forcing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of individual versus collective grief emerges through the butterfly migration metaphor and culminates in the monument that "absorb[s] not mourn individual loss but to honor the collective shape of human grief." The mentor's words about transformation resonate at closure, though the insight arrives somewhat abstractly. The final image of butterflies as "fragile yet endless journey across generations" offers non-literal resonance without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and meditative tone appropriate to Elias's craft, with rhythmic control in phrases like "thundering calm" and "fiercely meditative focus." However, perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—Elias notices what any gravestone carver might notice. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unsettled spirits," "ancient rhythm") that feels writerly rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("spectral mentor" appears 6 times, "woven ribbon" 5 times without variation). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Elias pressed...Elias prepared...Elias closed his eyes...Elias decided"). The typo "Thecompleted" and awkward phrasing "drawn by rumors of its power to absorb not mourn" indicate proofreading gaps that touch important beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of a gravestone carver discovering collective grief through butterfly migration patterns offers a fresh synthesis of death work and natural cycles. The spectral mentorship adds mystical texture without falling into cliché. However, the execution remains somewhat abstract—the specific nature of "collective grief" carved in stone never becomes tangibly distinct from traditional memorial work.</comment>
