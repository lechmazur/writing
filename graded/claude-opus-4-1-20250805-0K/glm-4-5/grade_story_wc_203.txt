I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's ghost-seeing ability and technical expertise create a coherent character foundation with clear motivation. The interiority shows concrete particulars ("dust accumulation patterns," "vertical spaces and their secrets") rather than stock phrasing. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we understand his intellectual obsession but not the personal cost of his "weightless burden," limiting the character's full dimensional complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Marcus's investigation building through sensory details toward the final connection with spirits. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mainspring barrel enables communication, fulfilling Marcus's lifelong search. The cost is present but somewhat oblique—"answers he had sought for a lifetime" suggests transformation without showing the specific price paid for this knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting actively constrains Marcus's investigation through specific details: the 4:17 PM fluorescent pattern, dust disturbance patterns on ceilings, and the buried horologist's device. The micro-setting of ceiling dust as supernatural evidence is particularly effective. The environment directly enables the story's resolution when "cracks in the façade became visible—not just in the walls, but in reality itself."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus's need to understand and connect with the spirit world—builds through his methodical investigation. The 4:17 PM deadline creates temporal pressure, and finding the mainspring barrel represents a meaningful deepening that changes his options. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice; Marcus achieves connection without apparent loss or struggle at the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of bridging worlds emerges organically through Marcus's technical expertise applied to supernatural phenomena. The "weightless burden" motif effectively captures the paradox of seeing what others cannot. The final image of "space between worlds wasn't empty at all, merely waiting for someone with the right tools" offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though it edges toward tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through Marcus's professional perspective ("practiced caution," "structural anomalies," "resonant energy"). The perceptual signature is distinct—he notices "minute vibrations," "dust accumulation patterns," and "vertical spaces" others miss. Some passages drift toward explanatory ("Marcus had pieced together these stories over months") but the overall texture remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates solid craftsmanship with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "cracks in the façade" appears both literally and metaphorically without clear distinction; "weightless burden" repeats without evolution. The phrase "closing the cracks in the façade between worlds with acceptance instead of fear" attempts too much thematic work in one breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of an elevator technician who reads supernatural signs through ceiling dust patterns offers genuine freshness. The horologist's dimensional device provides an unexpected bridge between mechanical and spiritual realms. However, the resolution—achieving connection through acceptance—follows a somewhat predictable arc that doesn't fully capitalize on the unique premise's potential for surprise.</comment>
