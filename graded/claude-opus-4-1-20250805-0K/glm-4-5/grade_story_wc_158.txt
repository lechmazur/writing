<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's insomnia drives consistent action through verse-making and transformation, but interiority remains abstract ("centuries of longing," "ocean of sorrow") rather than embodied. The final renunciation (death while ensuring others' rest) carries visible cost, though the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—mostly we get poetic abstraction over concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the poet's verses gradually transform the shell through blossoms, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where death becomes perpetual lullabies. However, orientation anchors drift (unclear who sleeps in the shell, what world this is) and the cost feels more declared than dramatized—"mortal journey" ending lacks the visceral price this rubric demands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables transformation, with bioluminescent blossoms physically altering the space. Vivid sensory work ("pearlescent walls," "reef-shadow joy," "off-key wind") creates atmosphere, and the setting evolution from ancient sea-stories to verse-filled walls charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (transforming pain into beauty) signals early and progresses through the blossom armistice, but escalation reads as summary across centuries rather than dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—the poet continues the same action (composing verses) without narrowing options or facing trade-offs until the abstract death at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation metaphor—pain photosynthesized into beauty—without explicit moralizing. The final image of the galaxy postcard remaining as connection-in-isolation resonates beyond plot, and the blossom armistice concept reweights suffering versus serenity throughout, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("connection exists even in isolation").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistent poetic register with controlled rhythm ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy"), though no dialogue tests character distinction. POV distance remains stable in omniscient retrospective, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—the poet observes but rarely through character-particular bias or selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of musical control ("half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("centuries of longing" appears twice identically) and abstract cushioning. Information density drops in middle sections with repetitive descriptions of blossoms spreading, and several template constructions ("Sometimes...the poet wondered," "Now the gargantuan shell pulsed") reveal scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic connection (galaxy postcard) with organic transformation (blossoms from verse) offers a non-obvious angle on isolation and community. The "blossom armistice" between suffering and serenity presents fresh conceptual territory, though execution sometimes retreats into poetic abstraction rather than grounded specificity.</comment>
