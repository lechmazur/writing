<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cyrus's motivation is clear and rooted in decades of searching, with embodied details like his "permanently bent" back and "trembling hands." The negotiation with his ghost provides a meaningful change with visible cost (dissolving the camera wheel), though the ghost's acceptance feels slightly unearned given minimal dramatized interaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through collected story fragments that physically manifest as a bridge. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the carousel restarts and "fractured stillness" transforms to "liquid peace," with clear cost in the camera wheel's sacrifice. The orientation anchors (lagoon, carousel, Cyrus) establish by ~80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and halted carousel create a vivid, constraining environment that shapes Cyrus's choices. Sensory details like "iridescent debris" and "crystallized moon fruit" are selective and purposeful. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting that enables the final confrontation, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from searching for the camera wheel to confronting the ghost, with the carousel's restart as meaningful deepening. The camera wheel's transformation into a bridge of words provides clear tightening of options. Cost is visible when the wheel dissolves, though the ghost's quick acceptance reduces tension slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "eroded ambitions" mirrored in both Cyrus and his ghost. The final transformation from "fractured stillness" to "liquid peace" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The story explores regret and reconciliation through specific images rather than abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled POV and purposeful compression in lyric mode. Perceptual signature evident in how Cyrus notices "fragments," "debris," and broken pieces. Dialogue from the elderly woman and child's song advances the accumulative pattern without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("magnificent carousel," "mesmerizing patterns") and occasional template phrasing ("what felt like both an instant and an eternity"). Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of negotiating with one's own ghost offers a fresh angle on regret narratives. The camera wheel as temporal lens and the story-fragment bridge show imaginative specificity. Some elements feel slightly derivative (time-warps, mystical lagoon) but the synthesis feels cohesive.</comment>
