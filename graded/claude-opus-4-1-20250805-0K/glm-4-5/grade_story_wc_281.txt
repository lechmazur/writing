<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to help her brother drives clear choices, but her "affectionate skeptic" characterization relies on telling rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The shift from skeptic to believer occurs through assertion ("the affectionate skeptic became a believer") rather than earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering the geode's healing properties, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending declares transformation ("the affectionate skeptic became a believer") without showing Maya actually using the protocol or demonstrating its cost. The piece reads more as extended setup than complete arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite geode create specific sensory detail with "fractally precise patterns" and luminescence effects. Setting supports the discovery process but doesn't constrain choices or charge the final image beyond serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (helping telepathy pill victims, saving her brother) but never face concrete on-page test. Maya discovers a protocol but doesn't implement it or encounter meaningful obstacles. No visible cost or trade-off occurs; the resolution arrives through observation rather than pressured choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing through unconventional means emerges but resolves into explicit moralizing: "not in magic, but in the extraordinary potential of the human spirit to heal and transform." The final paragraph tells the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond scientific observation. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise") without grounding in Maya's specific way of noticing. No dialogue to evaluate naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Extensive repetition plagues the prose: "fractally precise" appears 5 times, "willowglass hope" 3 times, "static shock" referenced redundantly. Template cadence runs throughout ("Maya [verb]," "She [verb]"). The phrase "motivation to illuminate hidden pathways" repeats verbatim multiple times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall premise offers fresh potential, and linking neural healing to light patterns shows originality. However, execution remains generic with stock "extraordinary potential of the human spirit" messaging and no specific transformation of the core concept.</comment>
