<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her sensitivity to architectural memory drives concrete choices, though her internal conflict remains somewhat abstract. The moment of discovering Thorne's legacy creates a meaningful shift from explorer to inheritor, with visible emotional cost in "trembling hands" and caught breath. However, peak moments rely on conceptual language ("legacy's burden," "accumulated consciousness") rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from exploration to discovery to understanding, with the film negative serving as the decisive turning point that reframes Elara's mission. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts continuing Thorne's work, with cost visible in the "weight of legacy's burden." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as more than backdrop—the vegetation concealing chambers and the stone holding vibrations directly enable the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cold surface," "rain patter"), filtered through Elara's professional perception. The fireplace with partially burned documents provides the crucial constraint that shapes the story's pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—deepens from curiosity to responsibility as Elara uncovers Thorne's work. The escalation from recording echoes to finding documents to developing the negative creates meaningful pressure, though the resolution relies more on conceptual understanding than dramatized choice. Cost becomes visible in accepting the "weight" of continuing the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory embedded in architecture emerges organically through concrete discoveries rather than assertion, with the film negative bridging sonic and visual records. The final image of Elara "adding her own voice to the dreams of walls" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The concept of architectural consciousness accumulates through specific details rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with measured, professional observation appropriate to Elara's expertise, though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("exuberant greenery," "indelible marks"). POV control is stable throughout with no head-hopping. The prose modulates somewhat with discovery moments but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond professional focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("passages didn't just resonate with sound; they held the imprints" restates the prior sentence's content). Template cadence appears in discovery sequences ("Elara realized... Elara began to understand... Elara committed"). However, clarity remains strong and the closure image lands without obstruction. Information density is moderate with some sentences doing single duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of echo cartography as a profession after climate shifts offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic exploration. The specific synthesis of architectural acoustics with embedded memory feels non-obvious, though execution occasionally relies on familiar tropes (mysterious predecessor, hidden documents). The story commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
