<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear but her internal experience remains abstract and labeled ("cautious exuberance," "terrifying speed") rather than embodied. The story tells us she's "carefully reckless" but doesn't show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final choice lacks the earned causality and visible cost required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive on-page closure—Elena walks toward the chamber but we never see the confrontation or its outcome. The piece reads as setup without resolution, missing the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The drive lens appears Causal but the because/therefore linkages don't narrow options or culminate in a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The archive setting provides atmosphere but doesn't constrain choices or charge the final image beyond serving as a workspace. Sensory detail focuses heavily on visual (dust motes, dim light) without engaging other senses. The glass ink well gets specific attention but functions ornamentally rather than shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (preventing permanent division) but never tested on-page through concrete opposition or choice. The deadline creates nominal urgency but doesn't force trade-offs or escalate pressure through the scene. Elena's work proceeds without meaningful obstacles or cost—she simply translates until breakthrough occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repetition of abstract concepts ("symphonies of truth," "interconnected promises") but lacks concrete dramatization. The story tells us about reconciliation and trust without showing specific embodied moments. The ending offers no resonant answer because the central question never faces an on-page test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elena notices what any scholar might notice. Prose relies on abstract descriptors and therapy-speak ("cautious exuberance," "carefully reckless") rather than character-specific observation. No dialogue appears to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues: "interconnected promises" appears 7 times, "symphonies of truth" 5 times, "carefully reckless" 4 times, "glass ink well" 5 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content ("restore trust after silence" variations). The prose tells rather than shows pivotal discoveries, summarizing breakthroughs instead of dramatizing them.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of ancient texts preventing community division feels generic and lacks specific transformation. The story follows a predictable template without fresh inflection—scholar discovers truth, prepares to share it. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis emerges from the familiar setup.</comment>
