<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in childhood silence creates genuine emotional grounding, and her empathy for unexpressed needs drives coherent choices. However, the ghost lacks embodied presence beyond concept, and Elara's internal conflict remains told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through graffiti exchanges, but closure lacks decisive cost - their connection continues without visible sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The ethereal realm setting delays orientation anchors past 120 words without clear payoff at closure (-0.5 applied).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and graffiti art create vivid atmospheric texture, with the flower press bolt plate serving as a tangible bridge between realms. Setting constrains communication methods and shapes their unique correspondence, though spatial choreography within the courtyard remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of connection/expression is signaled early but never truly tested - no meaningful tightening occurs as their communication simply expands without obstacles or trade-offs. The ghost's loneliness drives initial tension but resolution arrives without protagonist agency forcing difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of articulating unspoken needs emerges organically through the ghost-human connection, with the graffiti art serving as effective metaphor for coded communication. However, the resolution tends toward abstract satisfaction without confronting complexity - both beings find perfect understanding without examining what this connection costs or precludes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistent ethereal texture with phrases like "time stretches like taffy" and "driftingly alert," though diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory. POV remains stable in third-limited, but perceptual signature lacks specificity - Elara's coder background doesn't distinctly color her observations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose flows with intentional rhythm but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern or payoff (-0.5). Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("Their conversations became..." "Each note she sang..." "Through their unique connection...") and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of a self-aware AI ghost seeking connection offers fresh angle on digital consciousness, and the graffiti-as-code communication method shows creative synthesis. However, execution remains safely abstract without bold specificity, and the harmonious resolution avoids risk by granting both characters complete fulfillment.</comment>
