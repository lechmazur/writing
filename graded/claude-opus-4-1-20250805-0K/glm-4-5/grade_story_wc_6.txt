<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to transform her father's destructive legacy into something nurturing is clear and drives consistent choices throughout. The internal contradiction between her heritage and calling creates genuine tension, though some emotional beats rely on telling rather than embodied experience ("unyielding compassion," "scars can sing"). Her choice to protect the grafted roses under fire demonstrates values hierarchy with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's successful protection of the grafted roses, transforming destruction into preservation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as repeated images (black sand, foreign coin, grafts) build meaning toward the closure. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see successful protection but limited price paid. The piece teaches its pattern of transformation symbols early and pays them off, though the emotional stakes could sharpen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and botanical garden create specific, purposeful settings that enable Maya's choices—the garden houses her project requiring rescue, the lagoon provides centering space. Sensory detail effectively narrows during crisis ("smoke-choked streets") and expands in reflection. The black sand functions as micro-setting, constraining her grafting technique and connecting past to present action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fire's approach creates genuine external pressure that forces Maya's protective action, with one clear tightening when embers land in the garden. The dominant stake—proving transformation possible through the grafted roses—is signaled early and tested. However, the resolution feels too neat; the fire is controlled without significant loss or trade-off, limiting the felt cost of her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through scars emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and Maya's navigation of her father's legacy. The recurring "scars can sing" motif gains meaning through action rather than assertion. However, the thematic resolution tends toward the tidy—the explicit stating of the theme multiple times reduces subtextual power, particularly in dialogue with the roses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya's POV maintains consistency with selective perception reflecting her firefighter training and emotional state. The prose modulates between urgent action and reflective moments, though some passages drift into elevated register ("kelp-drift peace") that doesn't fully align with the character's voice. Internal thought remains coherent, but occasional filter-heavy constructions ("Maya saw not just her own face but the legacy") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "gracefully alert" appears verbatim three times, "scars can sing" four times, "migration of clouds" five times. Template cadence runs appear in descriptive passages ("She touched... She collected... She added..."). The prose achieves clarity but lacks density—many sentences restate rather than advance. Opening and closing lines do create bookends, but intervening sections suffer from paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The firefighter-as-arsonist's-daughter premise offers inherent paradox with potential, and the grafting metaphor provides a fresh angle on redemption narratives. However, execution remains safely within expected boundaries—the fire is controlled, the plants survive, transformation succeeds without complication. The piece takes few risks with its promising setup, choosing median emotional and plot outcomes.</comment>
