<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weaver's internal journey from seeing their boundary-less existence as curse to gift provides a genuine arc with embodied details like "brass fittings warm against their fingers." However, the transformation feels somewhat unearned—the vision of bronze towers triggers the shift without sufficient prior causality, and emotional states remain too controlled during the burden-collecting ritual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the weaver's reframing of their trapped existence, with clear anchoring by ~120 words. The accumulative/textural lens holds as burdens literally calcify into geological forms. Yet the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we understand the weaver is "boundary-lessly trapped" but don't viscerally experience what they sacrifice or endure in this moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto with its "metallic reflections" and "natural altar of bronze and crystal" creates a distinctive ritualistic space that constrains the ceremony's requirements. The kerosene lamp's orange glow against bronze walls provides sensory grounding. Setting directly enables the calcification process through starlight orientation, though some details feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting and transforming burdens—progresses through fourteen calcifications with varying weights (king's unexpectedly light, farmer's heavier). The ancient civilization's burden provides the story's tightening moment. However, escalation remains flat; each burden calcifies similarly without building pressure or forcing harder choices, and the weaver's own burden doesn't meaningfully complicate the ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing and preserving others' pain emerges through the calcification metaphor and culminates in "boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but also boundary-lessly connected." The geological transformation of emotional weight into permanent forms offers conceptual resonance. Yet the insight arrives too cleanly through the vision rather than earned struggle, and the final moral statement edges toward explicit rather than emergent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains mystical register with phrases like "fractal within fractal" and "whalebone reverie," creating atmospheric consistency. POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("interdimensional space," "crystallization") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and repetitive constructions like "This one..." appear multiple times.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of lyrical precision ("shingled hush deepened") but suffers from repetitive structures and conceptual loops. "Orienting properly" appears four times with minimal variation; "boundary-lessly trapped" three times; "calcified" becomes overused. The phrase "whalebone reverie" appears twice identically. Information density remains moderate—many sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle burden sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The conceit of emotional burdens physically calcifying into stone offers a fresh literalization of metaphor, and the weaver as interdimensional collector-preserver provides an original frame. The specific burdens (king choosing kingdom over daughter) avoid generic abstraction. However, the transformation from curse to gift follows predictable epiphany structure, and some elements feel assembled rather than organic.</comment>
