<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to understand architectural language drives consistent choices, and the revelation of shared heritage provides earned causality for the mysterious familiarity. However, Mr. Abernathy lacks dimensional conflict beyond exposition delivery, and the emotional progression feels overly smooth without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara inheriting the seal and understanding her heritage, with implied cost of generations of lost knowledge. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure, and the "agreed upon lies" element feels forced rather than integral to the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden meteor shower scene creates vivid atmosphere that enables the revelation moment, and the architectural details (symbols on windowsills, doorway arches) constrain Clara's understanding. The antique desk seal functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the final inheritance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding architectural language progresses through teaching sessions to revelation, but lacks meaningful pressure or opposition. The "interrogation" feels gentle rather than pressured, and no live options are foreclosed with visible cost until the passive inheritance at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of inherited knowledge and lost connections emerges through the architectural language concept and family revelation. However, the ending includes explicit theme statements ("Some truths need the protection of falsehoods") that replace earned resonance, and the metaphor of buildings as ancestral speakers feels overly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and filters architectural observations through Clara's specific perception. However, dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm and subtext, with Mr. Abernathy speaking in overly articulate exposition regardless of emotional weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some template phrasing appears ("Clara recognized... immediately," "Clara understood," "Clara asked") but doesn't obscure closure; the final image of buildings as "old friends with stories" lands effectively despite earlier scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of buildings speaking to those who share their blood offers a fresh angle, but execution relies on familiar mentor-student and lost-heritage templates. The revelation lacks groundwork beyond mysterious familiarity, feeling more convenient than inevitable.</comment>
