<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions, particularly her patient approach with Lila. The internal connection to her own childhood loss drives authentic empathy. However, some interiority relies on telling rather than embodied sensation ("cautious exuberance blossoming in her chest"), and Lila's breakthrough feels slightly accelerated given three months of silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Lila's first words, marking a Decisive Change with emotional cost visible in Maya's tears. The causal lens holds as Maya's patient music therapy approach leads to breakthrough during the eclipse. However, the three-month setup feels summarized rather than dramatized, and the eclipse's role as catalyst could be stronger causally linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sage ridge setting is well-anchored with sensory details (sage fragrance, windswept ridge) that create atmosphere. The eclipse functions as environmental pressure forcing the climactic moment. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices as much as provide backdrop, and some descriptions feel ornamental rather than essential to the narrative pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking through Lila's silence—is clear from early setup. The eclipse provides temporal pressure and Maya's drumming invitation creates the turning point. However, escalation feels gentle rather than pressurized, and the three-month buildup is told rather than shown, reducing the sense of accumulated tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of "ordinary magic" in human connection emerges through Maya's patient work with Lila, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final exchange. The eclipse metaphor of darkness making light more beautiful resonates with trauma and healing. The locket symbolism feels slightly forced but the overall thematic integration through music and connection works.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV through Maya with appropriate psychic distance. Some passages drift into elevated register ("aromatic sentinels," "suspended moment") that doesn't fully match the character's mellow therapist persona. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though Lila's first words feel slightly precocious for a traumatized ten-year-old.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose clarity is generally strong but several passages suffer from overwriting ("eerie twilight," "fragile but real, like a newly opened flower"). Template phrases appear ("tears blurring her vision," "held its breath in anticipation"). The metaphor density in emotional beats reduces momentum, and some sentences could be tightened for greater impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The eclipse-as-therapy-breakthrough concept offers a workable premise but relies on familiar trauma-healing templates. Maya as wounded healer who lost her own parent is well-worn territory. The story executes competently within genre expectations but doesn't transform or subvert them in memorable ways.</comment>
