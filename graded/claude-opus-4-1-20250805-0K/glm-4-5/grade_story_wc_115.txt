<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and his explorer persona consistent, but internal conflict remains largely abstract ("religiously skeptical" vs supernatural experiences). The final realization about "swallowed truths" lacks concrete embodiment—we never learn what specific truth was swallowed or see Marcus make a difficult choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver required closure with cost. Marcus discovers vague "truths" about the factory ghost shift being "far more human, far more tragic" but this revelation occurs through summary rather than dramatized event. The ending's "understanding that some truths carry weight precisely because they remain unspoken" is conceptual assertion without visible or felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is anchored early and creates atmosphere through selective details like the brass valve wheel's glinting surface. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain Marcus's choices—he simply walks through, has visions, and leaves unchanged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs; Marcus experiences visions but faces no opposition or difficult choice. The radio confession creates momentary tension but dissolves without forcing any decision or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repetition of "swallowed truths" and "ghost shift" concepts but resolves into explicit moralizing: "some truths weren't meant to be swallowed but shared." The final paragraphs abandon scene pressure for thematic summary, particularly "truths that refuse to stay buried" which reads as authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with explorer-appropriate diction and controlled psychic distance. However, register drifts into academic abstraction during peak moments ("drowsy alertness that had been creeping over him") and the dialogue from the radio lacks naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("swallowed truth" appears 6 times with minimal variation) and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy. The closure beat contains template cadence: "Marcus felt lighter...the weight of his own swallowed truths finally acknowledged." Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar concepts about hidden truths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise of exploring abandoned mills for supernatural phenomena offers moderate freshness, but execution relies on familiar ghost-story tropes without transformation. The "factory ghost shift" concept remains generic—we never learn specific details that would distinguish this from any haunted factory tale.</comment>
