I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her obsession drives consistent action, with good embodied stress (hair standing, breath held). However, interiority relies on telling ("cautiously hopeful nature") rather than showing through contradictory impulses in scene, and the resolution lacks the visceral cost of her isolation and sleeplessness established earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Decisive Change (broadcasts stop, community healing begins) with clear causal linkage. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "cosmic significance and earthly terror" but don't see Elara pay a concrete price for her interference, and the week-later epilogue dilutes the immediate impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The radio station setting provides functional constraint (vintage equipment detecting subsonic realm), and sensory details work during the transmission scene. But the setting doesn't actively pressure choices—Elara could have done this from any equipment-rich location—and spatial choreography remains vague throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (humanity manipulated vs. freedom) with one meaningful escalation when Elara activates the transmitter. The tension builds adequately but lacks intermediate reversals or complications; success comes too easily without the tricksters fighting back or Elara facing real opposition beyond faculty dismissal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of perception manipulation emerges through events, and the ending suggests humanity awakening from collective delusion. However, the resolution tends toward explicit moralizing ("humanity finally aware of the cosmic game") rather than allowing complexity, and the tricksters remain abstract villains without nuanced motivation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable but voice lacks distinction—Elara's perceptual signature as a signal interpreter doesn't meaningfully color the prose. Excessive filter constructions ("Elara knew," "she had discovered") distance us from immediacy, and the academic register doesn't modulate with emotional intensity during the climactic transmission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from telling over showing ("terrifying efficiency," "cautiously hopeful"), repetitive sentence structures, and abstract descriptors. Multiple paraphrase loops appear (lines about community division repeat the same idea), and the week-later summary deflates momentum rather than maintaining scene pressure through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The cosmic trickster premise offers potential freshness, and subsonic frequency manipulation provides a specific angle. However, execution remains generic—the community division could be any social manipulation plot, and Elara fits the lone-scientist-who-knows-the-truth archetype without memorable particulars.</comment>
