<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness creates a compelling internal logic that drives her unique artistic method and discovery. The contradiction between her disability and profession generates authentic tension, particularly in how she compensates through pattern recognition. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract realization about "patterns of souls" which edges toward conceptual summary rather than embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's discovery transforms her artistic practice with visible cost (the library's imminent destruction). The coin discovery causally enables her final masterpiece. Slight deduction for the cost being more situational (demolition) than arising from her choice, though the urgency effectively pressures the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library functions as both setting and constraint, with moonlight patterns and carved surfaces directly enabling Elara's work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—fingers tracing grain, cool metal against warm air. The setting actively shapes her discovery and final creation, particularly through the hidden compartment that defies natural grain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic project to discovering centuries-old wisdom that transforms her practice, with demolition as temporal pressure. The tightening occurs when the coin's patterns align with her compensatory perception methods. Cost is legible but somewhat external (building destruction) rather than arising from protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that perception transcends visual recognition, embodied in the coin's algorithmic patterns. The final image of "faces without defining them" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the line about "patterns of their souls" which approaches thematic declaration rather than pure emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with clear perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns, grain, light rather than faces. No dialogue preserves the meditative tone. Some filter verb accumulation ("she allowed herself to discover," "envisioning how") slightly dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose has moments of strong specificity ("fractally precise mapping system") but suffers from occasional abstract phrasing ("heightened stillness," "boundaries of perception"). Some redundancy in conceptual statements about seeing patterns versus faces. The final image achieves clarity but middle sections contain mild conceptual loops about perception and recognition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise offers genuine freshness, and the coin as algorithmic key rather than traditional artifact shows originality. The synthesis of disability with artistic gift feels earned. Moderate deduction for somewhat familiar "lost wisdom of ancients" framework and the convenience of perfect alignment between Elara's condition and the Scholars' system.</comment>
