I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through repetitive actions and density of description toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias discovers he can preserve the vows.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias remains static throughout - his "gently meticulous" nature never faces genuine internal conflict or contradiction. The discovery of preservation possibility arrives without earned struggle or visible character cost. His motivation is declared but not dramatized through competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure (discovering preservation is possible) qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - Elias simply realizes he can save the vows without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative structure coheres but the "hope" at the end arrives without earned causality from his measurements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vividly rendered and the magic lantern slide functions as micro-setting that enables the key discovery. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices - it's purely atmospheric rather than forcing tactical decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving luminous vows) are declared early but remain abstract - we never see what happens if they fade completely. The "discovery" of preservation possibility lacks earned escalation; it simply appears from routine measurement without building pressure or forcing difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of preserving meaning against oblivion emerges through repetition but stays surface-level. The story tells us about fading vows and preservation duty without exploring deeper complexity or counter-readings. The ending offers hope without examining its cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality befitting an orderly records chief, with controlled diction like "crystallized," "ethereal," "meticulous." However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature - Elias notices everything with equal, undifferentiated attention rather than through a specific lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Severe repetition problems: "orderly records chief" (4x), "gently meticulous" (3x), "sampling frequencies" (3x), "magic lantern slide" (5x), "while illusions faded to memory" (3x), "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" (3x). These template loops drain momentum. Prose clarity remains adequate but mechanical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept of measuring luminous vows with frequency sampling offers mild freshness, but execution relies on fantasy library tropes without transformation. The discovery resolution follows predictable "all is not lost" template without specific innovation or risk.</comment>
