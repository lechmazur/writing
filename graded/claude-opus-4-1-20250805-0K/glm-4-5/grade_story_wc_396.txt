I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with the crystal reconstitution serving as a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and her "shadow-laced peacekeeper" identity shapes choices, but internal contradiction remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The "weighted breath before reply" phrase appears twice verbatim, creating repetitive phrasing. Her courage manifests through action but lacks the visceral cost or genuine struggle that would elevate the characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the crystal's reconstitution enabling navigation "with understanding rather than fear," showing clear cost through Elena's unconventional method. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward the final transformation. However, the "weighted breath" repetition and some causality softness around how exactly the vintage mirrors enable reconstitution prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create vivid atmosphere that constrains choices - Elena must work in this specific location with its "diamond-like facets" and ancient magic. The vintage shop mirrors function as micro-setting that enables the central action. Setting actively participates in the resolution rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on saving the settlement from "the coming storm" with escalation through Elena's three mirror visits building to the reconstitution. The elders' skepticism provides opposition. However, the storm threat remains abstract and the actual cost of failure never becomes visceral, limiting the pressure's intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of "mapping empathy onto action" emerges through Elena's method of seeing multiple perspectives in mirrors to heal what's broken. The shadow/light interplay and unconventional wisdom resonate without preaching. The phrase "mapping empathy onto action" appears twice identically, creating thematic echo that slightly diminishes organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions like "shadow stretching long before her as if it had a mind of its own." However, "weighted breath before reply" appears twice verbatim, and some phrases like "courageously anomalous" feel artificially elevated. The POV stays stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the shadow-awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("branches catching the moonlight in diamond-like facets") but suffers from repetitive phrasing: "weighted breath before reply" appears twice, "mapping empathy onto action" twice, "courageously anomalous" variations. These loops and the occasionally overwrought metaphors ("ink in water") diminish momentum despite strong individual images.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of reconstituting power through vintage mirror glimpses offers genuine freshness, combining shadow magic with temporal reflection creatively. The shadow-peacekeeper role and lighthouse orchard setting avoid generic fantasy. However, the storm threat and elder skepticism follow familiar patterns without transformation.</comment>
