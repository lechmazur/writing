I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and repeated motifs toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elion's altruistic motivation is consistent but lacks embodied complexity—he operates as a benevolent force without internal contradiction or cost. The ghost's noncorporeal limitations create some tension, yet his emotional state remains static throughout. Aris functions more as a plot device than a character with her "strangely trustworthy nature" told rather than dramatized through specific choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's transformation from crisis to renewal, with the watering bell discovery as the pivotal turn. However, the cost remains abstract—"brambled hope" and "tangled roots" suggest difficulty without showing specific sacrifice or loss. The accumulative structure coheres around the ghost's guidance leading to collective action, but the ending's "forever thriving" undercuts the promised complexity of struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and orchard planet create a distinctive setting, and the "nebula of respite" adds atmospheric texture. The watering bell's seed-pod shape with intricate patterns provides specific detail. However, the setting rarely constrains choices—the eastern fields and floating orchards exist primarily as backdrop rather than active pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The soil depletion creates genuine stakes, and Elion's challenge of communicating through his noncorporeal state adds tension. The discovery of the watering bell provides one meaningful turn. Yet escalation remains gentle—the solution arrives through following instructions rather than wrestling with trade-offs, and the "miracle" unfolds without visible cost or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of collective survival through trust in mysterious guidance emerges clearly, with the ghost-as-benefactor motif carrying resonance. The "strangers to family" transformation provides thematic coherence. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("how one altruistic ghost, through trust in a strangely trustworthy woman, had saved them all") summarizes rather than allowing the theme to resonate through image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the ghost's perspective, with phrases like "celestial doorways" and "brambled hope" creating texture. However, the narrative distance remains too removed—we never experience Aris's internal moment of discovering the messages or her conviction when sharing them. The ghost's omniscient view flattens potential tension from limited knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "floating rock arches" appears four times, "strangers to/became family" three times. Template constructions like "The messages always contained..." and "The ghost's chalked messages now instructed..." create mechanical rhythm. The prose achieves clarity but lacks the density and variation needed for this length—many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ghost-as-gardener premise offers a fresh angle on supernatural intervention, and the butterfly larvae as symbiotic solution shows creative world-building. The chalked messages as communication method provides specificity. However, the resolution feels too neat—the watering bell solves everything without complication, missing opportunities for genuine struggle or unexpected consequences.</comment>
