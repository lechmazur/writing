<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bellhop's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail (trembling hands, phantom tingles) and his choice to sing despite incomplete healing carries visible cost. Internal contradiction between safety-seeking and the need for expression drives the closure, though some introspective passages lean toward summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as details (bolt, discoloration, names) build toward the resonant reconfiguration where singing breaks the fortress's silence-for-safety bargain. The cost is legible in "unpardonable silence" and the risk of losing sanctuary. Minor orientation delay (bellhop's identity/role clarifies gradually) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress and snow create atmospheric pressure, while micro-settings (spiral staircase, piano bolt) directly enable discovery and choice. The fortress-as-sanctuary-prison constrains the final decision effectively, though some descriptive passages ("ethereal blue light") tend ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal recovery to collective liberation as the bellhop discovers the fortress's true nature. The choice between safety and freedom carries clear cost ("unpardonable silence"), with his singing risking the sanctuary. One meaningful deepening through discovery drives the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery of the bolt and names, avoiding abstract moralizing. The final image of snow "dancing with newfound rhythm" resonantly answers whether safety is worth silence without stating it. "Frostbitten hope" perfectly captures the fragile possibility in his choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV maintains consistency with selective perception (focusing on musical/tactile details) and voice modulates appropriately under discovery. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("seraphically mundane") that slightly exceeds the bellhop's established lexicon, but perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though several template constructions appear ("The bellhop understood...The bellhop could remain...The bellhop realized"). Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("ethereal blue light that matched the fortress walls") without clear payoff. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The musician-sanctuary premise offers a fresh angle on safety versus expression, with the fortress-as-living-archive concept feeling earned. The specific detail of nerve regeneration and the piano bolt discovery avoid generic treatment, though the resolution follows somewhat predictable liberation beats.</comment>
