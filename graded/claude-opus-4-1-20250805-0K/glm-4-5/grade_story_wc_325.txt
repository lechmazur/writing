<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide the unremembered is rooted in her brother's disappearance and manifests through concrete actions, though internal contradictions remain mostly told rather than enacted. The claustrophobia trait creates genuine tension against her duty but could be more embodied during peak moments. Her final choice to continue this work "until her own time came" shows earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story follows Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's ritual completion and commitment to continue. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she accepts her role despite costs—with emotional price visible in her acceptance of eventual transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the tidal window creates effective constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The facility's damp air, salt-stained walls, and humming pipes create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elara's movements. The tidal constraint (42 minutes) functions as setting-as-clock, forcing urgency. The undersea cables serve dual purpose as physical infrastructure and metaphysical conduit, constraining her ritual's timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guiding trapped souls through transitions—intensifies as Elara works against the tidal clock. Seven shadows guided shows agency through action, though individual transitions lack differentiation. The tide's return forcing her emergence provides concrete cost, but escalation plateaus rather than builds through the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the forgotten emerges through Elara's actions rather than statement, with the undersea cables serving as metaphor for connection beyond death. The ending image of "sacred silence between" waves resonates without moralizing. Her commitment despite isolation ("cost her friends and career") adds thematic weight to duty versus personal cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance, though perceptual signature could be more distinctive. Voice modulates appropriately during the ritual sequence ("Follow me," she murmured). Some register elevation occurs unnecessarily ("fibrous veins pulsing with humanity's digital lifeblood") but doesn't contaminate closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures, though several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("yawned before her like a tired giant," "fibrous veins"). Information density is adequate but some passages tell rather than dramatize (lines about Dr. Thorne). The final image lands cleanly without artifice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of undersea cables as conduits for psychic energy during tidal windows offers a fresh angle on ghost stories. Elara's specific gift emerging from personal loss grounds the fantastical premise. The combination of technical infrastructure with spiritual passage creates non-obvious resonance.</comment>
