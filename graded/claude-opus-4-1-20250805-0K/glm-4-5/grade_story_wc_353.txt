I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory detail and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara absorbs the sculpture's lost music.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied responses to the discovered music. The emotional progression from ritual gratitude through discovery to tears feels earned. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or meaningful struggle - she's too competent without visible cost or error.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara absorbs the sculpture's music and begins "the work of redemption." The accumulative structure coheres well. However, the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the transformation lacks a decisive before/after that would elevate the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity throughout, particularly the porcelain insulator's rainbow light and the texture of cracks. The siskin alder grove and half-swallowed sculpture create vivid anchoring. The setting actively constrains Elara's work through the sculpture's weathered state and integration with the tree.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring music) is clear but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Elara's process unfolds without obstacles or reversals. While the discovered emotions create texture, they don't force choices or narrow options - the work simply proceeds as intended.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of recovering lost art emerges organically through concrete action. The sculpture as repository of human emotion resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of "redemption began anew" effectively reweights the opening's silence, though it edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, lyrical prose that matches the story's contemplative tone. The perceptual signature is strong - Elara notices in musical terms ("symphonically minded"). Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("empathy in motion") feels slightly forced but doesn't break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory density. However, several instances of elevated diction ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") and some repetitive phrasing around the sculpture's music reduce momentum. The phrase "empathy in motion" appears twice, creating a minor loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of extracting music from wood through touch is fresh, and the post-apocalyptic "Great Silence" provides an interesting frame. However, the execution plays safe - Elara succeeds without complication, and the emotional beats follow predictable patterns. The piece needed more risk in its choices.</comment>
