<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his zen-potter mindset shapes his specific way of perceiving (hands forming circles, approaching with "sharp gentleness"). The internal consistency holds, though the transformation feels more intellectual than embodied—his understanding shifts but we don't see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, just methodical observation leading to insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries (glass revealing timelines, flowers responding to kindness, bees stirring). The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as Kael understands resistance as "loyal memory of love," though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—he resolves to return and share wisdom but pays no immediate price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wasteland/oasis contrast is vivid and the sensory details (thrumming in bones, smoke bending light) effectively build atmosphere. The wildflowers and dormant hives constrain Kael's understanding and shape his final insight about kindness nourishing place, earning the 9+ gate requirement of environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why places resist decay—is signaled early and develops through accumulating discoveries. However, escalation remains observational without forcing difficult choices; Kael faces no opposition or trade-offs, just progressively deeper understanding without visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of nurturing/kindness as resistance to entropy emerges organically through concrete images (flowers tilting toward presence, bees responding to intention). The final insight about "loyal memory of love, awaiting its counterpart to bloom" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, though it edges toward the poetic-abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct meditative rhythm matching Kael's zen-potter consciousness with consistent POV control. Perceptual signature is strong—he sees circular movements, pottery parallels, and interprets through craft metaphors. Some phrases lean purple ("sharp gentleness" appears three times) but voice coherence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several template repetitions weaken momentum: "by following sun patterns" appears verbatim three times, "sharp gentleness" three times, and the "chimney smoke...flattening" image twice without evolution. The density is high but these loops prevent entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of an oasis sustained by kindness-energy offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic settings. The specific synthesis of pottery movements mirroring energy patterns and flowers being "phototropic to kindness" creates memorable particulars, though the resolution toward teaching others feels somewhat expected rather than surprising.</comment>
