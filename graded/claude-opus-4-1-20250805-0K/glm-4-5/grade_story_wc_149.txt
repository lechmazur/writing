<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her vigil to repay Thomas's debt through alchemical resurrection. However, characterization relies heavily on backstory exposition rather than present-scene embodiment, and the bride lacks contradictory impulses or genuine struggle in her choices. The final seed-releasing action carries visible cost but arrives without sufficient internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the bride dissipates after releasing seeds, her debt repaid and Thomas reborn in the bloom. However, the piece unfolds primarily through backstory exposition (lines 7-22) rather than present-scene causality, with the actual dramatic action compressed into lines 15-29. Cost is visible but the heavy reliance on told history over dramatized beats weakens causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with its bioluminescent blossoms and winter-cracked fields creates atmospheric contrast effectively. The carved stone bead functions as micro-setting that constrains the ghost's agency and enables the final transformation. However, spatial choreography within the greenhouse remains vague, and setting serves more as backdrop than active pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying the debt to enable rebirth—is signaled early but develops through exposition rather than escalating pressure. The midnight awakening provides one meaningful tightening when the bead connects with roots below, but most conflict resolution occurs through backstory revelation rather than present-scene struggle. Cost lands in the bride's dissolution but lacks intermediate pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges strongly through the synthesis of debt/love/transformation, with the final bloom embodying both lovers' essences as "mournful in separation yet elated in reunion." The recurring spiral motif (bead→bloom) creates resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending reweights the greenhouse from prison to testimony of transcendent love, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent omniscient distance with lyrical texture ("ashen-veil ghost bride drifted between rows of impossible fruits"). Voice modulates effectively between ethereal present-scene description and grounded backstory. However, several instances of template cadence appear ("She had rushed...Thomas survived...As he lay dying") and the narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "lovingly venomous pollen that made the air thick with dreams" and varied sentence structures. However, multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum (lines 25-27 repeat the mutual tragedy; lines 28-29 restate testimony). Some overwrought figurative language ("skeleton weeds," "morning fog") and filter-verb clusters in peak beats reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost story, alchemical transformation, and love-debt creates a non-obvious angle on supernatural romance. The specific detail of "lovingly venomous" flowers that both poison and preserve offers fresh inflection. However, the resolution through magical seed-release and rebirth follows familiar patterns without significant transformation of the trope.</comment>
