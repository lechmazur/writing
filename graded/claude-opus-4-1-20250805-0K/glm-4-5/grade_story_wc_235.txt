<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's fractured relationship with time and his multiple selves creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly in his jealousy of past versions who haven't seen their grave. The final choice to continue chronicling despite understanding the futility shows earned endurance with visible cost. However, some interiority relies on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that reweight Elias's relationship to mortality and time. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—he continues chronicling knowing every grave is also a cradle, with the cost visible in his "bittersweet recognition." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words, though the temporal confusion is intentionally part of the character's state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain cabin at 8,000 feet functions as both prison and sanctuary, with specific details like upside-falling snow that embodies the temporal distortion. The birch bark scroll with dancing symbols constrains his actions and charges the final image when he rolls it with leather cord. The aurora borealis and snow-covered peaks effectively mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making sense of mortality through chronicling dreams—intensifies through the vision sequence where Elias soars through fractured timelines. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as symbols glow and reality dissolves, forcing him to witness "lifetimes lived and unlived." However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off; he simply continues his work with deeper understanding rather than sacrificing something tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of graves as cradles and the cartography of consciousness metaphor. The final image of dawn over ancient yet perpetually new peaks offers a non-literal answer to mortality's meaning. However, phrases like "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" occasionally state the theme too directly rather than letting it emerge purely through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with controlled rhythm that modulates during the vision sequence ("boundaries blurring until cabin walls became transparent"). The perceptual signature—how Elias experiences time as "slippery, disjointed"—is consistent and character-specific. Some elevated diction ("ethereal journey," "ecstatic vision") occasionally drifts from the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the vision sequence. However, abstract phrases like "terrifying beauty" and "cosmic storyteller" lack textural specificity. Some paraphrase loops appear ("every ending contained a beginning, every loss a discovery" restates "every grave was also a cradle").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a dream chronicler who has seen his own grave and experiences time non-linearly offers a fresh angle on mortality. The specific detail of snow falling upside down and symbols that dance when not directly observed creates memorable particularity. The synthesis feels earned though not entirely surprising.</comment>
