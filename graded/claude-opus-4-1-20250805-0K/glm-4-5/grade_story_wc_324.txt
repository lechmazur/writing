I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elena's discovery method through to preventing a tragedy.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her grandmother's unresolved warning. The child character serves functional plot purpose but lacks depth. Internal conflict between routine closure work and urgent danger creates genuine tension, though some emotional beats feel slightly prescribed rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with Decisive Change - Elena prevents a tragedy by solving her grandmother's decades-old warning. The causal chain from hearing aid to photograph to predator is clean. Cost is visible in the transformation of Elena's role from passive tracer to active protector, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with security's timely arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium creates effective atmosphere and the hearing aid functions as micro-setting that constrains choices. Spatial choreography from atrium to garden to bench tracks cleanly. However, setting doesn't fully pressure choices beyond providing locations for events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine contact tracing to child endangerment with clear tightening when Elena recognizes the predator pattern. The hearing aid's increasing urgency drives action forward. Cost is legible in Elena's shift from providing closure to preventing tragedy, though the resolution via security feels slightly deflated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that the dead's unfinished business can save the living. The photograph's dual purpose - memento and evidence - offers resonant non-literal answer to why the dead call. Final image of "watchfulness beyond death" reweights prior material effectively without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close third with Elena's perceptual signature of interpreting emotional residue. Dialogue between Elena and child feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("ethereal fog," "reeling hush") that slightly contradicts the practical contact tracer perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive use of "reeling hush" (3x) and some overwrought phrasing ("mist-clad atrium," "ethereal fog"). Information density is uneven - some paragraphs advance multiple story elements while others feel padded. The phrase "persistently curious" appears twice verbatim, creating unnecessary echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of using obsolete technology to trace emotional residue offers a fresh angle on supernatural communication. The specific twist of a grandmother's warning saving a child decades later feels earned. However, the predator-in-park resolution follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
