<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters remain ferry guides throughout with consistent "gentle persistence," though internal complexity emerges mainly through collective understanding rather than individual contradiction. The final realization about becoming "ferry guides of courage" shows earned transformation, but individual motivations beyond Maris remain underdeveloped. The dormant dragons as embodied courage provide concrete stakes, yet the piece lacks sharp internal conflict or visible character-specific costs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration when the guides discover their true purpose shifts from ferrying passengers to awakening courage. The broken leash enables this journey with clear causality, and the cost appears as accepting responsibility for courage-awakening. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won, and the conceptual cost remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway and mist-locked passages create atmospheric pressure that shapes navigation choices, particularly when following the star stamp's heat as guidance. The chamber of sleeping dragons provides crucial spatial payoff, and the "waterfall of liquid twilight" offers specific sensory grounding. Setting actively constrains movement through "indirect routes" requirement, though some passages rely on abstract description ("where time flowed backward and sideways") without concrete anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "where unused courage waits"—drives the journey, with the star stamp's increasing heat providing escalation. The guides' agency manifests through their collective decision to seek personal understanding rather than ferry passengers. However, the journey lacks meaningful resistance or complication; the discovery feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and no clear trade-off or sacrifice appears beyond accepting new responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of dormant courage awaiting activation emerges organically through the concrete discovery of sleeping dragons, avoiding abstract moralizing. The shift from external service (ferrying others) to internal awakening (carrying courage) resonates without explicit statement. The final image of invisible dragons as "living star-stamps of potential" effectively reweights the opening's ferry service, though the piece could probe deeper into why courage remains unused.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "boundary between worlds grew thin as silk" creating atmospheric texture. Maris's limited dialogue feels appropriately sparse and weighted, though other guides remain voiceless, missing opportunities for distinction. The prose successfully modulates between mystical description and concrete action, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("waterfall of liquid twilight") without clear POV grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("waves licking stone beneath them") but suffers from repetitive mystical descriptors and abstract spatial markers. Several paraphrase loops appear ("where unused courage waits unused," "wise ferry guides...guides"). The piece maintains forward momentum despite occasional overwriting, though phrases like "where time flowed backward and sideways" lack concrete grounding that would sharpen impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The conceit of courage as sleeping dragons waiting to be carried transforms a potentially abstract concept into tangible discovery. The broken leash as catalyst for self-discovery rather than continued service offers a non-obvious angle on liberation. While ferry guides traversing mystical passages follows familiar fantasy patterns, the specific synthesis of ticket-punching as courage-marking and the intimate scale of cat-sized dragons provides fresh inflection.</comment>
