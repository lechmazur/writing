I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory memories and symbolic resonance rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his grief embodied through concrete actions (trembling fingers, avoiding perfumeries). The internal conflict between needing answers and fearing sensory triggers works well. However, the emotional resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through struggle, and the epiphany about grief/love arrives too smoothly without sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias accepts grief as inseparable from love, with visible emotional cost (tears falling freely). The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering. However, the transformation feels overly neat - the UV light revealing scent memories strains credibility, and the resolution arrives through discovery rather than earned choice, weakening agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting effectively mirrors themes of preservation and loss, with vivid sensory details (tropical warmth, crystal shadows, ghost orchid). The UV lantern and perfume vial function as micro-settings that constrain and enable key discoveries. Minor deduction for some purple prose ("echoes in chlorophyll") that occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding grief triggers) is clear but escalation is minimal - mostly accumulation of memories rather than rising pressure. The ghost orchid's transformation provides external tension but doesn't meaningfully complicate Elias's choices. The resolution comes through passive revelation rather than active decision under pressure, limiting dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between extinct plants and lost memories, avoiding explicit moralizing until late. The final insight about light/shadow and grief/love offers genuine resonance. However, some thematic statements feel over-articulated ("love that transcended absence"), and the connection between lantern-brokering and emotional illumination borders on heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register appropriate to the grieving POV, with some lovely rhythmic moments ("echoes in aroma"). However, voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("sorrow-filled eyes," "molecular structure"), and some passages read more like creative writing exercise than authentic interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Significant overwriting issues throughout: purple prose ("wistful lantern broker with weathered hands and sorrow-filled eyes"), repetitive phrasing about memory and loss, and template emotional beats. The story suffers from paraphrase loops (multiple restatements of the grief/memory connection) and register drift into overly poetic diction. Information density is low with excessive reflection padding the word count.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of using UV light to reveal scent memories offers originality, and the extinct plant greenhouse provides a fresh setting. However, the grief narrative follows predictable beats, and the resolution (accepting grief as part of love) is well-worn territory. The lantern broker profession feels quirky rather than essential to the story's logic.</comment>
