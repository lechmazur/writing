<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The performer's blank expression contrasted with theatrical narration creates a compelling internal contradiction, and his ritualistic whittling reveals character through embodied action. However, the motivation feels somewhat explained rather than dramatized through conflicted choices, and the "cultivate lightness in grief" arrives as summary rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through ritualistic repetition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the performer becomes "a mirror in which others saw their true reflections." The happiness mandate backstory effectively constrains present choices and the dried flowers anchor temporal layers. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final cost—"remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness" gestures at transformation but doesn't fully embody the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The turbines function as both physical and thematic architecture, their "remade hush" constraining the emotional register of the entire piece. Sensory details like "curl of wood falling" and "brittle petal...flakes fall like snow" are selective and purposeful. The farmhouse-as-stage and dried flowers actively shape the performer's choices and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on emotional authenticity versus performance in a post-mandate world, with tension building through accumulation of ritualistic acts. The conflict between "fraud" and "saint" interpretations creates genuine ambiguity. However, the resolution—finding truth in "morally ambiguous space"—lands conceptually rather than through a decisive choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of blank-faced performance creating authentic emotional space. The dried flowers and wooden figures embody the tension between preservation and loss without explicit moralizing. The final image of turbines as "witnesses to the quiet revolution" resonantly answers the central question about emotional expression post-mandate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theatrical register of narrated mundane acts ("With this deliberate incision") distinctly characterizes the performer's voice. POV remains stable and the formal diction suits the ritualistic nature. Some register drift occurs in expository passages about the mandate that shift toward sociological commentary rather than maintaining the performer's theatrical lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm in the performer's narrations. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "remade hush—stillness within motion, silence within sound" restates without advancing. Template cadence appears in the "Some called him...Others called him" construction and filter-heavy passages like "he would sometimes touch" dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of theatrical grief rituals after enforced happiness offers a fresh angle on emotional suppression. The specific synthesis of whittling, performance, and the "happiness mandate" dystopia feels original. The morally ambiguous positioning between fraud and saint avoids easy resolution, though some elements (dried flowers as memory tokens) lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
