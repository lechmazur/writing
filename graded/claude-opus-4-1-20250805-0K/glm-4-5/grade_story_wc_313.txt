<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation to preserve truth and honor the displaced is clear and consistent, with his aunt's revelation providing earned causality for his final choice. The internal conflict between his role as warden and emerging awareness works, though the epiphany arrives somewhat suddenly. His "precisely humane" trait manifests in concrete actions, and the final decision to expose the false narrative carries visible professional risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories and artifacts layer toward Thomas's crystallized purpose to "transform individual memories into shared history." The closure achieves Charged Poise—Thomas stands ready with evidence to challenge the official narrative, with professional cost implied. The photograph discovery sequence builds causally, though the aunt connection feels slightly convenient. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerging reservoir town functions as more than backdrop—it constrains Thomas's choices and enables discovery of the preserved label and photographs. Sensory details like "violet and indigo" twilight and the "mirrored hush" create atmosphere while the physical landscape guides action. The setting's transformation from submerged to exposed directly drives the plot and charges the final image of "sunlight touch[ing] the emerging rooftops."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to maintain the official narrative or expose the truth—emerges clearly and tightens when Thomas discovers his aunt's activism. Escalation occurs through accumulating evidence (label→journals→photographs→aunt's identity), narrowing his options toward confrontation. The cost is primarily professional risk, though more concrete opposition would strengthen the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between official history and lived memory, with the reservoir literally and metaphorically submerging truth. The liqueur label and photographs work as concrete vehicles for abstract ideas about legacy and silenced voices. The final image of stories "spinning silence into meaning" resonates without explicit moralizing, though "false narrative" edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thomas's contemplative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "precisely humane approach" and "spinning stories into shared meaning" that feel character-specific. The perceptual signature shows in how he reads the landscape for history rather than just water management. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("treading carefully along the ridge") that slightly exceeds a warden's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Minor issues include "had, until now, unwittingly upheld" (awkward insertion) and occasional elevated diction ("precisely humane approach") that borders on template language. The opening and closing images connect effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The submerged town concept offers a workable metaphor for buried history, though reservoir towns are familiar territory. The specific transformation—a warden discovering his family connection and choosing to expose suppressed truth—provides modest freshness. The story executes competently within genre expectations but doesn't risk bold structural or perspectival choices that would elevate originality.</comment>
