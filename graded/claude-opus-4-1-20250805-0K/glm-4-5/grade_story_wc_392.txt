I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal turns, culminating in Maya's decision that reweights the entire investigation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal conflict between professional constraints and personal liberation is well-established through the lantern discovery and her "fortified vulnerability." However, the transformation from defensive investigator to truth-seeker feels somewhat rushed in the final beats, and phrases like "watchfully calm" appear as labels rather than embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Maya decides to expose corruption despite career risk, with the lantern linking historical and contemporary liberation. The cost is clear—her career jeopardy—though the immediate stakes of the investigation resolution feel somewhat abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel setting effectively constrains and enables the investigation, with water damage, scratches on the lantern, and the confined space all driving discovery. The underground railroad lantern as micro-setting brilliantly links past and present liberation struggles, though some atmospheric details feel catalogued rather than lived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine investigation to systemic corruption exposure, with Maya's personal liberation arc paralleling the case. The pressure coheres around the lantern discovery and document revelation, though the middle section lacks a decisive tightening moment before the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lantern's dual symbolism—historical freedom pathways and contemporary whistleblowing. The parallel between ancestors' liberation struggles and Maya's professional constraints resonates without explicit moralizing, though "It was scripted" edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains professional investigator register with selective perception ("greenish patina," "water displacement levels"), but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntax. Internal observations feel competent but generic—"analytical mind," "empirical observation"—without unique perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is functional with some evocative moments ("lantern seemed to reverberate with history"), but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Maya noticed," "Maya felt," "Maya's") and abstract emotional labeling ("fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm"). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly around the controlling influence theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underground railroad lantern as key evidence in a modern corruption case offers fresh synthesis. The parallel between historical and contemporary liberation struggles feels organic, though the execution relies on familiar whistleblower templates without fully transforming them through specific detail.</comment>
