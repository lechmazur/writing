<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The engineer's motivation to become "archeologist of abandoned dreams" drives consistent choices through neural interface activation and memory excavation, with visible cost in identity blurring. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" without sufficient embodied contradiction, and the transformation lacks concrete struggle beyond trembling fingers and tears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands as the engineer becomes permanently changed, able to bridge "abandoned dreams and their realization" with visible cost of identity blurring and permanent "quaking reverie." The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks. Minor deduction for soft orientation (canyon location vague) and some conceptual abstraction in the transformation mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon effectively constrains the work environment and the broken mirror's "fractured surface" becomes essential to the device's function. However, spatial choreography remains vague (canyon dimensions, engineer's position), and sensory detail over-relies on visual/light imagery without sufficient tactile or auditory grounding during the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from device modification through neural activation to permanent consciousness transformation, with cost visible in identity blurring and tears. The "quaking reverie" intensifies appropriately. However, the transformation lacks concrete opposition or struggle beyond internal acceptance, missing the resistance that would heighten the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of excavating abandoned potential emerges organically through the device's function and the engineer's transformation into "archaeologist of abandoned dreams." The broken mirror's imperfection enabling perfect function resonates. Deduction for abstract philosophical statements ("beauty in what was left behind") and the final paragraph's slight drift toward explicit moralizing about "abandonment and rediscovery."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive vocabulary ("helix-minded," "synaptic plasticity") matching the engineer character. However, register drift occurs in elevated passages ("ethereal blues," "ancient and newborn"), and the narrative voice lacks sufficient perceptual signature beyond technical terminology. Internal thought remains mostly abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Significant template cadence issues: "The engineer's helix-mind began," "The engineer saw," "The engineer had not merely" creates mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear ("profound transformation" repeated three times, "abandoned dreams" five times). Abstract phrasing like "chaotically precise" and "quaking reverie" substitutes for concrete description. These artifacts touch the closure, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of using a broken mirror's imperfections to access collective memory shows originality, as does the "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" frame. However, the neural interface/consciousness expansion territory is well-worn, and specific execution relies on abstract concepts rather than lived detail that would fully transform the familiar premise.</comment>
