I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes effectively through his fevered obsession with "the weight of a swallowed truth," and his actions follow consistent internal logic. The fever-break opening establishes his altered state convincingly, though some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing ("swaying certainties... quantum-like and unpredictable") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward revelation, but closure remains incomplete on-page—Elias steps into the cold toward discovery rather than achieving it. The "crystallized fragment of meteoric origin" explanation arrives through exposition rather than dramatized discovery, undermining the cost demonstration required for closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain station at 11,200 feet effectively constrains choice—altitude amplifies Elias's prophetic abilities while isolation shapes his methodology. Sensory details like "feet finding cold floor where an inch of snow had somehow blown through" ground the setting viscerally, and the station's instruments create a lived-in professional environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes emerge through Elias's need to understand what he "swallowed" during delirium, but escalation remains largely internal without meaningful tightening. The revelation about coordinates and the cave system advances knowledge but doesn't force a decisive trade-off or demonstrate cost beyond Elias walking into the cold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of perception at margins ("allowing the margins of vision to reveal what merits attention") integrates well with Elias's methodology of smudging illustrations. However, the abstract philosophizing about fate versus free will feels disconnected from the concrete action, and the final paragraph's exposition about "auroral sorrow" and meteoric fragments lacks earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through academic precision mixed with fevered intensity ("metaphysicist and fault-tolerant oracle"). The perceptual signature shows in selective details like the botanical illustration's importance, though some passages drift into overwrought territory ("celestial tears shed for truths too heavy to voice aloud").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("subcutaneous map drawn not in ink but in sorrow"). Several passages loop conceptually, particularly around the auroral sorrow metaphor, and the final paragraph relies heavily on abstract exposition rather than concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of a prophet whose abilities improve at altitude offers freshness, as does the integration of botanical illustration with hidden coordinates. However, the resolution through convenient fever-revelation and the abstract "swallowed truth" metaphor feel less grounded than the story's stronger elements.</comment>
