<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict and drives key plot turns, particularly in revealing the maintenance supervisor's motivations. However, the supporting characters lack depth beyond their functional roles, and the supervisor's despair feels somewhat abstract rather than embodied through specific contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's truth-telling bridging "wonder and routine," with visible emotional cost in the supervisor's tears. However, causality weakens when the Bureau agents suddenly appear with perfect timing and the riddle, and the blackout's cause (supervisor's despair) feels retroactively explained rather than dramatized through prior clues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lightning tower setting effectively constrains choices through access restrictions and the vertical ascent structure, with the transformer room and collection chamber serving as meaningful pressure points. The mechanical beehives and vertical gardens create a coherent world-system that affects tactics, though some technical details remain vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of uncovering the blackout's cause escalates through the tower ascent and revelation sequence, with Elara's compulsive truth-telling forcing disclosure. However, the resolution relies on coincidental arrival of the Bureau agents, and the supervisor offers no resistance, deflating potential conflict at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder in routine emerges organically through both Elara's motivation and the supervisor's misguided actions, creating genuine complexity about technology dependence. The final image of mechanical bees resuming work while Elara smiles effectively reweights the central question, though the supervisor's easy capitulation somewhat undercuts thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elara with appropriate access to her involuntary thoughts, and dialogue differentiates characters adequately. However, several instances of filter-verb stacking ("she muttered," "Elara nodded," "Elara sighed") dull immediacy, and the narrative voice occasionally drifts into explanatory modes that feel detached from Elara's perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose remains generally clear with varied sentence structures, though several paraphrase loops appear ("preserve wonder in routine" repeated twice verbatim, similar phrasing around the blackout cause). The opening establishes atmosphere effectively, but momentum stalls during expository dialogue exchanges, and some metaphorical language ("nectar dusk," "gilded") feels ornamental rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The electromagnetic truth-telling effect offers a moderately fresh angle on the unreliable infrastructure premise, and the supervisor's technology-grief motivation adds specificity. However, the setup follows familiar post-disaster investigation patterns, and the resolution through simple confession lacks the transformative surprise that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
