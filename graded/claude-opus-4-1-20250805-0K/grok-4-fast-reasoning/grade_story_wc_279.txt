<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find meaning in chaos drives concrete actions (creating the mandala, using the tile flake), and her social perceptiveness enables specific interventions that shape the group dynamic. The transformation from discord to "emergent hush" carries visible cost in the lingering "lilac unease," though interiority relies on some abstract phrasing ("whimsical spirit rebelled") rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the mandala's creation, transforming chaos into "emergent hush" with the cost legible in the persistent "lilac unease" and "fragile" peace. The accumulative lens holds as patterns literally accumulate in sand, though the opening orientation takes until "whispering grotto" and "community" to fully anchor the collective situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as both setting and acoustic amplifier, its "whispering gallery" properties directly enabling the story's central transformation through the tile flake. Sensory details like "mist-moistened sand" and "lilac-tinged fog" create atmosphere while the mandala's physical construction grounds the abstract concept in tactile action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual "unlearning confessions" to collective participation in the mandala, with Elara's interventions progressively deepening engagement. The cost manifests in the "fragile" resolution and lingering unease, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mandala serves as both literal and thematic centerpiece, its "interlocking spirals" mirroring the grotto's acoustic properties and the community's tangled forgetting. The final image of "whispers finally hushed into peace" while "unease lingered" offers a non-literal answer to finding meaning in mess—order is achievable but inherently unstable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("watched as voices overlapped," "glimpsed their own chaos"). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Elara's artistic sensibility ("emergent property," "profound, whispering stillness") and some filter constructions dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the prose achieves moments of vivid specificity ("fingers stained with pastel hues," "tile flake tucked into her pocket, where it hummed"), repetitive constructions appear ("Elara's whimsical," "Elara smiled whimsically") and abstract phrases like "emergent hush" and "lilac unease" recur without variation. Template cadence in "for the elder... for the youth" section creates predictable rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic properties, sand mandala creation, and community "unlearning" offers a fresh angle on collective transformation, with the tile flake as amplifier adding specificity. The concept of finding meaning through collaborative art-making during ritualized forgetting transforms familiar workshop dynamics into something more resonant.</comment>
