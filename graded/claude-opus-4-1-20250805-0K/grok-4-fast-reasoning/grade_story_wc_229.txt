I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through sensory accumulation (scent, vibration, intention) toward a resonant moment of connection rather than through strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove that "whispers travel farther than shouts" drives concrete action through the vial's uncorking and the garden ritual. The internal contradiction between his "screaming tenderness" and methodical belief creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "vibrations of intent" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Harlan's spectral guidance—"a warmth bloomed in Elias's mind, not words, but a knowing." Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2. The accumulative build through scent and intention pays off, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and nocturnal garden create vivid sensory grounding that constrains choice—Elias must wait for the post-heat wave dawn when "air would carry night scents into the light." The vial's specific properties and the garden's jasmine/moonflower details actively shape the ritual's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving subtle intention's power over "brute force," with the heat wave's break creating receptive conditions. The escalation through vial uncorking to scent release to Harlan's response follows accumulative logic. Cost remains somewhat abstract—"proof etched in dawn's gentle light"—rather than showing what Elias sacrifices or risks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of whispers/shouts, tenderness/fury, night/dawn without explicit moralizing. The final image of "the garden's scent lingering like a promise kept" resonates with the central question about subtle power. Some abstract phrasing ("vibrations of intent") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"the cobalt tower that pierced the coastal sky like a sapphire blade." POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction ("ethereal," "traversed") occasionally strains against the lighthouse keeper context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("jasmine laced with the earth's quiet pulse") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"screaming in its quiet fury" forces paradox. Template phrases appear: "Minutes stretched into eternity," "gruff laugh." The piece would benefit from pruning some abstract conceptual language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeping, spectral communication through scent, and the vial's purifying properties creates an original blend. The nocturnal garden as medium for beckoning spirits feels fresh. However, the mentor-returns-as-guidance trope is familiar, preventing higher originality scores.</comment>
