<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's monthly personality molting creates genuine internal complexity, particularly his shift from "quiet archivist" to "bold visionary," with the coffee tin secret providing concrete embodiment of his vagrant past. Marcus functions well as pressure point, though his transformation lacks the nuanced cost visible in Elias's arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as the library transforms from "skeletal sanctuary" to "blooming resistance," with the coffee tin's smuggling function providing causal linkage mid-story. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "poetry and friendship could hammer chaos into something eternal," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library setting actively constrains choices ("resources were scarce, guards watchful") and the moonlight creates consistent atmospheric pressure throughout. The coffee tin's "false bottom" detail and the library's transformation from "warped metal shelves" to rebuilt sanctuary demonstrate setting-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal archiving to communal resistance, with the guard's flashlight providing concrete pressure near closure. However, the resolution lacks a decisive trade-off—the resistance succeeds without meaningful on-page loss or sacrifice that would elevate the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The central theme of transforming "chaos into communal light" emerges through concrete library rebuilding rather than abstraction. The coffee tin functions as effective motif linking vagrant past to prison resistance, though the ending line "poetry and friendship could hammer chaos" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register ("luminous fracture," "serpent in the wild") appropriate to the poet-protagonist, though occasional overwrought phrases like "anarchy of confined souls" strain naturalism. The free indirect style handles Elias's perspective cleanly but Marcus remains externally observed without distinct voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("pages yellowed, spines cracked like old bones") but suffers from repetitive "blooming" variants (appears 4 times) and abstract constructions like "ferrying ideas that fractured the monotony." The participial opener "Sorting the books by the moonlight's luminous fracture" creates unnecessary simultaneity confusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The monthly personality molting offers fresh angle on identity fluidity in confinement, and the coffee tin's dual function (vagrant relic/smuggling vessel) shows inventive integration. However, the prison library resistance plot follows familiar redemption-through-literature beats without significant transformation.</comment>
