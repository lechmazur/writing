<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to reclaim her lost homeland drives consistent choices throughout, with internal conflict between suppressing painful memories and needing to understand "the shape of home." The mercury-glass physiology creates distinctive embodied perception ("mercury swirled in her glass-veined eyes"), though some emotional states lean abstract ("clawed at her mind with thorns"). The final transformation from exile to architect shows earned change through accumulated visions and stone-work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elowen's nightly visions building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from seeker to "architect" of memory. Closure lands with "the seer reborn" seeding stories for others, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The pattern of stone-reading through feather texture accumulates pressure, but the final integration of "painful remembrances" into forward momentum feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Labyrinthine Athenaeum as mountain-sized bookstore creates vivid atmosphere ("corridors twisted like veins, shelves groaning under tomes"), and the feather's texture constrains how Elowen accesses the stone's power. Setting actively shapes choices through the alcove refuge and "chamber at the mountain's core." The tactile specificity of "soft as forgotten sighs" and stone grooves that "bloom into words" elevates sensory work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming lost homeland through vision-work—develops through nightly accumulation as "reality yielded further" and visions risk "erasing the present." The "hidden thunder" warning creates tension between past and present, though the final confrontation "amid stacks that touched the cavernous ceiling" resolves without dramatized struggle. Cost appears in the threat that "the past overtook her" but remains largely potential rather than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "buried talents" erupting "like subterranean storms" to reshape reality, with the stone's inscriptions revealing "Home is the curve of shadow against light, the fold where loss meets longing." The final image of Elowen "seeding stories into the tomes, unburying talents for all" resonantly answers the opening's weight of memory. The integration of painful past into creative future avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains distinctive voice through compounds like "mercury-glass seer" and "frost-capped summit," with controlled rhythm in longer periodic sentences. POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in how Elowen experiences visions as "mercury beads on glass." The mythic register occasionally strains ("those shadowed epochs") but largely coheres with the fantastical setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong figurative language ("corridors twisted like veins," "thunder grumbled distantly, hidden in the mountain's belly") creates atmosphere, though density occasionally overwhelms in early paragraphs. Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("remembering became painful" could be more embodied). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, and the prose avoids repetitive structures despite the nightly pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a seer whose glass-mercury form reflects fractured visions offers fresh specificity, and the tactile reading method (feather stroking stone) provides original texture. The synthesis of memory-as-homeland with the physical labyrinth creates non-obvious resonance. While "lost homeland" is familiar territory, the execution through vision-substitution and the final role as story-seeder for others shows genuine transformation.</comment>
