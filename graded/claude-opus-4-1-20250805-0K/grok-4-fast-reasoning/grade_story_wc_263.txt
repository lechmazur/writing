<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear motivation and earned transformation. Elara's blocked creativity drives purposeful action through a believable arc. The interiority feels authentic to an artist's struggle, though some passages drift toward elevated register. Her final breakthrough emerges organically from prior causality with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal progression from arrival through instrument use to breakthrough. Orientation anchors quickly with clear who/where/when. Single scene structure fits scope perfectly with one meaningful tightening as she shifts from external searching to internal surrender. Closure lands on page with decisive change and visible cost under consistent causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway creates vivid, specific atmosphere that constrains and enables action. Setting details are woven through the protagonist's actions rather than static description. The mystical environment directly supports her cosmic reconnection theme and charges the final transformation image. Sensory details reflect her artistic sensibility effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of freeing creativity is established early and drives all action. One clear tightening occurs when external methods fail and she turns to vulnerable rest. Her agency is evident in choosing to use the astrolabe, then choosing surrender. The breakthrough is earned through her journey with visible emotional and temporal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic creative reconnection emerges organically through "remembered stardust" concept. No heavy-handed moralizing; the ending offers resonant visual answer without stating thesis. Subtext operates effectively through imagery and the protagonist's internal journey. The artistic block as spiritual disconnection reads as genuine insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature favoring cosmic and artistic details. However, register remains consistently elevated throughout, potentially exceeding what the blocked artist character would naturally access. No POV leaks or head-hopping. The lyrical consistency may limit naturalistic character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Very dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Metaphorical density ("shadowed rapture," "veils of light," "gravitational longing") pervades high-pressure beats. Rhythm varies well and no scaffolding present, but elevated register throughout creates distance from immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blocked creativity, astronomical instruments, and cosmic reconnection. The astrolabe method and "remembered stardust" concept avoid obvious creative block solutions. Specific atmospheric details and the aurora setting create memorable particularity. Risk-taking in lyrical approach heightens meaning, though perhaps at clarity's expense in places.</comment>
