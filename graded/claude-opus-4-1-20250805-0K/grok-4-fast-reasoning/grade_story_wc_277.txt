<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unearth truth is consistent but her emotional state lacks embodied contradiction during the confrontation. The cousin's trembling hand provides some physical grounding, yet both characters speak in overly articulate, explanatory dialogue ("proving extraterrestrial interference in human affairs") rather than fragmenting under pressure. The rosewood pen nib revelation works as a micro-choice but the resolution feels too neat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story reaches a Decisive Change when Elara exposes Quill's hoax, but the cost remains abstract—we see his eyes widen but no concrete consequence. The proof by contradiction with the pen nib provides causal linkage, yet the revelation arrives too cleanly without intermediate pressure. Opening orientation is clear but the shift from journalist's call to observatory visit lacks transitional grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory dome as "silver sentinel" and the telescope's "conspiratorial eye" create atmosphere, while the rosewood pen nib's constellation etchings provide tactile specificity. The setting above clouds on Mount Helix establishes isolation effectively. However, the observatory's interior beyond the control panel remains vague, and sensory detail favors the visual over other senses that might heighten the confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing family secrets about alien orbits—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening. Elara's intervention feels predetermined rather than forced by escalating pressure; she simply arrives and disproves Quill's theory. The "orbits of regret" concept provides thematic resonance but doesn't create concrete obstacles or force difficult trade-offs in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" metaphor connects family legacy to cosmic patterns, offering conceptual depth. However, the theme emerges more through explicit statements ("loops where mistakes circled back") than dramatized complexity. The ending's neat resolution—hoax exposed, truth freed—lacks the ambiguity or lingering cost that would elevate thematic resonance beyond surface-level journalism-versus-truth binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture beyond newsprint metaphors ("sharp as a fresh broadsheet"). Dialogue between Elara and Quill sounds artificially explanatory, with both characters speaking in complete, complex sentences despite high stress. The "solemn playfulness" tone appears sporadically but doesn't modulate naturally with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Multiple prose artifacts weaken momentum: "whose empire of ink and headlines spanned continents" reads as template biography; "velvet sky" and "silver sentinel" are stock descriptors; the parenthetical word-count tracking disrupts flow. The phrase "orbits of regret" appears four times without evolving meaning. Paragraph lengths lack variety, creating visual monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of astronomical data concealing journalistic scandals offers a fresh angle on family legacy stories. The proof by contradiction using constellation etchings shows ingenuity in resolution method. However, the execution relies on familiar corruption-exposed beats, and the hoax revelation arrives without surprising transformation of established elements.</comment>
