<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is consistently rooted in his childhood oath evolving into life's work, with the final choice to "immerse not just relics, but his guarded heart" earning a meaningful internal shift. However, the emotional progression relies on abstract labels ("velvet disquiet," "loneliness of a scribe") rather than embodied contradiction, and the diagnostic self-awareness in "hoarded none" undermines crisis authenticity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memories layer toward Elias's acceptance of emotional vulnerability—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("guarded heart"). The childhood memory anchors causally to present action through the phonograph shaving. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the cost remains somewhat abstract ("etched forever in the scribe's soul") rather than concretely dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard setting constrains and enables choices beautifully—Elias must use rainwater pooled at the tree's base infused with "the garden's loamy breath" to activate the shaving. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mossy paths," "wax cylinder...shimmered faintly"). The setting actively participates in the prophecy's revelation and charges the final image with "apples glowing like embers."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias confronting his emotional isolation through the prophecy—deepens when the vision "mirrored his own archived sorrows." However, escalation remains primarily internal without a concrete tightening that forecloses options. The prophecy's content about "hearts unraveling" stays abstract rather than forcing a specific trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between archiving others' emotions and hoarding none of his own, with the phonograph shaving serving as a bridge across time. The final image of pressing the prophetic shaving to his chest resonates without stating a moral. However, the prophecy's content feels generic ("hearts unraveling, emotional patterns fracturing") rather than offering specific particulars that reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the "venerable oath scribe," with controlled rhythm in phrases like "the city's devouring sprawl." However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("velvet disquiet," "loamy breath") without clear POV justification, and the dead language dialogue feels ornamental rather than necessary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("apple trees whispering secrets to the starlit skyline") but suffers from density issues with figurative language in most sentences without payoff. Multiple abstract metaphors pile up ("genie's wish," "bridge across centuries," "embers in the velvet night"). Template cadence appears in the memory sequence ("had sneaked...pocketing it...vowing silently") and paraphrase loops occur with "disquiet/unease" variations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard garden concept offers originality, and linking childhood memory to present prophecy shows synthesis. However, the emotional arc of isolated archivist learning to feel follows predictable patterns, and the prophecy's vague content about "hearts unraveling" lacks the specificity that would elevate beyond template.</comment>
