<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (amoral philanthropist vs. secret sentimentality) act simultaneously throughout, creating genuine internal tension. The final choice to release the egg shows embodied emotion and cost, though some passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("haunted by echoes") rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's act of release, with visible cost (risking scrutiny of his empire). The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the final image of rain washing away evidence. Minor orientation wobble around "these very lowlands" lacks specificity but doesn't break closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt flat setting actively constrains choice through the crack-map that guides Elias's path, and the environment charges the final image with rain beginning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("surface yielding slightly under his weight like fragile bone"), though occupational detail about the mineral extraction scheme remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the echo vs. maintaining his empire) tightens through Elias's physical journey following the crack-map to the basin's heart. The cost is legible when he risks scrutiny by releasing the egg, though escalation could be sharper through more concrete opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the extinction/preservation paradox without moralizing. The final image of rain washing away evidence while Elias walks back "a little less fractured" offers resonant ambiguity about redemption and erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's perspective, with strong perceptual signature ("cracked mosaic of white desolation"). Some passages drift toward overwriting ("fractured grace of the landscape evoking a ballet frozen mid-step") but control mostly holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though figurative density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("ghosts," "living storms," "heartbeat" in quick succession). The "amoral heart a little less fractured" feels forced thematically. Information density is high and propulsion maintains through most beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of an environmental destroyer secretly preserving what he's destroyed offers fresh moral complexity. The crack-map as migration route memory is inventive, though the passenger pigeon egg strains credibility (extinct 1914, no preservation technology).</comment>
