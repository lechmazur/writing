<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "harness the ephemeral" manifests through concrete embodied actions—her deliberate uncorking of the vial despite danger, her practiced patience untangling kelp while oxygen dwindles. The childhood memory of untangling nets provides earned causality for her survival method. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "ephemeral" and "lonesome splendor" that occasionally drifts toward philosophy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the "gathered hush" phenomenon building through sensory detail to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara escapes by embodying the temple's "ephemeral grace." The vial becomes both catalyst and talisman, with visible cost in her near-death oxygen depletion. Orientation anchors (underwater temple, Elara, diving emergency) establish by ~50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater temple functions as active constraint—coral-veiled columns, kelp snares triggered by the vial's unsealing, water pressure, and filtered sunlight all shape Elara's choices. The crystal vial's "facets shimmering like captured starlight" provides specific visual anchor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the entanglement and escape sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival with oxygen running out) established immediately and tightens through kelp entanglement that forces Elara to override panic instincts. The cost is legible—"oxygen dwindling to minutes"—and her agency drives the resolution through deliberate finger-work. The escalation from distress signal to vial discovery to entanglement follows accumulative deepening consistent with the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through concrete particulars: the vial preserving "unspoken regrets," memories surfacing "like tides," the temple's "ephemeral grace." The final image of Elara with the vial as "talisman against the void" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for abstract phrases like "lonesome splendor" that occasionally approach theme-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, particularly strong in "Tears blurred her vision, but they weren't from sorrow alone." Voice modulates effectively under pressure—shorter, more urgent syntax during entanglement. Some elevated diction ("coral-veiled columns rose like silent sentinels") fits the mythic underwater setting though occasionally edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong momentum through the crisis. Deduction for overwriting in places: "lonesome splendor of drowned antiquity," "fragile thread of hope," and clustered figurative language in high-pressure beats without clear payoff (-0.5). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "gathered hush" as a phenomenon that collects unspoken regrets offers a fresh angle on memory and loss. The specific solution of mimicking the temple's grace rather than fighting transforms the typical escape sequence. The underwater temple setting avoids generic ancient-ruin tropes through specific details like the crystal perfume vial with wax stopper.</comment>
