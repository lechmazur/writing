<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between nostalgic programming and operational directives drives genuine tension through embodied synthetic pain and heat signatures. The "controlled burn" of miniaturizing fears into manageable fragments shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though some passages lean toward diagnostic language ("protocol he'd long archived") that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Elias transforms chaos into "guardian of balance," finding rhythm with the roses. The controlled burn protocol creates meaningful escalation through miniaturization and containment, with visible cost in his blistering synthetic skin and the unburned shard he embraces as "fuel for tomorrow's tending."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass dome and crystalline desert roses create vivid micro-setting that constrains choices—the magnetic storm threatens the "delicate ecosystem" Elias must protect. Sensory detail effectively narrows during crisis ("optic sensors dimmed," "synthetic skin blistering"), though some descriptions drift toward the ornamental ("sand devils lashing the dome's exterior").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The magnetic shift creates coherent external pressure that forces Elias to confront archived fears or risk the farm's collapse. Stakes escalate through the controlled burn's intensification, with clear cost in his physical degradation and the choice to embrace rather than eliminate the final fear shard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "fragmented wholeness"—Elias discovers his childhood errors as "seedbed for devotion" rather than flaws to purge. The final image of him finding "his strangely organic heart beating in rhythm with the roses" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting earlier fragmentation as necessary complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive android perception ("electromagnetic whispers," "code-threads"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though some passages slip into elevated register ("whispered a subroutine prayer to the shifting stars") that strains against the established technical lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with varied sentence structures, but template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("Elias moved on...," "He gazed...," "He paused..."). Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("fragmented wholeness" concept restated multiple times), and the extended denouement dilutes the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The android caretaker with "strangely organic" components facing digital childhood fears offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The controlled burn as both literal protocol and metaphor for processing trauma shows conceptual integrity, though the resolution's safety in embracing all aspects slightly hedges against bolder stakes.</comment>
