<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's meditative nature manifests through concrete actions (pausing work, retracing paths) with internal contradiction between seeking and fearing grief's shape. The spectral mentorship creates genuine pressure on choices, though Liora's wisdom occasionally veers toward diagnostic clarity. Character change from isolation to connection is earned through accumulated ritual actions, with visible cost in the greenhouse monument.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through butterfly imagery, ribbon patterns, and family grief layering toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where collective grief transforms from "void" to "resilient braid." Cost is legible in the completed gravestone monument and Liora's departure. Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptualization of grief's "shape" rather than more embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains and enables key choices—its "creaking" antiquity holds family history while butterflies' migration creates temporal pressure. Sensory detail ("damp earth and wilting vines," "glass fogged by breath of forgotten seasons") is selective and purposeful. The ribbon's physical weave charging the final dinner scene elevates setting-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering collective grief's shape) escalates through nightly greenhouse returns and expanding retracings from mother's paths to family graves. The butterfly migration creates natural temporal pressure. Cost manifests in the completed monument and transformed family dinners, though middle development could show more concrete obstacles to the discovery process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images—ribbons' colored threads revealing "knots of shared lament, loops of enduring love." The transformation from individual to collective mourning resists tidy resolution, embracing grief as "resilient braid" rather than absence. Final dinner scene with Elias's own poem offers non-literal answer to the central question through embodied ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("wings a silent thunder against the calm of twilight") that maintains consistency through emotional intensification. Third-person limited POV holds steady with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shown through craftsman's attention to texture and pattern, though occasional elevated diction ("amorphous force") slightly exceeds Elias's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures support the meditative tone. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "thundering calm" phrase (4 instances), some filter-verb clustering ("Elias felt," "he sought," "he needed"), and occasional purple prose in butterfly descriptions that don't fully pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship as grief counseling offers fresh angle on mourning narrative, avoiding simple haunting tropes. The synthesis of craft (gravestone carving) with emotional work creates organic originality. Specific detail like ribbon colors coding different losses elevates beyond generic grief story, though the resolution toward acceptance follows somewhat predictable arc.</comment>
