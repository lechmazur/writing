<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as guardian, with internal consistency between her "regally unpretentious" demeanor and methodical approach. The character shows embodied patience and strategic thinking through concrete actions like ink preparation and message placement. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around cosmic balance and slightly convenient resolution of Varak's dissolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Varak dissolves and cosmic balance restores, with visible cost in his "graceful dissolution." The causal chain from cryptic messages to collective revelation to confrontation holds cleanly. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. Deduction for the somewhat convenient gathering of seekers and the slightly abstract nature of the "rune's influence" spreading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient library setting constrains Elowen's tactics to book-based messages and provides the labyrinthine structure for her covert campaign. Specific details like "dust motes danced in shafts of ethereal light" and "weathered tomes stretched into infinity" create atmosphere while the frozen constellations mark temporal stakes. The setting directly enables the method and shapes the confrontation space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (usurper's false throne fracturing cosmic balance) with escalation through spreading messages, growing unrest among Varak's spies, and culminating confrontation. The protagonist drives the pressure through deliberate message placement. Cost is somewhat abstract ("realms drift into chaos") rather than viscerally felt, and Varak's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus illusion emerges through the concrete action of hidden messages exposing forgery, with the rune of drift serving as both literal tool and thematic anchor. The final dissolution offers a non-literal answer about inevitable revelation. Some deduction for abstract phrasing around "balance of the cosmos" and slightly neat resolution without exploring moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains epic fantasy register consistently with phrases like "weathered tomes stretched into infinity" and "perpetual twilight." POV control is stable throughout with appropriate narrative distance for omniscient fantasy. Some repetitive phrasing ("regally unpretentious" used twice) and occasional elevated diction that borders on purple prose in descriptions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the pause of shifting constellations" repeated, abstract phrases like "fractured the balance of the cosmos"). Some template cadence in the message-placing sequence. Information density is moderate with some passages doing single duty. Minor issues with abstract rather than concrete language in key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of exposing a throne usurper through library messages offers a fresh angle on the overthrow narrative, avoiding direct confrontation for methodical revelation. The "diminutive titan" paradox and iron gall ink preparation show specific detail. However, the resolution feels somewhat safe and the cosmic stakes remain abstract rather than grounded in lived detail.</comment>
