I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical curiosity and grief-driven motivation are well-established through concrete actions (tracing maps, cross-referencing journals, comparing footage). The internal conflict between scholarly detachment and personal loss creates genuine tension. However, the resolution lacks embodied emotion at the crucial chapel entry—"empathetic weight of ages" remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias crossing the "divide" between known/unknown, completing his father's quest. Causality flows logically from map discovery through footage comparison to chapel opening. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we don't see what Elias sacrifices or how the discovery changes him beyond symbolic completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vault and moors settings actively constrain and enable choices—the vault shields Elias's work, the henge guards secrets, the torn map guides action. Sensory details like "rain-scoured fresco vault" and "brooding sky" create atmosphere while the shifting stone alignment and concealed latch provide concrete discovery mechanisms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving his father's disappearance—drives consistent pressure through methodical investigation. The footage comparison reveals patterns that narrow options toward the chapel. However, escalation remains steady rather than intensifying; no reversal or complication forces Elias to pay a price for his discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "whispered chapel" concept elegantly merges literal place with metaphorical silence, and the torn map physically embodies the known/unknown divide. The theme of interpreting silence through empathy emerges from concrete actions. Yet the ending doesn't fully reweight earlier material—the chapel's actual whispers or their meaning remain unexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with phrases like "methodically curious fingers" and "perceptive framing." The formal register suits Elias's character. Some passages drift toward overwrought ("empathetic weight of ages"), and dialogue absence means we can't evaluate character distinction, but POV control remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias traced," "Elias cross-referenced," "Elias stepped") and abstract emotional descriptors ("empathetic weight," "shielded openness"). Several paraphrase loops appear (father's quest described multiple ways). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot but some reiterate established facts. The meta-commentary about word count disrupts immersion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The parallel footage comparison across decades offers a fresh investigation method, and the map's physical tear as metaphor shows ingenuity. However, the lost archaeologist father and ancient mystery chapel are familiar tropes without significant transformation. The resolution follows expected patterns without surprising synthesis.</comment>
