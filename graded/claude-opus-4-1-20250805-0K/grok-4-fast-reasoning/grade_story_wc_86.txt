<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between guilt and diplomatic duty drives meaningful choices, particularly his decision to give the drawer pull to Tomas. The characterization relies heavily on reflection rather than embodied emotion in crisis moments. Lira and Tomas remain functional rather than fully realized, though the brother dynamic pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prisoner exchange completes with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the drawer pull transforms from talisman to bridge between brothers, showing cost through "mistakes alchemized into something enduring." Causality holds but the stakes feel abstract—we never learn what information the spy carries or why Tomas was captured. The orientation anchors arrive late (prisoner exchange context not clear until line 13).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The parapet setting provides atmospheric pressure through mist and wind, constraining the exchange to this neutral ground. Sensory detail focuses heavily on visual/tactile with missed opportunities for sound beyond "wind howled." The moon phases as timing mechanism integrates well but other environmental details remain ornamental rather than shaping choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (successful prisoner exchange) progresses linearly without meaningful reversal or complication—Lira's momentary hesitation provides texture but no real obstacle. The personal stake (reconciliation with Tomas) carries more weight but develops through gesture rather than tested choice. Cost remains conceptual ("recycling mistakes") rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The drawer pull successfully evolves from personal talisman to symbol of transformation, accumulating meaning through grandmother's legacy, diplomatic tool, and finally brotherly reconciliation. Theme emerges through action but occasionally surfaces as explicit statement: "recycling old hurts into lessons that endure." The ending image of "mended worlds" resonates without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV maintains stable third-limited through Elias with controlled psychic distance, though interiority tends toward elevated register ("labyrinth of what-ifs," "alchemized"). Dialogue between Elias and Lira carries appropriate formality but lacks distinct voice signatures. The narrative voice occasionally drifts into writerly constructions that distance from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from consistent overwriting: "storm-worn parapet," "furrowed hush," "untethered alliances prematurely." Template constructions appear throughout ("Elias nodded," "Lira lingered," "Elias smiled faintly"). The paraphrase loop in lines about recycling mistakes (paragraphs 5, 8, 10) dulls momentum. Strong opening image but repetitive "mist" references (7 instances) create monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The drawer pull as diplomatic token shows modest ingenuity, transforming a domestic object into a bridge between political and personal reconciliation. However, the prisoner exchange framework follows familiar beats without surprising turns. The moon-phase timing adds texture but doesn't fundamentally alter the expected negotiation structure.</comment>
