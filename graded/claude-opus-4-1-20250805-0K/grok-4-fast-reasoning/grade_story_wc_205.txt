I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding literary standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and poetic density toward a conceptual repricing where Elias transforms revolutionary failure into cultural mythology.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from defunct revolutionary to cultural architect is well-motivated through concrete actions (etching verses on shard, creating ceremony). The "burnished sorrow" effectively embodies his emotional state throughout. However, the supporting cast remains functional rather than fully realized, and some internal transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("tentative hope").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where archaeological dispute transforms into unified myth through Elias's poetic devise. The accumulative structure coheres around the storm ceremony as focal point. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt - the transformation lands intellectually but lacks immediate emotional price that would elevate the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting effectively pressures choices - the time storms force the mirror-covering ritual that Elias transforms. Vivid sensory work: "spires of filigreed stone twisted like frozen screams," "chronal mists." The visible time concept meaningfully constrains action throughout, though some descriptive passages edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reimagining civilization to heal revolutionary wounds) is clear and maintained. The storm ceremony provides meaningful escalation as Elias transforms defensive ritual into unifying myth. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined - the group's acceptance and transformation happens too smoothly without sufficient resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "burnished sorrow" into "golden legacy." The archaeological dispute serves as effective metaphor for reimagining collective identity. The final image of the "jewel of contrived history" resonantly reweights earlier material, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("revolutionary reborn—not in arms, but in...").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic texture suits Elias's character ("gilded corridors," "spectral silk"). The elevated register maintains consistency and supports the baroque setting. However, the prose occasionally tips into purple territory, and dialogue (minimal as it is) lacks naturalness: "We cover mirrors not to hide, but to dream through the veil."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of lyrical precision alternate with overwriting. Information density varies - some passages achieve multiple effects while others feel ornamental. Notable template cadence in places: "Elias whispered...Elias composed...Elias pocketed." The prose would benefit from pruning figurative excess, particularly in non-climactic beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of visible time as "shimmering haze of timelines" offers fresh angle on temporal mechanics. The transformation of archaeological dispute into cultural healing through poetic ritual feels specific to this world and voice. The integration of failed revolution with cultural reimagination avoids expected revolutionary narrative paths.</comment>
