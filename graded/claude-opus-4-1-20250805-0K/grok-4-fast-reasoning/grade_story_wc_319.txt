I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens based on the density-building pattern and the final transformation through acceptance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elowen's dimensionally homesick yearning creates consistent motivation, and her transformation from passive waiting to active acceptance shows earned change. The internal conflict between feral instinct and guardian duty operates throughout. Loses points for some diagnostic language ("dimensionally homesick" reads as label) and the convenience of the pendant appearing exactly when needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elowen accepts uncertainty as ally, with visible cost in her transformation. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward this acceptance. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph 3. Deducted for the pendant's convenient appearance and some causality softness in the cultist backstory timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen garden constrains choice effectively—Elowen must internalize its cold to survive. Sensory detail ("breath fogging," "frost biting her muzzle") grounds the ethereal premise. The pendant functions as micro-setting that enables transformation. Setting evolution from frozen exile to thawing perception tracks with character arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling homesickness through acceptance—deepens when Elowen shifts from waiting to interiorizing. The pendant provides meaningful escalation by offering a method. However, the conflict lacks external pressure after the cultist flashback, relying heavily on internal resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the uncertainty-as-companion concept, avoiding explicit moralizing. The pendant's "boundaries of light" motif effectively bridges physical and metaphysical stakes. The final image of mist parting for the trusted ally resonates without stating the lesson. Minor deduction for "dimensionally homesick" feeling prompt-derived.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains dreamlike consistency with phrases like "thorns etched crystalline patterns" and "spectral fingers." POV control stays clean with Elowen's feral-scholarly duality. Some register elevation ("interiorizing exteriors") strains against the feral guardian's presumed lexicon. Perceptual signature strong in how she experiences the garden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Through the veil of sleep" appears three times). Template cadence in middle sections ("She nosed it free...She envisioned...She decided"). Information density high when describing sensory detail but some paraphrase loops around the homesickness concept detract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The feral library guardian concept offers fresh synthesis—wild creature protecting knowledge. The transformation of waiting from passive to active method shows originality. However, the mystical pendant resolution and dimension-hopping feel somewhat familiar from fantasy templates, preventing higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
