<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows clear motivation rooted in rebellion against thought taxation, with concrete embodied actions (planting seeds, murmuring incantations). His "charming rogue" trait manifests through specific interactions and jest. However, internal contradiction remains mostly declared rather than simultaneously acting in scene, and the final choice lacks the visceral cost needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (cryptic language, warped gardens) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the greenhouse becomes "their bastion." Orientation anchors (2147, greenhouse, Thought Levy Act) land early. Cost appears in "tax-drones patrolling" and "enforcers raided" but remains more atmospheric than personally felt by Elias at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choices through "bio-static interference" protecting rebels and enables the warping technique. Vivid sensory detail ("sweltering haze," "iridescent beetles," "loamy soil") filtered through Elias's rebellious POV. The warped garden patterns that fool scanners make setting essential to the resistance method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving untaxed thought) established early with one meaningful deepening as the warp takes hold and protects the garden. The drone's approach creates pressure that the bio-interference resolves. However, Elias faces no personal trade-off or foreclosed option; the success comes without visible cost to him specifically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of coded resistance emerges through concrete garden patterns spelling "RESIST" and the gourd's rattle as "defiant pulse." The final image of Elias as guardian of sparks planted "where taxes couldn't reach" offers resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates well in "candidly cryptic" dialogue and warped growth hiding messages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and Elias's distinct perceptual signature ("cutting through humid chaos like a sly wink"). Voice modulates appropriately with pressure. Dr. Lira's cryptic dialogue ("plant what rattles the silent storm") carries effective subtext, though other members remain voiceless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong prose rhythm and varied syntax supporting scene momentum. Vivid imagery like "vines twisted like frantic thoughts" does multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("verdant," "nascent") slightly strains the rogue scholar register but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density high with minimal scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian thought-control with guerrilla gardening creates non-obvious resistance method. The bio-alchemy warping and aerial glyph messages show genuine ingenuity. Specific details like "gourd rattle seed" with "hidden grains" avoid generic rebellion tropes, though the thought-tax concept itself echoes familiar dystopian territory.</comment>
