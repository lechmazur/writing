<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to transform silence into comfort is well-grounded and drives his careful modulation of the journey. His internal consistency holds through micro-choices like adjusting sails to muffle noise and releasing the storm glass mist. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around silence/comfort that could be more embodied, but the character arc from routine operator to active comforter lands with earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly with density increasing toward Lira's transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira shifts from loss-shadowed to smiling, with cost visible in her initial state and Elias's perpetual dedication. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The pattern of silence-as-comfort accumulates through concrete actions (mist release, noise monitoring) to earn the final teaching moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The aerial city's sensory specificity excels—"prisms humming faintly underfoot," "rain-kissed stone" fragrance—with setting actively constraining choices through aether-winds and mooring requirements. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting that shapes tactical response. World rules remain consistent throughout, and the drifting heights create genuine spatial pressure for navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (transforming silence into comfort for Lira) progresses through meaningful deepening as the storm glass demonstration catalyzes calm. Cost is visible in Elias's perpetual transit life and Lira's initial grief-shadowed state. The aether-wind complication tests Elias's method and forces active intervention, though more immediate pressure on the choice would strengthen the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between noise that "scatters" and guided silence that "gathers the soul," avoiding direct moralizing. The storm glass serves as both practical tool and thematic vehicle for transformation. Final image of Lira's smile and whispered acknowledgment resonates without stating the lesson explicitly, though the silence/comfort dynamic occasionally edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm—"vaulting hush" motif creates textural coherence without overwhelming. POV distance stays stable with Elias as focalizer, no head-hopping. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and restraint ("The winds are kind today"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the gondola operator's expected lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose rhythm varies effectively and supports the meditative tone, but repetitive phrasing appears ("vaulting hush" x4, "in transit" x3) without full pattern-teaching payoff. Some abstract constructions blur immediacy ("silence transforming under his care into a comfort"). Information density is generally strong with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though momentum occasionally slows in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The aerial city setting with gondola navigation offers fresh perspective on familiar journey/transformation arc. Specific details like the storm glass vial's crystallization mechanics and the "Whispering Peaks" destination avoid generic fantasy. The synthesis of weatherman traditions adapted to aerial heights shows creative world-building, though the emotional arc itself follows expected patterns.</comment>
