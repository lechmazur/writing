<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through grief and duty is well-established, with concrete embodied reactions (trembling hands, fidgeting). The shepherd encounter shows meaningful character change through specific action. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("quiet despair") and slight repetition in describing jitteriness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through the pendant's transfer creating resonant transformation. The gift-giving crystallizes Thorne's legacy with visible cost (giving away the precious pendant). Orientation anchored early and causality holds throughout, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway creates atmospheric pressure and the pendant functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frost-kissed gravel," "ribbons of green and violet"). The setting actively shapes the encounter and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on honoring Thorne's legacy versus keeping the pendant, with meaningful escalation through the shepherd encounter. The transfer decision shows clear agency with visible cost. Pressure builds through memory and present action, though could use one more tightening beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming routine into wonder emerges organically through the pendant's action and shepherd's transformation. The ending reweights earlier material without stating a moral. Subtext operates well through gesture and the vibrating pendant's non-verbal communication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice has distinct texture in phrases like "fade from memory to myth." Some repetitive phrasing around "jittery" and "vibrating sympathetically" prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Multiple instances of repetitive phrasing ("vibrating sympathetically" appears 3 times, "coax wonder from the routine" twice, "germinating" variants). These loops and some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("aurora-born heroes") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The pendant as emotional conduit and the "fade from memory to myth" timeframe offer fresh angles. The shepherd transformation feels earned. However, the mentor-legacy plot follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
