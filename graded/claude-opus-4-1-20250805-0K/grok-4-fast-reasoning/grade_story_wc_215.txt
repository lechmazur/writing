<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's tranquil perceptiveness drives concrete micro-choices throughout (tracing patterns, handling the box, choosing silence over speech), with his astonishment at the ghosts creating genuine internal tension. The final choice to preserve rather than speak shows clear motivation with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract interiority ("profound unraveling") and limited embodied emotion during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's traced gesture realigns the covenant. The ghosts' visibility creates the inciting pressure, and the stained glass box discovery provides meaningful escalation. Closure lands with felt cost as "the oasis breathed, a faint hum rising." Minor deduction for slightly abstract covenant mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wasteland setting actively constrains choices (abandoned hives, cracked earth, sand-buried tower), while the stained glass box serves as micro-setting that enables resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sky bled orange," "faint hum rising"). The oasis's physical decay mirrors the covenant's deterioration, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the covenant's silent weight) established early and tightens when the box reveals the tangled threads. Elias's agency drives the resolution through deliberate gesture rather than speech. Cost is visible in the ghosts' transformation and the oasis's response, though the pressure could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between speech and silence, with the covenant's corruption shown through glass facets rather than stated. The final gesture that preserves "mute eloquence" offers a non-literal answer to whether broken promises can be honored without words. Subtext operates strongly in Elias's choice to trace rather than speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature (Elias notices "subtle shifts," "contextual clues"). Prose texture matches the tranquil, observant character. Some elevated diction ("mute eloquence," "spectral chaos") occasionally drifts from the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ethereal forms flickering into view like mirages given form") and some abstract phrasing that reduces immediacy ("profound unraveling").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The covenant-as-physical-threads concept offers a fresh angle on broken promises, with the stained glass box as an original resolution mechanism. The synthesis of beekeeping, ghosts, and unspoken vows feels organic. Specific details like "honey to the earth" pledges avoid generic ghost story tropes.</comment>
