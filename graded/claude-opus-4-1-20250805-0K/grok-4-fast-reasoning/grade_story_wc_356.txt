<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to master remedies and cultivate serenity is clear and consistent, with her olfactory sensitivity creating genuine struggle when confronting the corpse flower. However, the transformation from overwhelm to embrace feels somewhat rushed in the final beat, and internal contradiction operates more through summary ("doubts flickered") than simultaneous impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the corpse flower's bloom as the "turning of the tide's thought." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms the flower's assault into wisdom about "serenity in motion," though the cost—while conceptually stated—lacks sufficient embodied weight on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The treetop village setting is vividly rendered with "walkways of woven vines" and "hollowed trunk basin," creating authentic constraint. The corpse flower's overwhelming scent directly shapes Elara's final choice, satisfying the environment-constrains-choice test for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mastering the corpse flower to help village elders—escalates when the bloom's "rot-scent clawed at her senses." However, the resolution through journalizing feels insufficiently costly; the transformation from "visceral assault" to teaching moment needs more embodied struggle to justify the claimed serenity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding "serenity within motion" emerges organically through Elara's struggle with the overwhelming flower. The journalizing on wrapping papers provides concrete imagery for processing chaos, though the final insight about "embrace" versus "escape" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with rich perceptual detail ("sharp tang of pine resin"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("liminal hour when day exhaled into dusk") that strains against the herbalist POV, and some passages feel more like lyrical description than character-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades key beats: "colossal oaks intertwined like ancient lovers," "dark sunrise," "symphony she danced within." Template cadence appears in "As days blurred...Elara prepared...The treetop world moved on." The prose prioritizes ornamental description over propulsion, with multiple paraphrase loops around the same concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of an olfactorily-sensitive herbalist confronting a corpse flower offers inherent tension. However, execution relies on familiar tropes (mystical village, sacred moments, journey to wisdom) without sufficient transformation, and the resolution through art-journaling feels conceptually tidy rather than emotionally specific.</comment>
