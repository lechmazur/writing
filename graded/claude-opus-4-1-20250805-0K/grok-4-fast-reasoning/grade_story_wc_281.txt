I'll evaluate this story under a Causal drive lens, as the narrative progresses through because/therefore linkages from the static shock to the couple's discovery of non-telepathic connection.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "affectionate skeptic" nature manifests concretely through physical gestures paired with verbal doubt, and Theo's vulnerability about the telepathy pill creates genuine tension. The characters' opposing stances on connection methods drive meaningful conflict, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("where skepticism warred with longing").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the couple discovering somatic connection as replacement for telepathic pills, with visible cost in Theo's abandoned pharmaceutical pursuit. Causality flows cleanly from shock to awareness to artistic experiment, though the transition from problem to solution feels slightly rushed in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The light painting studio constrains choices effectively—the exposure timer enforces sustained physical contact, the geode refracts light into emotional patterns, and the developing process reveals hidden connections. The muscovite sliver's "fractally precise" layers mirror the relationship's complexity and actively shapes the final artwork.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Theo's pill disappointment through Elara's proposed alternative to their successful somatic mapping experiment. The tightening occurs when they must maintain physical synchronization during the long exposure, though the lack of real opposition or failure risk keeps tension moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the contrast between artificial (pills) and embodied (somatic) connection, with the geode's fractal patterns reflecting emotional complexity. The ending image of "somatic truths and fractal beauty" resonates without moralizing, though "willowglass hope" occasionally veers toward precious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third focalization through Elara with controlled psychic distance shifts during the exposure sequence. Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("fractally precise rainbows that splintered"), and occasional filter verb clusters slow immediacy ("She'd read about them").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("trails of colored LEDs danced across canvas like fireflies in a jar") but suffers from scattered template phrases and mild overwriting. Several paraphrase loops appear ("somatic awareness, those subtle bodily signals") and register occasionally drifts academic, dulling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The somatic markers concept offers a fresh, embodied alternative to telepathic connection tropes, grounded in neuroscience vocabulary. The light painting medium provides unique visual metaphor for emotional mapping, though some elements feel assembled rather than fully synthesized.</comment>
