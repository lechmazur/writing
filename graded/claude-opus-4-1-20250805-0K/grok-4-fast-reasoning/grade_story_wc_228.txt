<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in grief/nostalgia, with concrete embodiment in the cave descent and shell painting. The "intimately aloof" trait manifests consistently through his guarded nature and private vow. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneity—his choices feel sequential rather than torn—and the final renunciation/acceptance lacks sufficient dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through discovery of the oasis and shell painting as closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the painted shell becoming talisman and inspiration, with cost visible in "temporary eternities glimpsed and lost." Who/where/when anchored early. Causality holds but the "wrong turn" convenience and lack of concrete obstacle weakens escalation linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory work in the oasis discovery—crystalline pool, sea thrift, aquamarine hues—with setting constraining choice through the narrowing passage and fading skylight. The cave network and hidden sanctuary directly shape Elias's final act of painting the shell. Minor deduction for some purple prose ("pocket of eternity") but overall setting drives the closure image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming lost world/fulfilling vow) signaled early and deepens through oasis discovery. The tightening comes through fading skylight creating urgency, but lacks concrete opposition or trade-off. The "wrong turn" feels convenient rather than earned, and no meaningful option is foreclosed with visible price—the shell painting succeeds without cost beyond acknowledging temporariness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically through the oasis discovery and shell painting, with the final image of "canvases that captured...the ache of temporary eternities" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The shell-as-talisman motif effectively constrains and charges closure. Slight deduction for "I carry the quay eternal" approaching theme statement, but overall subtext operates well through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with selective nostalgic focus and painterly attention to color/light throughout. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent during cave descent. Minor filter-verb cluster ("he felt a pull," "he realized," "he knew") in middle section reduces immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. POV distance stable with clean free indirect style.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, particularly strong in oasis description. However, multiple text artifacts reduce score: paraphrase loop ("temporary eternity"/"temporary eternities"), register drift into elevated diction ("intimately aloof no longer just to others but to his own unraveling"), and some purple prose ("pocket of eternity," "soul suspended"). Template cadence in "He knelt...he lifted...he unpacked" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, art, and place through the painted seashell as vessel for memory. The hidden oasis discovery and act of painting natural object with personal harbor scenes offers non-obvious angle. Some derivative elements (artist processing grief through art) but transformed through specific coastal cave setting and the temporary/eternal tension.</comment>
