<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's blindness creates authentic constraints that shape his repair methods, and his devotion manifests through concrete sensory navigation. The motivation to "decode feedback into direction" drives tangible choices, though the emotional arc would benefit from more internal contradiction during the repair sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the repaired drone carries "mended hope into the world," with visible cost in Elias's scarred hands and years of loss. The water refraction method pays off the blindness constraint meaningfully, though the Elysium's departure feels somewhat ornamental to the core repair arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The depot setting constrains action beautifully through mist, water features, and light refraction that become essential to the blind repair method. Sensory hierarchy privileges touch and sound over sight, creating a lived-in industrial atmosphere where "iron tracks kissed the edge of a restless harbor."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the drone's guidance capability—progresses through discovery of misalignment to successful repair, with cost visible in Elias's scarred dedication. However, escalation remains gentle without meaningful resistance or complication to the repair process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of guidance despite blindness emerges organically through the water-refraction repair method and the drone's purpose to "scout paths through fog-shrouded routes." The final image of the drone as "a jewel in the calm dawn" reweights Elias's role as one who enables others' journeys.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "heartfelt artisan" and "magnetic calm," though occasional overwriting ("jewel in the calm dawn") slightly dulls impact. POV control remains stable with no head-hopping, and Elias's blindness appropriately limits perceptual access.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("iron tracks kissed the edge of a restless harbor") but suffers from occasional purple patches and the meta-commentary about word count that breaks immersion. Some metaphors strain ("whisper of his soul poured into steel"), though overall clarity remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blind artisan using water refraction to repair offers a fresh angle on the repair-shop trope, and the specific method feels inventive. However, the emotional arc follows expected beats without surprising transformation.</comment>
