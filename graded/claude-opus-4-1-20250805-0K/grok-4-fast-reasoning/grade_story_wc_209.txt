<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's quiet obsession with understanding nocturnal blooms creates consistent motivation, and her final realization connects grandmother's hidden love to her own artistic practice with earned resonance. However, interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("gentle obsession that whispered," "riddle of the heart") rather than embodied contradiction, and the emotional progression from seeking to understanding lacks intermediate struggle or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through postcards, cathedral visits, and gradual revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara understands both her grandmother's life and her own artistic drive. The closure lands with emotional cost ("tears blurred the glass") and transformed understanding, though the accumulation could benefit from more resistance or complication in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window function as active constraints that shape Elara's investigation, with the etched glass layers revealing meaning only through specific light angles—a strong marriage of setting and discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("amber hues dominated," "frost-laced spires"), and the melting snow provides temporal pressure that mirrors the gradual revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—develops through accumulative discovery rather than escalating conflict, with the cathedral window revelation providing the key deepening moment. While cost emerges at closure through tears and emotional recognition, the middle lacks active resistance or meaningful obstacles that would force trade-offs or narrow options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central metaphor of nocturnal blooms as hidden defiance elegantly unifies grandmother's secret depths with Elara's shadow-corner murals, emerging through concrete discovery rather than assertion. The final image of Elara stepping out with "quiet drive now a blooming certainty" resonantly reweights the opening without explicit moralizing, though some phrasing ("riddle of the heart") edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, shadow, and artistic detail. Voice modulates effectively between contemplative observation and emotional revelation, though some passages drift into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "vaulted stone") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with most sentences advancing multiple purposes, and the prose avoids major loops or scaffolding. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("gentle obsession that whispered," "umbral tenderness") and repetitive descriptors for the amber light reduce precision, while filter constructions ("she felt the pull") occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of family mystery, artistic drive, and botanical metaphor creates a cohesive vision that avoids generic templates through specific details like the etched cathedral glass revealing patterns only in certain light. While the night-blooming flowers metaphor itself is somewhat familiar, its integration with grandmother's postcards and Elara's mural art provides fresh context.</comment>
