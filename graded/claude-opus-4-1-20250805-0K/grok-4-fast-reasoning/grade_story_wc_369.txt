<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's methodical progression from mundane labyrinth maintenance to mystical revelation shows consistent motivation rooted in his obsession with the trees' witness. His micro-choice to map dreams onto the sextant reveals character-specific problem-solving, though some introspection borders on over-articulation ("quantified sorrow—each fracture marking degrees of loss"). The final transformation earns its cost through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's "deconstruction had unlocked the trees' silent testimony." The sextant's healing under moonlight creates a clear before/after with felt cost ("sorrows blooming into constellations of resilience"). Minor orientation delays (tower's exact nature unclear early) don't compromise the strong closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth tower setting constrains through its "twisting corridors" and "deceptive doorways," while moonlight enables the sextant's healing—environment directly shapes the resolution. Vivid sensory work ("moonlight pooled like spilled mercury") and the trees as witness-setting elevate atmosphere, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("thunder grumbled like a distant confession").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elias's need to understand "what those sentinel trees witness," with escalation through his discovery and reconstruction of the sextant. The pin-drop moment provides meaningful deepening that changes his understanding. Cost appears in "sorrows tallied like nautical miles" though agency could be stronger—much happens through mystical confluence rather than decisive choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the sextant as "relic of quantified sorrow" transforms into tool for witnessing "constellations of resilience." The final image of binding "human longing to the world's quiet wonders" resonates without moralizing. Some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("mundane miracles") but mostly earn their weight through dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with character-specific perception ("like roots of the great oaks"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("stellar parallax," "angular deviations") though it mostly serves the astronomer-maintenance worker hybrid perspective. No dialogue to evaluate; internal focalization stays controlled despite occasional filter-verb clustering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, but figurative density overwhelms in places—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or simile. Template cadence appears ("Elias lifted...Elias carried...Elias sketched...Elias saw...Elias smiled"). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("moonlight slicing through roiling clouds") but overwriting diminishes momentum, particularly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fusion of labyrinth maintenance with astronomical mysticism offers fresh angle, and "mapping scattered dreams" onto broken instruments shows originality. The trees-as-witnesses concept transforms familiar elements. Some phrases echo workshop prose ("fractured sky," "silent vigils") and the resolution's neatness reduces risk-taking potential.</comment>
