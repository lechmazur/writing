<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven transformation from despair to teaching renewal is well-motivated with concrete embodied emotion ("hands trembled," "grief-worn skin"). The final choice to help Lira while simultaneously healing herself shows genuine internal contradiction resolved through action. Deductions for occasional therapy-speak ("yearned to teach others—and herself—to wither no more") and some emotional summary rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara finds renewal through teaching another. The observatory's time-bending properties and the discovery of the vellum stencil build toward the final scene where helping Lira transforms both women. Cost is visible in tears and "grief softening." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the observatory's nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The timeless observatory functions as micro-setting that enables the story's resolution—its perpetual twilight and bent time allow for the healing work. Vivid sensory detail ("cold against her grief-worn skin," "air hummed with subdued ardor") filtered through Elara's craftsperson POV. The vellum and origami figures constrain choices and charge the final image of shared renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of overcoming grief escalates from rock bottom through discovery of the vellum to actively helping Lira, with each stage narrowing Elara's options toward engagement. The final "illumination" of Lira's curtains of intention demonstrates meaningful deepening. Slight deduction for the resolution depending partially on Lira's arrival rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through shared suffering emerges organically from concrete actions—crafting mourning jewelry, discovering the stencil, creating origami guides. The "curtains of intention" concept integrates meaningfully as both metaphor and plot mechanism. Final image of their "shared, subdued ardor" resonantly answers the question of how one moves past devastating loss without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction appropriate to the otherworldly setting ("spectral visitors," "ethereal veils"). Clean third-person limited POV maintained throughout with appropriate psychic distance shifts. Some register elevation in peak moments ("cosmic dust," "resilience") slightly strains the craftsperson's lexicon but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, especially in descriptive passages. Deductions for multiple paraphrase loops ("mourning jewelry—lockets etched with wilted roses and shadowed cameos—taking shape" restates prior information) and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("curtains of intention, ethereal veils woven from starlight and will"). Template cadence in the Lira sequence ("Lira approached...Elara watched...Lira unfolded").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeless observatory as a space where grief can be processed outside normal time offers a fresh angle on loss and healing. The synthesis of astronomy, craft, and mourning through the origami-coordinate system is specific and non-obvious. The vellum stencil that bridges "the ephemeral and the eternal" provides genuine conceptual innovation.</comment>
