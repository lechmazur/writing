<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from dramatic sensationalist to humble observer is earned through concrete experience with butterfly dust patterns, though internal conflict could be more embodied in peak moments. Her motivation crystallizes through specific micro-choices (collecting dust, mapping patterns, releasing butterflies) with visible cost (lost career, flooded home).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns gradually reweight Elara's understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases butterflies and commits to "unadorned" research. Cost is visible (career destroyed, home lost) but the final equations sketch feels slightly abstract compared to the embodied middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices effectively—shattered glass, brackish water, and salvaged equipment shape Elara's makeshift laboratory. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("glittered like fallen stars"), though the final third shifts toward abstraction rather than maintaining tactile grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stripping drama from scientific observation) deepens through dust pattern accumulation, with one meaningful turn when patterns overlay perfectly with neutron star data. Escalation is present but agency feels slightly passive in places—Elara observes more than decides, though her final choice to release butterflies carries weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between greenhouse decay and stellar erosion, avoiding explicit moralizing until "her pursuit felt authentic." The butterfly dust preprocessing reality becomes a non-literal answer to seeing truth without imposed drama, though "patient rhythm" edges toward stating rather than showing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains scientific precision ("chitinous nanostructures," "osmotic pressure") appropriate to POV, with controlled modulation during emotional peaks. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal focalization stays consistent without head-hopping, and perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("gradual change" appears 3x, "needless drama" 3x, "humility kindling" 2x). Template cadence emerges in middle ("Day by day...layer by layer") and filter-verb clustering appears ("she saw," "she felt," "she spent hours"). Information density is moderate but repetitive phrasing dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lepidopteran biology with neutron star research offers a non-obvious angle, and the parallel between macro/micro decay feels earned. However, the scientist-finds-meaning-in-nature-after-disaster frame is somewhat familiar, elevated by specific technical detail but not fully transformed.</comment>
