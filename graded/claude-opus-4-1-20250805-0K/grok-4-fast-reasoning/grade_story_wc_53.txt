I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for literary excellence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between eroded ambitions and determination reads authentically through concrete embodiment ("calloused hands gripping the splintered wood"). The ghost negotiation crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "hollow ache" and "spectral remnants" that could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's negotiation with her ghost transforms regret into "a new, still narrative" with clear cost (accepting the erosion of ambitions). The accumulative lens holds as fragments build toward this reconfiguration. Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of the ghost negotiation prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon's physics ("droplets hung mid-air like suspended regrets") constrains movement and charges the final negotiation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtering through Elara's scavenger perspective. The halted carousel's transformation from motion to stillness mirrors the thematic arc effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting past choices escalates through fragment collection to ghost negotiation, with visible cost in accepting erosion. The tightening from passive regret to active bargaining forecloses the path of recapturing lost potential. Pressure could intensify more sharply in the middle section where fragment collection feels somewhat mechanical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of eroded ambitions and halted motion, avoiding direct moralizing. The fragments' whispered stories ("I spun away, but the music never stopped") create resonant parallels without heavy-handedness. Final image of the ghost "fading into mist" offers non-literal resolution to the question of negotiating with past selves.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fractured stillness," "kinetic flow"). Some register elevation in phrases like "spectral remnants" and "translucent version" slightly exceeds the scavenger POV's established lexicon. Perceptual signature strongest when focusing on physical fragments and weakest in abstract reflection passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but moderate overwriting in figurative density ("droplets hung mid-air like suspended regrets," "whispers that carried snippets"). Template cadence appears in fragment collection sequence ("One fragment...Another..."). Information density is good but some paraphrase loops around the erosion concept reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carousel-as-temporal-trap with scavenger-negotiating-ghost creates non-obvious angle on regret. The halted kinetic lagoon above clouds offers genuinely original worldbuilding. Transformation of disposable camera wheel from capture device to lost potential shows ingenuity, though some elements feel slightly overworked.</comment>
