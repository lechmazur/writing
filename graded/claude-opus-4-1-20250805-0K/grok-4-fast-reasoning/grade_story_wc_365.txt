I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Elara discovers the truth about her mentor through parallel universe exploration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices through the multiverse exploration. The internal conflict between pursuing truth and bearing its weight creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression through the parallel universes feels somewhat rushed, and the revelation about the mentor's sacrifice, while poignant, could use more embodied reaction beyond tears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage throughout with clear closure - Elara discovers the withheld truth and accepts its weight, choosing to "map responsibly." The Decisive Change lands with visible cost as she understands her mentor's sacrifice. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs, and the drive lens holds consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting effectively constrains choices and provides the green glass shard as a crucial tool. Sensory details like "metallic tang of recycled air" and "phantom vibration of docking clamps" ground the parallel universe shifts. The setting actively participates in the closure as Elara begins her new chart in the same bay, now transformed by knowledge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal curiosity to understanding cosmic consequences. The tightening occurs when Elara discovers "each crossing added weight, a cumulative burden that could collapse realities." This revelation forces her final choice to map responsibly, with clear cost visible in her tears and the felt weight of truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of bearing truth's weight and the responsibility that comes with power. The mentor's sacrifice embodies the theme without stating it explicitly. The final image of Elara beginning her next chart "cyclically spontaneous and forever changed" resonates thematically, though the transformation could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with appropriate technical vocabulary for a "sensory map maker." The perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences the multiverse through sensory threads. Some phrases like "dream-murmur" effectively capture her unique perception, though occasional elevated diction ("cosmic debt pressing through the parallels") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally flows well with varied sentence structures and clear imagery. However, some repetitive phrasing appears ("cyclically spontaneous" used 6 times, "dream-murmur" 4 times) that could be varied. The opening and closing lines effectively bracket the story, though some middle sections contain slight redundancy in describing the parallel universes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of a sensory map maker navigating parallel universes offers a fresh angle on multiverse fiction. The specific detail of mapping through "touch, scent, and echo" distinguishes this from generic portal fantasy. However, the mentor's sacrifice to protect others from cosmic weight feels somewhat familiar, preventing higher originality scores.</comment>
