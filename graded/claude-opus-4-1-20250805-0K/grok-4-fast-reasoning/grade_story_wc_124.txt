<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation coheres beautifully through his aromatically cautious nature and suppressed grief over his wife's death by rogue fragrance. The final choice to grieve openly without restraint represents earned catharsis, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("gnawing motivation to understand why some smells triggered tears"). Internal contradiction plays effectively as he battles professional caution against personal need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost—Elias finally grieves openly after understanding that "some scents wept for us." The causal chain from perfume vial to UV revelation to holographic projection of Elara's peace holds logically. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (greenhouse purpose emerges gradually) and the conceptual explanation becoming somewhat abstract in the final lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting brilliantly constrains and enables—the UV lights reveal hidden truths, the extinct plants mirror loss, the bioluminescent pod provides the transformation catalyst. Sensory detail excels ("humid air laced with faint, ghostly fragrances"). The crystalline panes' frost-veins and the pod's pulsing threads create vivid specificity that charges the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding olfactory grief while risking emotional overwhelm—builds through Elias's cautious approach, the timed UV revelation, and the climactic scent release. The escalation from professional distance to personal vulnerability works, though the holographic projection feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior pressure. Cost is visible in his collapse to his knees.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of extinction/revival, memory/loss, and professional/personal boundaries. The final insight about scents as "bridges to the raw essence of loss" resonates without moralizing. The recurring crystal shadows and UV revelation create meaningful pattern. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract articulation of theme in the penultimate sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains literary elevation with controlled rhythm ("hushed embrace," "crystalline panes etched with frost-like veins"). The perceptual signature—Elias seeing through his trade's lens of captured scents and contained potency—remains consistent. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to deep interiority during the climax. Minor register elevation in places but voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and rich information density. Some overwriting appears ("gnawing motivation," "spectral signatures") but doesn't obscure clarity. The final sentence's multiple participial phrases create slight awkwardness. Generally strong rhythm and momentum, with effective use of specific technical language (bioluminescent threads, ultraviolet revealing).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct plant greenhouse with lantern broker who captures scents offers genuine freshness. The specific detail of holographic memory projections under UV light transcends typical grief narratives. The transformation of professional caution into personal catharsis through olfactory science creates non-obvious emotional territory, though the convenience of the holographic revelation slightly undermines full originality.</comment>
