<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's guilt-driven motivation is clear and her "heuristically gentle" gardening approach embodies character through action. However, abstract philosophizing about "creeping normality" occasionally replaces embodied emotion, and the internal conflict could sharpen in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative lens, the piece builds through layered acts toward Earned Stasis—Elara finding peace while accepting guilt's weight. The closure lands with subtle cost, though it could be more visceral at "she had found her peace."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and hidden tea house create atmospheric constraint that shapes Elara's choices. Selective sensory work ("bread's crumbs on her lapel," "steam curling like secrets") effectively filters through POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of seeking "tenuous absolution" accumulates pressure through restoration acts, appropriate for the reflective tone. However, the gentle escalation lacks the decisive tightening that would elevate the score under this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through guerrilla gardening as quiet rebellion and bread ritual as communion. The ending's "vigil against the fade" offers resonant answer without moral statement, though passages like "seeking the sacred in the ordinary" edge toward abstract declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with distinctive phrases like "colors leaching away like ink in rain." However, elevated diction ("tenuous absolution," "heuristically gentle") feels prompt-imposed rather than organic to Elara's voice, especially the verbatim repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but "heuristically gentle" appears twice verbatim and some overwriting occurs ("morning mist," "skittish child"). Abstract philosophizing about normality could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening as redemptive practice offers fresh angle, and the secret tea house sanctuary is evocative. However, the philosophical framing reads as safely literary rather than taking genuine risks with form or perspective.</comment>
