<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Herald's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives consistent action, but his characterization relies heavily on mythic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The accidental prophecies create some internal tension, yet his "shadowed elation" remains more labeled than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the Herald's routine building toward a Conceptual Repricing where his obsolescence becomes the cost of renewal. However, the closure's cost ("his own form fading") appears only in vision rather than dramatized action, and the piece lacks clear orientation anchors for who/what the Herald actually is until too late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse and its glass lantern wick constrain the Herald's actions through "total internal reflection" mechanics, making setting functional rather than ornamental. Sensory detail focuses on the visual ("verdant glow," "frozen bolt of lightning") with some tactile elements, though the post-newspaper world remains more conceptual than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—birthing renewal through ancient shadows—coheres but never truly tightens since the Herald faces no opposition beyond his own visions. The prophetic glimpse of his obsolescence creates mild tension, yet this arrives late and resolves too easily with his immediate acceptance rather than genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of cyclical renewal through obsolescence emerges organically from the Herald's actions, particularly in the resonant final image of him extinguishing the wick to "await the next cycle." The integration of old (ancient shadows, print newspapers) with new (digital ghosts, algorithms) creates thematic texture, though some passages veer toward abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mythic register maintains consistency but creates distance that prevents intimate access to the Herald's interiority. Phrases like "shadowed elation" and "tempests incarnate" establish atmosphere but the elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than illuminates, particularly when describing the wick's mechanics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("salt-kissed winds," "frozen bolt of lightning," "serpents in the night") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly around the shadow-steering sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of a mythic figure tending an otherworldly lighthouse after newspapers' extinction offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of ancient storm-heraldry with post-information-age renewal creates an original angle, though execution sometimes retreats into generic mythic language rather than mining the premise's full specificity.</comment>
