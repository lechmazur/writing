<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's "cautious exuberance" drives meaningful choices through the ink ritual, though her internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied rather than labeled. The trust restoration arc lands with visible cost in renewed partnership, but Thorne remains somewhat passive after his initial skepticism cracks. The final choice to bind through magical promises shows character-specific agency, yet peak emotional states rely on abstractions ("hope tempered by fear") rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands cleanly—trust literally reconstituted through magical binding with visible cost of vulnerability. The accumulative/textural lens holds as glyphs build into symphony, with each promise adding harmonic weight. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the single-scene structure maintains unity. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract ("promises to share dangers") rather than showing specific sacrifice, limiting entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive setting actively constrains choice through the magical properties of ink and glyphs, with "shelves groaning under volumes" creating atmospheric pressure. The glass inkwell functions as micro-setting that enables the central action. Sensory detail privileges sound ("low vibration," "harmonious hum") appropriately for the symphony concept. The setting's magical rules remain consistent and shape tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of trust restoration signals early and tightens once when Thorne's skepticism "cracks like thin ice." Agency manifests through Elara's choice to risk vulnerability via the magical binding. However, escalation relies heavily on accumulating glyphs rather than genuine reversals or deepening complications—the ritual proceeds smoothly once begun. Cost remains somewhat abstract ("promises," "vows") rather than showing concrete sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The symphony-as-truth concept emerges organically through the magical system rather than stated themes. The final binding offers a non-literal answer about trust requiring mutual vulnerability. However, theme tends toward the explicit with phrases like "trust restored in this fragile harmony" that summarize rather than resonate. Subtext operates better in Thorne's initial crossed arms and gradual softening than in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with arcane-scholarly register ("vaulted halls," "iridescence of deciphered runes") that fits the linguist POV. Focalization stays cleanly with Elara throughout, tracking her perceptions of Thorne's reactions. Dialogue differentiates adequately—Elara's formal proposals versus Thorne's rougher "I promise to hear you out." Some filter-verb clustering ("felt the urgency," "glanced at him") dulls immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dust motes danced like forgotten syllables") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract emotional labeling. Template cadence appears in "She [verb], She [verb]" patterns across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops emerge with "restore that trust, to mend what the quiet had torn" restating the same concept. The final paragraph's "trust restored...ready to face whatever lay beyond together" explicitly summarizes rather than trusting the dramatization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The magic-as-language system offers modest freshness through the symphony metaphor, though "magical promises restore trust" follows familiar patterns. Specificity in "Eldari script" and the glass inkwell's "swirling glyphs" provides texture. The emotional arc of partnership renewal through vulnerability reads as genuine but not particularly surprising. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't transform expectations significantly.</comment>
