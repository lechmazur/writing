I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds density through layered imagery and metaphysical concepts, with the lens reconstruction serving as both literal and symbolic accumulation toward the final stasis.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and undertaker identity effectively motivate his pursuit of permanent rest, with his stubbornness emerging naturally through action rather than declaration. The transformation from seeking solitude to actively guiding souls shows genuine character movement with visible cost—his splitting across impossible spaces.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias achieves the "chased stillness" through self-sacrifice, joining the quiet he pursued. The accumulative lens holds as souls gather, lens shards unite, and density increases toward the earned stasis, though the "impossible spaces" mechanism could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater library setting excellently constrains choices—the bioluminescent glow, barnacle-encrusted tomes, and impossible geometric spaces all function as active elements shaping Elias's tactics. The environment enables the solution through its paradoxical architecture where "time folded upon itself."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully from personal rest-seeking to collective soul-saving, with Elias's blood sacrifice and bodily splitting showing clear cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as distress signals intensify into coherent beams, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of finding rest by embracing unrest, with the lighthouse lens serving as both literal tool and metaphor for guidance. The final image of Elias joining "the hush he had so long pursued" resonantly reweights the entire quest without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the otherworldly setting—"sand through skeletal fingers," "faulty beacons." The perceptual signature maintains consistency through stress, though occasional elevated diction ("bifurcated state") slightly strains the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative imagery, but some redundancy appears: "weary"/"weariness" repetition, and the "chased stillness" concept restated multiple times. The phrase "inadvertently stubborn" feels forced into the narrative. Information density is high in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-lighthouse-keeper and underwater Atlantis setting creates genuine originality. The impossible spaces concept and soul-archiving in waterlogged books show imaginative risk-taking, though the mystical resolution trends slightly toward familiar territory.</comment>
