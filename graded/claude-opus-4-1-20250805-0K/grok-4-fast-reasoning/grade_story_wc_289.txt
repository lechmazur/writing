<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a ghostwriter who has lost her own connection is clear and drives her journey to the temple. Her internal state is well-embodied through concrete details like "heart felt adrift, severed from the thread that connects all things." The transformation from isolation to connection is earned through the discovered letter and reunion, with visible emotional cost in "tears blurred the prismatic quiet."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery of spirals, threads, and connections. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transitions from "keeper of secrets" to "part of the kept," with emotional cost visible in her tears and the reweighting of her ghostwriting work. The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond create atmospheric pressure through prismatic imagery and rain-washed textures. The thrush's nest installation functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when Elara discovers the letter wedged in its base. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "mist that refracted sunlight into soft rainbows" serves the prismatic motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's disconnection from "the thread that connects all things"—is signaled early and deepens when she discovers Liora's letter addressed to her. The tightening occurs when the installation reveals itself as built from donated letters including Elara's work, forcing recognition of her impact. Cost is visible in emotional release and the foreclosure of her isolated path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of threads, nests, and spirals rather than abstract statements. The concept of hidden connections becoming public art resonates through specific details like "each twig a fragment of a bird's hidden life, now woven publicly." The ending reweights Elara's ghostwriting from isolation to connection without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in phrases like "the prismatic quiet that followed the cloud bursts." POV remains stable in limited third without head-hopping. Some elevated diction ("inevitably whimsical energy") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the atmospheric intent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like the opening's vivid imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "prismatic quiet" (appears 3 times) and "thread that connects all things" (appears 3 times). Some sentences reach for elevated register that dulls momentum: "inevitably whimsical energy, as if the lilies themselves conspired in gentle jests." Information density is moderate with some redundant emotional labeling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a ghostwriter finding her own lost letter transformed into public art offers a fresh angle on connection themes. The spiral installation as repository of global love letters shows originality. However, the resolution tends toward expected emotional satisfaction without surprising complications.</comment>
