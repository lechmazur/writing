<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's spiritually curious nature and vulnerability drive consistent choices, but his transformation lacks embodied emotional contradiction in scene—the epiphany about "flourishing stillness" arrives through abstract realization rather than dramatized struggle. The final stance crystallization has conceptual weight but minimal felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through cosmic imagery, but closure arrives as philosophical insight ("flourishing stillness") without visible cost or foreclosed path. The yellow lantern glass discovery creates texture but doesn't meaningfully tighten options or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cosmic setting effectively frames isolation and scale, with the station's "dim corridors" and "viewing dome" providing spatial anchoring. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final meditation, though environmental constraints don't actively shape Elias's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—remains abstract throughout, with no concrete pressure forcing Elias to choose between options. The meteor shower and glass discovery add texture but don't escalate toward a meaningful tightening; the resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges through accumulated imagery of falling stars "shedding celestial skin," though it tends toward direct statement ("In your fall, you teach me to stand still"). The final reconfiguration from janitor to "guardian of vulnerabilities" offers resonance but lacks the specificity that would elevate beyond conceptual assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The elevated prose maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things poetically ("primal grace," "elegant blades") rather than through character-specific filters. Multiple register drifts into abstract philosophy ("flourishing stillness," "vulnerable rebirth") disconnect from a cosmic janitor's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting weighs down momentum: "sentinel carved from stardust and silence," "luminous rebels streaking across the void," "elegant blades of forgotten light." Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("feeling the stars' terror and triumph, their plunge not an end but..."). The prose prioritizes ornamental metaphor over narrative propulsion, with nearly every sentence carrying figurative language that doesn't accumulate pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor frame offers modest freshness, and the concept of stars finding strength through falling has poetic appeal. However, the execution relies heavily on abstract meditation rather than specific dramatized discovery, and the transformation reads as philosophical insight rather than earned through particular struggle.</comment>
