<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to give voice to the voiceless is clear and consistent, driving her to transform the ghost's code into art. The character demonstrates embodied action through her physical creation of murals, though internal contradiction remains minimal. Her transformation from "seldom-heard" to finally heard provides earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elowen's liberation of the ghost and her own voice being "finally heard by the winds." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the ghost's release. Cost is legible through the "articulated needs" of lost creators and Elowen's evolution from isolation to connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting actively constrains and enables choice—the stone walls become Elowen's canvas, the cloud-blossoms provide pigment. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she moves through fog to walls to central mural. The atmospheric details of mist and approaching storm charge the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating the ghost's trapped voice—is signaled early through the flower press discovery. Escalation occurs through Elowen's progressive actions: finding, understanding, then translating the ghost into art. The tightening timeframe "between lightning and thunder" creates pressure that forces decisive action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of translating code into art, avoiding abstract statements about creativity or connection. The final image of the freed ghost and transformed courtyard offers a non-literal answer about giving voice to the silenced. Subtext operates through the parallel between Elowen's seldom-heard voice and the ghost's encoded pleas.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical diction appropriate to the fantastical setting ("luminous wisp," "tinkersong wonder"). POV remains stable in limited third-person without head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into overly ornate territory ("spectral intelligence woven into the binary veins") that strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and visual paragraph breaks, avoiding monotony. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously. Overwriting appears in peak moments ("binary blooms that hid pleas for connection") with −0.5 for density; template cadence emerges in "She... She... Her fingers..." sequence with −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-in-code with graffiti art as translation method offers genuine originality. The specific detail of using cloud-blossom pigments and the timeframe constraint between lightning and thunder creates memorable particulars. The transformation of both artist and ghost through creative act avoids template resolution.</comment>
