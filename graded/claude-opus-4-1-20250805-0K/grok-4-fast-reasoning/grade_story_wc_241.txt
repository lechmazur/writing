<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between theoretical rebellion and responsibility drives genuine complexity, particularly in how she interprets her father's gambling as "lucid contradictions" rather than simple vice. The embodied grief through "clover-scented melancholy" and physical interaction with artifacts avoids emotional abstraction. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("widening perspectives") that echoes the prompt language rather than emerging organically from character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms grief into understanding, with visible emotional cost ("Tears welled"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of scrawls building toward revelation. Deduction for orientation softness—the subway scene relationship to present action remains somewhat unclear—and for cost that feels more stated than dramatized in the final movement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rainwashed library creates genuine atmosphere through sensory layering (damp stone, blooming clover, wooden shelves "bowed like weary guardians"). The mica pane lantern constrains how Elara perceives the scrawls, making environment functional rather than decorative. The setting actively shapes her interpretive process and emotional state through concrete details.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's need to understand her father's contradictions, with modest tightening as each scrawl deepens her perspective. The escalation follows an accumulative pattern appropriate to the textural lens, though pressure remains primarily internal without external complication. Cost registers emotionally but lacks the sharpness needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the concept of "lucid contradictions"—probability containing both control and chaos. The scrawls function as concrete vehicles for abstract ideas about certainty/uncertainty. Minor deduction for occasional thematic echo in phrases like "widening perspectives" that feel prompt-derived rather than scene-earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to an academic's daughter, with selective perception shaped by grief and intellectual habit. The cryptic scrawls are rendered with distinct texture ("The die rolls true in false light"). Deduction for some register drift into overly abstract phrasing during emotional peaks that distances rather than intensifies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rainwashed library," "clover melancholy") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence carries metaphorical weight without sufficient breathing room. Template cadence appears in the scrawl interpretation sequence ("Next marking...It mirrored..."). Some paraphrase loops around the father's contradictions reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subway scrawls as cryptic wisdom offers a fresh angle on grief processing, avoiding typical flashback structure. The synthesis of probability theory with gambling addiction through "lucid contradictions" shows genuine ingenuity. Modest deduction for safety in emotional resolution—the ending chooses understanding over more complex unresolved grief.</comment>
