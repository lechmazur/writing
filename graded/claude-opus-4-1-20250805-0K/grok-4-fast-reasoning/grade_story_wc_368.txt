<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from watchful guardian to story-magnetizer is well-motivated through the donor heart device, with concrete embodied details like "the donor heart quickened, syncing with the wing's gleam." The internal contradiction between caution and magnetism acts effectively in scene, particularly in the wing examination sequence. However, the epiphany about magnetizing stories arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient prior struggle, and the resolution feels slightly too neat for the complexity established.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara stepping "toward the edge, the mist parting like a story yielding to its teller" with clear cost (abandoning protective caution). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphors build toward the final transformation. The orientation anchors (valley, tea house, dye master) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "magnetizing stories" which could be more concretely dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house setting directly constrains and enables Elara's transformation—its suspended position allows sun-tracking while creating physical distance for contemplation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("petrified fern," "thermal currents," "prismatic patterns"). The wing functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Setting evolution from misty isolation to mist "parting like a story" effectively mirrors internal change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding story magnetism deepens through the wing examination, moving from question to embodied realization to action. Escalation occurs through the sun-tracking sequence where light reveals "hidden veins" and triggers donor memories, forcing Elara to confront her cautious nature. Cost is visible in abandoning protective walls. However, the conflict lacks external pressure—everything unfolds internally without meaningful opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of iridescent caution—"beautiful yet brittle"—which accumulates meaning through the wing, the donor's memories, and Elara's final choice. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: "the heart's gift was the courage to track one's own sun trails." Subtext operates effectively through the physical examination standing for self-examination. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in "magnetizing stories."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature ("valley-mist wonder," "whispering chasms"). No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the wing examination sequence. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("god Arcturus's daily path"), but overall the voice coheres with purposeful compression serving the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs—"The structure, a colossal boulder hollowed by ancient winds and tethered by vines" establishes setting while suggesting transformation. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("god Arcturus," "sun maps from forgotten astronomers") and some metaphor density in peak beats reduces clarity ("quietly explosive truth settling in her chest"). No major loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The heart transplant as catalyst for story-magnetism offers a fresh angle on artistic transformation. The specific synthesis of dye mastery with narrative attraction feels non-obvious. However, the core metaphor of "magnetizing stories" remains somewhat abstract and could apply to many artistic awakening narratives. The floating tea house and wing examination method show originality but don't fully transform the underlying template of artistic self-discovery.</comment>
