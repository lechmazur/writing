<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her meticulous preservation work, but her internal experience remains largely abstract without embodied contradiction or cost. The final choice to "recalibrate" and "infuse" lacks visible personal stakes or sacrifice—she succeeds without meaningful struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the stabilization of the vows, qualifying as Earned Stasis. However, the cost remains abstract ("oblivion's edge") rather than felt—Elara pays no visible price for her success, and the resolution arrives through technical adjustment rather than meaningful sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vividly rendered with crystalline spires, iced tomes, and frost-etched details that create strong atmosphere. The environment constrains Elara's work through the "quartz hush" and crystalline tools, though it could more directly pressure her choices beyond providing aesthetic backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the luminous vows) is signaled early but escalation remains flat—Elara measures frequencies, adjusts the lantern, and succeeds without encountering meaningful resistance or forced trade-offs. The vows' decay creates urgency but no actual pressure that narrows her options or extracts cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of preservation against entropy emerges through concrete imagery of fading vows and spectral measurements. However, the resolution offers no complexity—preservation simply succeeds through technical competence, missing the opportunity to explore what might be lost or sacrificed in the act of saving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains an elevated, crystalline register appropriate to the setting ("quartz hush," "luminous splendor") with controlled distance. However, the voice lacks distinct personality beyond ornate description, and Elara's perceptual signature doesn't evolve under pressure—she remains uniformly "gently meticulous" throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with stacked modifiers ("gently meticulous nature a quiet anchor amid the shifting veils") and abstract metaphors that obscure concrete action. Template phrasing appears in "she moved through...with deliberate grace" and "her mind weaving patterns"—stock constructions that dilute specificity. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, particularly in peak moments where "recalibrating to infuse frequencies with stabilizing echoes" abstracts the crucial action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frozen library concept offers visual distinctiveness but executes familiar preservation-of-knowledge themes without transformation. The spectral measurement method adds technical texture but the core arc (dedicated keeper saves fading knowledge through careful work) follows expected patterns without risk or surprising inflection.</comment>
