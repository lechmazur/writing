<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her father's arson history, with embodied details like "fingering the black sand" and the scars as "forgotten rivers." The wanderer provides secondary pressure that forces Elara to articulate her philosophy. However, internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses, and the wanderer's transformation feels somewhat abrupt without sufficient groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the grafting act and the wanderer's acceptance, with visible cost in both characters' scars. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of shared healing. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure lands with "the song had begun," though the wanderer's arc could use stronger causal linkage to Elara's actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic landscape constrain and enable Elara's grafting ritual, with the black sand serving as both talisman and grafting material. Sensory details like "kelp-drift peace" and "shadows grazing the dunes like nomadic whispers" create atmosphere while the scarred tree provides the physical site for transformation. The setting actively participates in the closure through the grafting location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving "scars can sing"—is signaled early and tested through the grafting ritual and the wanderer's arrival. The wanderer's appearance provides meaningful complication that deepens the thematic question. However, escalation remains relatively gentle without sharp pressure increases, and the cost, while present in the scars and histories, could be more viscerally felt in the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and the parallel between Elara's scars and the wanderer's burns, avoiding direct moralizing. The coin as lucky piece turned binding thread offers layered meaning about transformation. The final image of the wanderer's scars "seeming less silent" resonates without stating the moral. Some passages like "believing that even the deepest burns could heal" edge toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a lyrical, contemplative voice appropriate to the reflective tone, with distinctive phrases like "kelp-drift peace" and "migration of clouds." POV remains stable in close third. Dialogue between Elara and the wanderer feels natural with subtext about shared trauma. Some filter constructions ("she knew then") and occasional elevated diction ("resonant," "unyielding compassion") slightly distance the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm in passages like the grafting sequence. However, several abstract phrases lack specificity ("defiant harmony," "unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert poise"), and there's some repetition of concepts (scars/singing appears multiple times). The opening sentence runs long at 35 words. Information density is moderate but could be higher given the word count.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grafting-as-healing metaphor offers a fresh angle on trauma and redemption, particularly with the specific detail of using the father's coin as binding. The parallel between literal firefighting and metaphorical healing of old burns shows originality. However, the redemption-through-compassion arc follows familiar patterns, and some elements like the wanderer's convenient appearance feel somewhat contrived.</comment>
