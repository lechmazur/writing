<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand sacred thresholds drives consistent action, and her "featherly determined" trait manifests through concrete behaviors. The final choice to speak weather codes and cross back home shows earned agency with visible cost (her long separation). However, interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("burned softly," "fractured hush") rather than embodied emotion, and the father remains a distant memory figure without contradictory depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara crosses back home by understanding necessary distances, with the cost of her long separation visible throughout. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns (prisms, thresholds, distances) build toward the final crossing. Causality flows clearly from finding the logbook to intuiting the weather codes to arranging prisms. Orientation anchors solidly (Elara on the drifting terrace after the butterfly effect), though the mechanism of her return feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace creates genuine constraint—Elara is trapped there until she discovers how to leave. Sensory details like "prisms clinking like forgotten chimes" and "the sigh of clouds brushing the terrace's underbelly" establish atmosphere effectively. The wooden table's grain patterns function as micro-setting that enables the key discovery. However, the corn maze world exists only in memory without tactical pressure, and some descriptions lean abstract ("fractured sky into shards of muted color").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—returning home by understanding sacred thresholds—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Finding the logbook creates a meaningful tightening that enables new tactics (using weather codes to summon winds). The cost of separation is felt through "lost child" repetition and the father's absence. However, no opposing force complicates Elara's discovery or arrangement of prisms, making escalation purely internal rather than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of necessary distances as "quiet architects of meaning" emerges organically through the pilot's weather codes, corn maze paths, and the final crossing. The father's wisdom about trusting "the spaces between" resonates without becoming didactic. The ending reweights all prior threshold imagery when Elara crosses "that sacred edge where void met vessel." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract formulation "necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning" that borders on thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "featherly determined" and "fractured hush," creating a dreamlike texture appropriate to the premise. POV remains stable in third-limited without head-hopping. However, register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's plausible lexicon ("sacred buffer against downdrafts," "symmetric solidarity"), and some constructions feel writerly rather than character-driven ("the world mending in whispers").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("golden stalks that twisted like veins under harvest moons") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern or payoff. Template cadence appears in "she recalled...she arranged...she stepped" sequence. Abstract phrasing like "fractured hush" and "featherly determined" repeats without gaining precision. The line "necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning" ventures into explanatory territory that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The butterfly effect creating a liminal space between realities offers a fresh angle on separation stories. Using pilot weather codes as a map for navigating metaphysical distances shows creative synthesis. The corn maze architect father whose child becomes lost in a larger maze creates thematic resonance. However, the resolution mechanism (arranging prisms to mimic wingbeats) feels somewhat arbitrary rather than inevitable, preventing higher scoring.</comment>
