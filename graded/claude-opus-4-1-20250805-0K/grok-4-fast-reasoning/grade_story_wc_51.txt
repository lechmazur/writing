<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect burdens and balance her fractal curse is clear and drives meaningful choices. The internal contradiction between entrapment and purpose works well, though her emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract. The transformation of ethereal burdens into stone weights shows concrete micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara glimpses potential release while remaining trapped, with the cost of eternal vigil made legible. The accumulative lens holds as she methodically transforms burdens, building density toward the crystallized ending. However, the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt rather than intellectually stated ("perhaps the sum of all burdens would counter").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto's fractal geometry directly constrains Elara's existence and shapes her method of collecting burdens. Sensory details like "oxidized copper that gleamed like ancient armor" and the "shingled hush" create vivid atmosphere. The kerosene lamp becomes a tool that enables her core action, making the setting essential to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's quest to escape her fractal curse through burden collection, with each transformation showing incremental progress. The widow's sorrow and merchant's regret provide specific weight to abstract concepts. However, escalation remains steady rather than intensifying—no meaningful tightening occurs that would narrow her options or force harder choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of universal burden emerges organically through Elara's collecting of "human frailty" in stone form. The paradox of finding purpose within entrapment resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of "starlit vigil" with the cooling lamp effectively reweights her trap as both prison and loom, though the insight about burden-as-release edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with controlled diction like "whalebone reverie" and "fractal weaver." The perceptual signature focuses on recursive patterns and weight, fitting Elara's nature. Some phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped" feel forced, but overall the prose texture supports the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of key concepts without becoming loops. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. However, abstract phrases like "universal truths" and "map of human frailty" lack the concrete specificity that would elevate the writing, and some metaphors strain ("loom for universal truths").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a fractal weaver trapped in recursive geometry while collecting crystallized burdens offers fresh synthesis. The specific transformation mechanism using the lamp's oriented light to calcify ethereal weights shows imaginative detail. The piece commits to its mystical premise without retreat, though some elements feel derivative of fantasy archetypes.</comment>
