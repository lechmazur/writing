<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticent nature manifests consistently through minimal dialogue and protective silence, with his warmly observant eyes providing concrete embodiment. His decision to continue the letter chain and rebuild the stone stack shows agency under pressure with visible cost—the "luminescent ache" he carries forward. The character arc from solitary skipper to guardian of tradition feels earned, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("unfamiliar ache in his chest") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery driving the narrative—stone stacks, letter chain, sea glass—building to Elias's decision to preserve the tradition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he relights the lamp while carrying forward the "bottled essence of safety," with felt cost in his acceptance of the lonely burden. The single-scene structure maintains coherent causality from arrival through discovery to commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively—the spiral stairs, lantern room, and isolated location all pressure Elias's investigation. Sensory details like "salt and something spectral" and "rain pattered against the curved glass panes" create atmosphere while the discovered letters and sea glass function as micro-settings that enable the final choice. The "luminescent" quality threads through descriptions, though some passages lean on abstract modifiers rather than concrete sensation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse tradition and safety of sailors—emerges through accumulating discoveries rather than reversals. Pressure builds as Elias uncovers the letter chain's history, with the missing keeper Harlan creating urgency. The cost becomes visible when Elias accepts the burden of maintaining both the physical light and the emotional tradition, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the letter chain's revelation of isolation transcended by anonymous connection. The sea glass transforms from found object to symbol of continuity, while the stone stacks embody silent communication between solitary guardians. The final image of the relit lamp "carrying the bottled essence of safety into the aching night" resonates without stating its meaning, though "bottled essence" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elias's perceptions, with his seafarer's perspective coloring descriptions ("weathered," "sentinel," "lifeline"). Voice modulates effectively from practical observation to lyrical moments like "iridescent green like bottled ocean light." Some passages drift into elevated register ("luminescent ache for those lost at sea") that slightly exceeds the skipper's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery—"smooth pebbles balanced in a deliberate spiral"—but suffers from abstract phrasing like "luminescent ache" appearing multiple times and "bottled essence of safety" that muddles concrete meaning. Long sentences occasionally lose momentum, particularly the 89-word sentence describing the stone stack discovery. The final image lands effectively despite these periodic density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain concept freshly reimagines lighthouse keeper isolation, transforming a haunted location trope into a story about inherited responsibility. The stone-stacking communication method and sea glass as continuity token show specific invention. While lighthouse stories are familiar territory, the focus on anonymous connection between generations of keepers offers a non-obvious angle on the material.</comment>
