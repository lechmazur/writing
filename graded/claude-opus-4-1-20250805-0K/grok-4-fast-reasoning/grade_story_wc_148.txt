I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias transforms his inherited narrative burden.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to rewrite his father's legacy is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like pressing his palm to the scuffs and kneeling at the confessional. The internal conflict between being his father's echo and finding his own voice drives meaningful choices. However, some interiority relies on abstraction ("sustaining impossibilities") rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias threads his narrative into the lighthouse, transforming from carrying his father's burden to letting it "repose in truth." The accumulative structure builds through concrete images (copperlight, lattice, scuffs) toward this earned transformation. Minor orientation wobble with "hovering" memories and the slightly abstract handling of how stories physically alter the space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting brilliantly constrains and enables the narrative - the confessional booth, spiral stairs as labyrinth, and scarred door all function as active story elements. The "copperlight" atmosphere and salt-etched walls create vivid sensory grounding. The reef functions both literally and metaphorically as the site of the father's death and Elias's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - Elias's need to transform his inherited narrative - intensifies through his physical journey into the lighthouse and confession to the lattice. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as his story merges with the physical space. Cost is visible in the weight of inheritance lifted and the past allowed to "repose in truth," though the opposition could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of the "boy who cried wolf" fable into a meditation on truth, inheritance, and narrative power. The lattice as both divider and sustainer of confessions creates resonant subtext. The ending achieves thematic closure without moralizing, as Elias rows away with "his father's wolf long tamed into repose."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("copperlight," "phantom dangers," "thread the labyrinth"). POV remains stable with Elias throughout, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("men claiming innocence against irrefutable tides"). The voice distinctively combines maritime imagery with confession/narrative metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures create momentum. However, abstract phrases like "sustaining impossibilities" and "hovering slightly askew" occasionally muddle clarity. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("sustaining the impossibility that stories could bridge chasms") edges toward overwriting without full pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story freshly reimagines the "boy who cried wolf" through the son's perspective, transforming a cautionary tale into an exploration of narrative inheritance. The lighthouse-as-prison-as-confessional creates an original synthesis. The specific detail of stories physically altering space through the lattice offers genuine ingenuity.</comment>
