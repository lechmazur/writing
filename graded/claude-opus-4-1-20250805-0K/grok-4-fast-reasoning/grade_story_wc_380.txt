<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to recover deleted memories is clear and embodied through concrete actions like digging through salt with fluctuating gravity. The internal conflict between grief and recovery plays out in scene, though some passages lean toward explanatory interiority ("he was adrift, a lantern lighter with no flame of his own"). The final choice to pocket the wildflowers and return to his work shows earned acceptance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's beaching triggering memory loss, leading to Elias's descent into the salt chamber where he recovers his wife's pressed flowers. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when finding the flowers restores his memories and reweights the whale's death as purposeful rather than random. Some causality strains appear (why would whale songs dislodge memories stored in salt crystals), but the emotional cost of grief recovered is palpable in "his lost pieces reclaimed from the earth's quiet hoard."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as more than setting—its fluctuating gravity pockets actively constrain Elias's digging ("sometimes lifting clumps effortlessly, other times pinning them down like lead"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, from "fractured rainbows across the crystals" to the coffee's aroma "cutting through the brine." The chamber's properties (storing deleted memories in crystal lattices) directly enable the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost memories of his dead wife—is signaled early and tested through Elias's dangerous descent and excavation in unstable gravity. The escalation from memory loss to active recovery through divination and digging provides one meaningful deepening. However, the revelation that the whale purposefully dislodged memories feels somewhat convenient rather than earned through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete relationship between forgetting and preservation, with deleted memories finding physical form in salt crystals. The wildflowers bridge past joy and present grief without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias carrying "a deeper treasure" while the whale will be "harvested by dawn" creates resonant contrast between surface and depth, physical and emotional recovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elias's interiority with evocative perceptual signatures like "gleaming silence" recurring as both description and emotional state. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("the earth's veins pulsed with crystalline growth") that slightly exceeds the lantern lighter's expected lexicon. The voice modulates effectively between memory, present action, and discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("its massive form crashing against the docks in a final, shuddering sigh") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Phrases like "earth's quiet hoard" and "echoes in amber" feel performatively literary. Some template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "he/his" constructions, though the closure sequence maintains cleaner propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of whale beaching, memory loss, and salt crystal storage creates an original magical realist framework. The coffee ground divination adds unexpected texture to what could have been straightforward fantasy. While the core grief/memory plot is familiar, the specific combination of dock-side life, geological mysticism, and the whale as catalyst feels fresh and inevitable by the ending.</comment>
