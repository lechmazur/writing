<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover the mathematics of mercy" drives meaningful choices, particularly his deliberate self-triggering of trauma responses through the pewter strap. The internal contradiction between seeking forgiveness and forcing himself to relive betrayals creates authentic tension. However, the mathematical framing of mercy feels conceptual rather than embodied, and his emotional progression relies on abstract formulations ("mercy growing only after thresholds of suffering were crossed") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elias crystallizes his path forward with the equation metaphor while the UV forest promises continued suffering. The causal chain from escape to forest to deliberate trauma-triggering to insight works, with visible cost in his physical and emotional pain. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3, and the lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The UV forest functions as more than backdrop—its punishing light creates physical pressure that compounds Elias's suffering and frames his penance. The pewter strap serves as micro-setting, constraining choice when he uses it to trigger memories. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the bark becomes "Braille of past errors"), though the forest's specific properties beyond UV glow could be more developed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering mercy's mathematics through suffering—signals early and tightens when Elias deliberately triggers trauma responses, narrowing his options to either endure memories or abandon his quest. The cost is visible in his physical reactions (sweating, gasping, bracing). However, the escalation plateaus after the trauma sequence, and the final walk toward insight lacks the pressure intensification needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mathematical equation metaphor for mercy emerges organically from Elias's cartographer background and interrogation experience, avoiding direct statement. The theme develops through concrete suffering—the strap's pressure, phantom skull constriction, enhanced proprioception—rather than abstraction. The final image of Elias as "compass pointing toward mercy's hidden formula" resonates without moralizing, though the mathematical framing occasionally drifts toward conceptual abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction matching Elias's apparent education and the story's literary register. The perceptual signature shows in how he processes the world through mathematical/cartographic metaphors ("mapping hidden routes," "variables of pain"). Some passages drift into overly conceptual register ("exponential mercy"), but rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, shortening during trauma responses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments ("the air humming with invisible radiation that promised purification through pain") but suffers from conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing. The "mathematics of mercy" concept repeats without evolution, and phrases like "displaced rootedness" and "rooted pull" create mixed metaphors. Filter verbs accumulate in the trauma sequence ("He felt," "memories surged"), dulling immediacy during a peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The interrogation-survivor-seeks-mathematical-mercy premise offers an unusual angle, and the UV penance forest creates a distinctive setting. However, the mathematical equation metaphor for mercy, while specific to this character, doesn't fully transform through the story—it arrives early and remains conceptually static. The enhanced proprioception detail adds originality but could be more deeply integrated into how Elias uniquely experiences his world.</comment>
