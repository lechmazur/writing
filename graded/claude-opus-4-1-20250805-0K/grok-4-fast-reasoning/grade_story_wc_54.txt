I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where redirected flows resurrect the terminal's possibilities.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "stoic wonder" characterization holds consistently, but internal conflict remains largely cerebral without embodied contradiction. The transformation from observation to action feels earned through accumulated detail, though peak moments lack visceral emotional embodiment beyond "spark of intrigue" and "quiet satisfaction."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the terminal transforms from "graveyard of dreams" to "whispered of voyages yet to come" with visible cost (her solitary effort). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through technical details and the sextant's reweighting, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric grounding with the abandoned terminal constraining choices (using sextant fragment as gauge, navigating collapsed sections). Sensory detail effectively filtered through engineer's perspective noting "alignment marks" and "pressure differentials." The setting actively shapes her solution through its architectural remnants.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulation as Elara progresses from discovery to implementation, with one meaningful deepening when she realizes the sextant can guide restoration. The maze provides minor complications but lacks genuine opposition or risk - success feels assured rather than earned against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the resurrection metaphor and "equations for hope" without explicit moralizing. The final image of the terminal "whispering of voyages yet to come" resonantly reweights the opening's "forgotten era," though the transformation lacks deeper complexity or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinctive engineering-focused perceptual signature ("skeletal remnants," "pressure differentials," "fluid dynamics") maintains consistency. Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with controlled psychic distance, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("time's indifferent tide").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and good momentum. However, several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("equations for hope," "cosmos of what could be") and some template constructions appear ("Elara knelt...Elara adjusted...Elara had not just"). Information density could be higher in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of celestial navigation with engineering restoration offers fresh specificity, particularly using the sextant fragment as an improvised gauge. The abandoned spaceport setting with carnival aftermath creates an original atmosphere, though the lone-genius-fixes-everything arc follows familiar patterns.</comment>
