I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain: Elena seeks truth from her father's legacy → discovers the ink pot → uses it to breach the sealed letter → obtains the formula that transforms her understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is concrete and rooted in her relationship with Marco, driving her to breach the drawer and decode his final message. The internal conflict between honoring/questioning her father manifests through specific actions. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("the honest one") and occasional emotional summary rather than full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena inherits both formula and transformed understanding of her father, with visible cost (accepting his criminal legacy to find meaning). The closure lands with "carrying the weight of fair trade" - a clear before/after with emotional price. Slight deduction for the formula's abstract presentation without more concrete dramatization of its impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prep room setting effectively constrains choices through the mortician's presence and the locked drawer, with sensory details ("sharp tang of formaldehyde," "cold steel table") that create atmosphere. The ink pot functions as micro-setting that enables the key action. Deduction for some generic death imagery and missed opportunities to have the chemical environment more actively pressure Elena's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake (finding proof of fairness in Marco's life) escalates through active waiting, the breach, and revelation. The tightening occurs when Elena must risk discovery to access the locked drawer. Cost is visible but could be more visceral - the "weight" she carries is somewhat abstract rather than dramatically tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematics metaphor and the transformation of con artistry into "calculated honesty." The final formula offers a non-literal answer that reweights Marco from pure deceiver to survival strategist. Minor deduction for the formula being stated rather than fully dramatized through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization throughout. Strong perceptual signature in how Elena notices con artist details and mathematical patterns. Prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the discovery sequence. Slight deduction for occasional filter phrases that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("deathly vitality" used repetitively), some template phrasing ("Heart pounding with deathly vitality"), and minor scaffold in the mathematical formula presentation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of con artistry with mathematical fairness offers a fresh angle, and the prep room setting for this revelation is non-obvious. The story commits to its premise of finding honor in dishonor. However, the "child of con artist seeks meaning" frame is somewhat familiar, and the mathematical formula resolution, while thematically apt, lacks full transformation through lived detail.</comment>
