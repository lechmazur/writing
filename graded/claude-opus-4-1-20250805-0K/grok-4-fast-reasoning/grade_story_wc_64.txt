<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's blithe spirit and methodical puzzle-solving create a consistent character, with his belief that "the dead left puzzles for the living to solve" driving investigation. The final realization about fluid intentions is earned through his discovery process. However, interiority lacks embodied contradiction during key moments, relying on gentle curiosity rather than conflicted impulses, and the chess metaphor feels imposed rather than emerging from character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear discovery beats: finding the case → examining tapestry → decoding threads → understanding the past duel. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elias realizes "the shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid," though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The meta-commentary about word count and the orientation delay (cemetery context emerges gradually) weaken structural clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and velveteen cemetery atmosphere create strong sensory grounding, with moonlight filtering through cracked panels effectively staging the discovery scene. The silo's transformation from farm relic to puzzle-solving sanctuary constrains Elias's investigation space. Minor deduction for some purple prose ("velveteen gloom" repetition) that doesn't quite earn its elevated register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of uncovering the tapestry's secret escalates through methodical discovery, with each decoded thread revealing chess symbols that build toward understanding the past duel. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance or cost—Elias faces no obstacles, time pressure, or difficult choices. The resolution about fluid intentions arrives without forcing any trade-off or foreclosing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The chess-as-life metaphor develops through concrete details (knight's move, queen's gambit in tapestry threads) connecting to the historical duel of minds. The theme of intentions as "fluid, tenderly organized by time's hand" emerges from the discovery process. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("the shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid") reduces subtlety, though it avoids full moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a lyrical, contemplative voice appropriate to nocturnal cemetery wandering, with controlled diction like "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes." The perceptual signature shows Elias seeing death as puzzles and graves as friends. Significant deduction for the meta-commentary breaking voice ("But wait, that exceeded; trim back in mind") and some register drift into overly precious phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears throughout without always serving pressure ("velveteen gloom" used three times, "tender organization" twice). The meta-commentary about word count creates a major artifact. Template cadence emerges in discovery sequence ("Each thread...revealed," "As he pieced...grew clearer"). Some effective moments exist (the silo description, moonlight staging) but overwriting and repetition accumulate throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of a cemetery gardener solving historical puzzles through found tapestry offers moderate freshness, combining gothic atmosphere with detective elements. The chess duel backstory and rival motivations feel somewhat generic. The specific detail of decoding tapestry threads for chess notation shows invention, but the resolution about fluid intentions arrives as expected wisdom rather than surprising insight.</comment>
