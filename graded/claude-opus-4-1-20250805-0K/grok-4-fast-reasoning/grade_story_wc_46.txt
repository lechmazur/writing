<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to share light without fire is grounded in trauma (the cliff fire) and drives concrete action through sea glass polishing. Internal progression from isolation to connection is earned, though some introspective passages lean toward diagnostic clarity ("to bridge her earthbound gaze to the heavens"). The final choice to share the glass with villagers shows clear agency with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and sensory details build toward Elara's transformation from isolation to connection. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she shares the sea glass with villagers, creating community through reflected light. Cost is visible in her emergence from protective isolation. Some causality wobbles in the middle third with excessive reflection, but the ending reweights her earthbound watching as a bridge for others.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as both physical constraint and emotional crucible, its mist and bioluminescent fungi creating atmospheric pressure. Sea glass discovery in the grotto's depths drives the pivotal turn. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("walls slick and curving like the spine of some ancient serpent"). The grotto's shadow in the final scene charges the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Central stake of isolation versus connection intensifies through sea glass discovery and polishing, culminating in the choice to leave the grotto. Agency manifests through deliberate action (polishing method, emergence, gathering villagers). The tightening from private treasure to shared beacon works, though middle sections with heavy reflection dilute immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of light without fire emerges organically through concrete action and mother's teachings, avoiding direct moralizing. The sea glass as non-consumptive illumination resonates against the destructive fire backstory. Final image of villagers drawn to reflected light offers non-literal answer to the central question. Some thematic repetition ("pearl of stillness") approaches redundancy without quite crossing into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled metaphorical density, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("serpentine grotto shrouded in perpetual mist"). POV remains stable with Elara throughout. Perceptual signature emerges in how she notices light and reflection. Elevated diction occasionally strains against the intimate scale ("vaulted sky," "labyrinthine haven").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("zephyr bloom" appears 5 times, "resurface" 6 times, "pearl of stillness" 3 times). Information density varies; some passages do multiple jobs while others loop concepts. Figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("mist swirled like blooming petals"). No major grammar issues but sentence variety could improve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of sharing light through reflection rather than combustion offers a fresh angle on healing and connection. Sea glass as beacon transforms a common beach object through specific emotional weight. The grotto setting and bioluminescent details create memorable atmosphere. However, the mother's-wisdom-guides-healing arc follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
