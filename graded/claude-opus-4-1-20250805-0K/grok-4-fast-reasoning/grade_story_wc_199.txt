<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode the leaves drives concrete actions throughout, with her transformation from orderly sorter to intuitive reader earned through the moonstone's touch. The internal shift from methodical to poetic feels credible, though some emotional transitions could be more embodied—particularly the "mossy delight" which reads more as labeled than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increasing through monument-building and leaf-decoding that culminates in Elara's transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (her orderly nature "laced with poetic intuition"), though the transformation's speed slightly strains credibility. The piece teaches its pattern early with the falling leaves as messages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor setting actively constrains and enables choices—the suspended walkways, ancient bark compartments, and moss-draped surfaces all participate in Elara's work. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting that charges the transformation. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("ashen skyborne") that could be more specific to this world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about leaf messages to discovering world-healing prophecy, with the moonstone touch as the decisive tightening moment. The cost is visible in Elara's transformation from pure order to wild-laced intuition. Pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens, though the final cascade of moonstone dust feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the balance of order versus wild intuition, with the monuments serving as physical manifestations of this tension. The ending reweights prior sorting work as "sacred rite" without explicit moralizing. The recurring moonstone and leaf motifs accumulate meaning, though "mossy delight" feels forced as a thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Some elevated diction ("liminal stillness," "cryptic symbols") fits the mythic tone but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The perceptual signature of noticing patterns and categories is character-specific, though internal voice could be more distinctive during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though several instances of elevated diction blur clarity ("ashen skyborne arbor," "liminal stillness when whispers of ancestors mingled"). Some repetitive phrasing around "mossy delight" (appears 3 times) and "prodded" (4 times) creates minor loops. The accumulation of "tiny monuments" and transformation language in the final third maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of monuments to forgotten things as keys to prophecy offers a fresh angle on the decoder-protagonist trope. The synthesis of order and wildness through seed-sorting feels specific and earned. Transformation from systematic categorizer to intuitive reader avoids simple binaries, though some elements (moonstone magic) lean on familiar fantasy conventions.</comment>
