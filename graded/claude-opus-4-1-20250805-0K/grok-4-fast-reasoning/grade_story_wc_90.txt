<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's pacifist code drives genuine internal tension through shadow work confronting violent memories, with embodied responses like "recoiled from" and "gravitationally lighter when happy." However, his transformation lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—the shadow integration proceeds too smoothly without genuine struggle or cost to his core identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with shadow work ritual building through photographs→tapestry→tear→dimension opening, creating Resonant Reconfiguration where "ghosts of the past found their way home." Cost is conceptual but legible through "shadows lingered—unresolved fragments" requiring confrontation. Minor deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the post-human timeline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship's "cracked viewports" and "low gravity" actively shape Elias's floating movement and ritual staging, while Kwan Yin's tear serves as micro-setting that "amplified the method." The faded photographs' "brittle and yellowed" physicality with "long-dried tears" creates tactile specificity that constrains the ritual's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: scanning photographs reveals "families torn by old wars"→stitching binds "shadow to light"→tear amplifies method→dimension yields. The ritual's internal logic drives pressure as "shadows recede like mist before dawn," though agency feels somewhat passive—Elias performs prescribed steps rather than making difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the integration of shadow work—"stitching the dark threads of denial into the fabric of acceptance"—with the final image of ghosts finding peace offering resonant answer to humanity's unresolved trauma. The tear's compassion opposing violence creates genuine thematic tension without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distinctive ethereal voice with "specter through dim corridors" and "resolve as ghostly as the nebulae," though register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("pure compassion," "boundless compassion"). POV control is stable but lacks the perceptual signature that would elevate—Elias notices everything with equal weight rather than through his specific pacifist lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Several runs of template cadence ("Elias activated...Elias initiated...Elias began") and abstract phrasing ("pure intent," "serene expanse") that dulls specificity. Strong moments like "shimmers danced under his light" and "gravitationally lighter when happy" show capability, but overwriting in phrases like "resolve ghostly yet unyielding" creates distance. Filter-verb stack in ritual sequence reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shadow work ritual using photographs' dried tears as method shows genuine originality, and "gravitationally lighter when happy" provides fresh specificity. However, the pacifist-AI-after-humanity premise feels familiar, and the resolution through dimensional portal tends toward the abstract rather than surprising with concrete particulars.</comment>
