<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to integrate drives consistent choices through her bold sympathy, though her interiority relies on abstract labels ("luminescent ache," "bold sympathy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final integration feels earned through accumulated gestures, but peak emotional moments lack the visceral specificity that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's integration into the community, with visible cost in her vulnerability and effort. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details of search and sculpture-making layer toward belonging, though the resolution's emotional weight feels somewhat predetermined rather than dramatically discovered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard setting actively shapes choices—the crater's depths force Lir to confront past losses, while the obsidian arbor serves as both destination and communal anchor. Sensory details like "bioluminescent fungi" and "iridescent mists" create atmosphere, though some descriptions ("facets of quartz and amethyst caught the perpetual twilight") prioritize beauty over constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of belonging escalates through the shared search, with Elara's reed sculptures becoming the bridge to integration. The descent into the crater provides meaningful tightening as Lir must overcome hesitation, though the discovery of the tag feels convenient rather than hard-won through accumulated pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The webs of kinship theme emerges organically through action—the search, the tag's discovery, Elara's reed-weaving—culminating in her literal grafting onto community. The final dedication ceremony resonates without explicit moralizing, though the theme occasionally surfaces too directly in dialogue ("It spoke of our webs").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the crystalline setting, with controlled rhythm through longer periodic sentences. However, abstract descriptors ("luminescent ache," "bold sympathy") recur without variation, and filter constructions occasionally distance us from immediacy ("Elara felt the glow of belonging pierce her isolation").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Template phrases repeat throughout ("luminescent ache" appears 3 times, "bold sympathy" 4 times), creating synonym loops that dull impact. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("crystals refracted light into rainbows that danced across the crater's rim") but suffers from overwriting in emotional peaks and repetitive sentence openings ("Elara..." begins multiple sequential sentences).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard setting offers fresh visual specificity, and the concept of a marsh-reed sculptor seeking community through recovered graffiti shows imagination. However, the emotional arc follows familiar stranger-to-belonging patterns without surprising transformation, and the mystical setting elements feel ornamental rather than essential to the core conflict.</comment>
