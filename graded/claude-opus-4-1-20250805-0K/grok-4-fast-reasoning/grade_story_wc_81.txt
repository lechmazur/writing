<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara shows consistent traits (logical indexer, tranquilly perceptive) that drive her methodical approach. Her internal contradiction between doubt and resolve ("dappled resolve") feels authentic. The final commitment to "readjust the world's understanding" is earned through her discovery process, showing meaningful character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens building toward conceptual repricing - Elara reweights Thalassara's fall from disaster to deliberate preservation. Good orientation and single-scene focus. The closure lands with cost (her commitment to surface the truth) and the discovery sequence follows logical causality through her indexing method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is richly detailed and constrains action throughout. Environmental details like the blackout, submerged maps, and spiral architecture directly enable the discovery. Good sensory work with "dust motes," "barnacle-crusted box," and spatial choreography. Setting participates meaningfully in the closure revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tracing honest origins) is clear and drives action. Meaningful deepening occurs when she posits the alternative hypothesis, reframing the city's fall. However, the pressure feels moderate - more intellectual discovery than high-stakes conflict. The cost is commitment to new understanding rather than visceral sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truth versus surface narrative emerges organically through the discovery sequence. Good use of depth imagery and the contrast between disaster/preservation. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration without heavy moralizing, reweighting the premise through specific discovery rather than abstract statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with clean focalization. Voice has distinctive archival/scholarly texture matching Elara's profession. Perceptual signature shows her methodical, cataloging approach to observation. Some slightly elevated diction but stays within character bounds. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Generally clear prose with good information density, but several repetitive elements reduce momentum. "Tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" appear multiple times, creating template-like echoes. Some parallel sentence structures create rhythmic monotony. Clarity remains intact but efficiency could improve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twist that Thalassara's submersion was voluntary preservation rather than disaster provides a fresh angle. The archivist protagonist and underwater library setting feel specific rather than generic. The discovery method through cross-referencing stamps and maps shows good synthesis of familiar elements into something more original.</comment>
