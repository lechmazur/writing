<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's calm inventiveness manifests through concrete actions (tracing wards, decoding the sundial) with clear motivation to spark revolution, though her internal contradictions remain understated. The supporting cast functions collectively rather than as distinct individuals, but their gathering creates sufficient pressure for the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from blackout opportunity through sundial decoding to accessing the cradle of sparks, with Elara's knowledge and the quill holder's properties driving each turn. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the group's collective "wink" and shared vision crystallize their revolutionary commitment, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort's architecture and the cradle chamber's "floating embers of pure potential" create a distinctive fantastical atmosphere that shapes choices. The sundial mechanism and spiral stair constrain Elara's method of access, making the setting functional rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal opportunity during the blackout to collective revolutionary action in the cradle, with the Dominion's tyranny as persistent external pressure. The cost appears as risk ("dissenters") and the irreversible step of igniting revolution, though the immediate price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "winking hush" motif effectively bridges silence as both tactical necessity and revolutionary method, culminating in the group's shared wink that transforms conspiracy into action. The cradle's literal sparks becoming metaphorical revolutionary sparks creates resonant layering without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent fantasy-register with phrases like "velvet darkness" and "captured starlight," though occasional overwriting ("the calmly inventive grace") dulls precision. POV control remains stable throughout with no head-hopping, and the piece teaches its slightly elevated register early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elara's vigilance... Elara's inventive mind... Elara sealed") and some overwritten passages ("luminous fort at twilight, where walls shimmered like captured starlight"). Information density is adequate but several sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle sections describing the sundial mechanism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of revolutionary "sparks" as both literal magical embers and metaphorical ideas offers a fresh fantasy angle on rebellion narrative. The silent revolution through coded communication rather than violence provides specificity, though some fantasy elements (runes, enchanted lanterns) feel stock.</comment>
