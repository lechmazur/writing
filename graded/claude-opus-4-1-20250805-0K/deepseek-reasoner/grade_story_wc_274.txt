<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between duty and truth-seeking drives a credible arc with embodied tension ("heart... began to hammer against her ribs"). The moment of decision compresses convincingly into "the space within the blink," though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("bravely conflicted" as self-label). Her final transformation from archivist to "first word in a new sentence" lands with earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara seeds doubt rather than starts war. The closure lands with visible cost ("her own truth now another piece of contraband") and the final image of imperceptible thawing reweights the opening's "perpetual frost." Causality holds as discovery leads to internal conflict then decisive action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library setting directly constrains choice through its surveillance architecture and "walls... threaded with ancient, slumbering data conduits." Sensory detail ("breath pluming," "crystalline case that felt different, warmer") filters through Elara's professional lens. The snow metaphor charges the final image where "something long frozen had begun, imperceptibly, to thaw."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovery through internal war to irreversible action, with pressure cohering around the truth/silence dichotomy. The cost is legible ("her own truth now another piece of contraband waiting to be found"), though the immediate consequences remain abstract—chimes sounding rather than concrete opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the silence/truth opposition without explicit moralizing, culminating in "doubt was the most dangerous thing of all." The final image of snow burying while something thaws beneath offers resonant ambiguity. Some thematic language edges toward abstraction ("contraband truths were the most volatile substance") but remains grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal register appropriate to Elara's archivist role with selective perception ("towering aisles of frozen data-slates"). Some prose tends toward elevated abstraction ("sanctuary where history slept") that occasionally distances from immediacy. The perceptual signature holds but lacks distinctive rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong compression ("The truth was a live wire in her hand") but suffers from abstract density in places ("capable of thawing the frozen past into a chaotic present"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("quiet, devastating earthquake" followed by extended explanation). Information density is uneven, with some passages doing single rather than multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frozen archive as tomb for dangerous knowledge offers fresh specificity, and the twist that power knows but depends on maintained silence adds originality. The synthesis of cryogenic preservation with information control feels earned. Some elements trend toward familiar dystopian templates but the execution through "quiet earthquake" rather than revolution distinguishes it.</comment>
