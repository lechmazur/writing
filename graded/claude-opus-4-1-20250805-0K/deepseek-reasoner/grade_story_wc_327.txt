<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in cultural preservation, with embodied tension between her purpose and the cursed diamond's resistance. The internal conflict between accepting dissonance versus fighting for purity creates genuine struggle, though the resolution feels slightly too neat when she "accepts" the curse's nature without more visible cost to her copper veins or body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the canyon becomes "a perfect, silent song" with clear conceptual cost (the death of spoken language transformed into pure experience). The bird patterns provide causal linkage to her method, and the diamond's transformation from cold antagonist to warm vessel marks decisive change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone canyon setting actively constrains and enables Elara's work through its echo properties, with vivid sensory detail ("bleached white," "copper veins glowed warmly"). The environment functions as both antagonist and recording device, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("frozen lightning bolt").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the diamond's resistance threatening to "shatter the bone towers and her own mind," with clear tightening when dissonance must be woven into the symphony rather than eliminated. The cost is legible in accepting painful memories as part of cultural truth, though the second bird flock feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the texture-to-sound translation metaphor, with the final realization that "a culture's story is not only joy but also sorrow" earning its resonance through struggle. The transformation of curse into vessel and silence into "perfect, silent song" offers a non-literal answer to preservation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("maw of bleached white," "malice of its own"). The prose modulates effectively during peak stress, but occasional purple patches don't fully align with Elara's practical storyteller voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of overwriting ("frozen lightning bolt that seemed to pulse with a malice of its own") and some redundancy ("final, perfect translation" followed by "perfect, silent song"). Information density is moderate; most sentences advance the story but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller translating texture to sound through a cursed diamond offers fresh synthesis, and the bone canyon as recording device shows originality. However, the "last of her people preserving culture" frame is familiar, elevated primarily through specific execution rather than conceptual innovation.</comment>
