<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's wistful pragmatism creates genuine internal contradiction between loss and practical purpose, embodied through soil-streaked hands and methodical movements. The final choice to plant light instead of seeds emerges from established character logic with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through rhythmic gardening actions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gauge tooth becomes a light-planter. The rose petal's fall triggers purposeful action that reweights loss into creation, with cost visible in "her sadness for the beautiful, fleeting thing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fire escape setting constrains choices through limited space and vertical orientation, while the gauge tooth's precise bittings enable the light-fracturing effect. Sensory hierarchy reflects gardener's priorities—soil texture, moon angles, tool edges—though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming emptiness after loss, with pressure building through the "quivering hush" and "quiet emptiness." The decisive act of angling the gauge tooth to fracture moonlight represents agency through creative repurposing, though escalation remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of a lockpicking tool into a light-planting device, avoiding abstraction. The final constellation of reflected starlight offers a non-literal answer about converting loss into illumination without stating any moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through gardener's selective attention to tools, soil, and light angles. Rhythm modulates from meditative "oars in water" movements to the sudden clarity of "An idea, sudden and clear, bloomed within her," though some passages lean toward writerly polish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, but several overwrought phrases ("luminous harbor by moonlight," "celestial lock being picked") and repetitive constructions weaken momentum. The paraphrase loop "protected vulnerability" appears twice verbatim, and some metaphors strain credibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban gardening with locksmithing tools creates an unexpected angle on grief and renewal. The specific repurposing of the gauge tooth's bittings to fracture light feels earned and non-obvious, though some elements trend toward predictable beauty.</comment>
