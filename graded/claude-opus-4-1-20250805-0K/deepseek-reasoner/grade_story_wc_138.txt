<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eliana's millennia of ennui and her desire to "discover what happens after goodbye" create a clear, consistent motivation that drives the spatial journey. The internal shift from boredom through intrigue to solemn understanding tracks cleanly, though the epiphany about transformation lacks sufficient embodied struggle to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing where Eliana discovers goodbye is "not an end, but a transformation, a returning," with clear cost in her role as eternal witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and cosmic imagery build toward this reweighting of her existence, though the revelation could land with more visceral weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite with its "shimmering walls" and the vortex of "cobalt and magenta energy" create vivid spatial anchors that enable the dimensional journey. The setting actively participates through the spatial mutiny and magnetic storm, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic storm triggers spatial distortion that forces Eliana's journey, creating genuine pressure through environmental chaos. However, she "did not fight it," reducing agency at the crucial moment, and the resolution comes through passive observation rather than active choice with clear trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of connection versus separation emerges organically through Eliana's discovery that her goodbyes persist as "translation" into cosmic fabric. The final understanding that she is "the constant around which the river of existence flowed" offers resonant complexity without moralizing, though it risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose maintains an elevated register appropriate to an immortal's perspective with phrases like "prismatic escondite" and "spatial mutiny." Some passages drift into purple prose ("cacophony of realities where time was a physical dimension"), but the voice remains consistent through the dimensional journey.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>While individual sentences achieve poetic effect ("hushed thunder, a promise of violence held in abeyance"), the prose suffers from density issues with abstract concepts stacked without breathing room. The philosophical weight occasionally obscures momentum, particularly in the vortex sequence where metaphysical description dominates over concrete experience.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of an immortal seeking what comes "after goodbye" through dimensional perception offers a fresh angle on eternal life. The spatial mutiny triggered by magnetic resonance through a cursed fragment creates an original mechanism for exploring existential questions, though the resolution trends toward familiar "everything is connected" territory.</comment>
