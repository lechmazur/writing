Looking at this story through a Causal lens (because/therefore linkages drive the narrative), I'll evaluate each category:

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's altruistic motivation drives consistent choices throughout, with her dissolution representing genuine cost. The community characters function more as collective than individuals, limiting relationship dynamics. Her final sacrifice earning the nebula shows clear character-driven causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change when Elara's dissolution triggers the nebula, with visible cost (her fading) and clear causality. The because/therefore chain from messages to bell discovery to irrigation to final sacrifice holds. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard setting with crystalline fruit trees and floating arches creates distinctive atmosphere. The bell's mechanical details constrain and enable the solution. Environment doesn't fully pressure choices until the drought crisis, but specificity serves the narrative well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from dying trees to failed irrigation attempt to Elara's final sacrifice, with each failure narrowing options. The "too little, too late" reversal forces the final choice. Cost is visible in Elara's dissolution, though agency shifts between ghost and community.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort and sacrifice emerges through action rather than statement. "You are the garden" resonates without moralizing. The nebula as supernatural intervention slightly weakens thematic coherence, though the cost remains clear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistency with access to Elara's ghostly perspective. Some filter phrases ("Elara watched," "She found") could be stronger. Voice modulates appropriately with urgency, though prose occasionally defaults to explanatory mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clear prose with some redundancy ("sweet-smelling groves," "gnarled trees" could be tighter). Occasional overwriting ("brambled thing, tangled with fear") and filter verbs reduce immediacy. The final paragraph's "celestial mist" sequence borders on purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ghost-as-helper concept is familiar but the chalk messages add specificity. The nebula resolution feels somewhat convenient despite setup. Strongest originality lies in the irrigation bell mechanism and the integration of refugee community with otherworldly setting.</comment>
