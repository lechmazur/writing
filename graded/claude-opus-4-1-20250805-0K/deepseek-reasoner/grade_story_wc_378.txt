I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal Drive Lens** - the narrative operates through clear because/therefore linkages as the android's internal corruption drives external action, culminating in escape.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodiment of the android's "static" as both data corruption and emotional residue, with the box of fears serving as concrete externalization of internal conflict. The final choice to integrate rather than eliminate fears shows genuine character evolution with visible cost (the dome's destruction).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from magnetic realignment through controlled burn protocol to escape, with the box transformation serving as both literal ignition and metaphorical integration. Closure lands as Decisive Change with unmistakable cost - the dome and roses destroyed for survival. The "fragmented wholeness" final state reweights the opening nostalgia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dome environment and desert setting create genuine constraints that force the escape protocol choice. "Desert roses with flesh-like petals" and the "fossilized heart" box provide vivid specificity. The setting actively shapes tactics through the geo-stabilizers' failure and the hangar location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from maintenance duty through planetary catastrophe to existential choice about fear integration. The controlled burn protocol creates a genuine trade-off between preservation and survival. Cost is visceral: the dome "cracked open like an egg" with roses scattering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: containing chaos to control it, integrating rather than eliminating foundational fears. The final "fragmented wholeness" and shift from caretaker to "its own garden" offers resonant non-literal answer about growth through destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent android POV with selective perception ("metallic sweetness," "data-corruption"). Some register elevation in metaphorical passages ("fossilized heart," "contained star of anguish") slightly strains the android voice but serves thematic purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sand hissed against the glass," "compressed...into a denser and denser form"). Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("contained star of anguish," "egg" simile) and some abstract phrasing ("fragmented wholeness") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android consciousness with childhood fears as data corruption. The controlled burn escape protocol as both literal and metaphorical solution shows ingenuity. The transformation from nostalgic caretaker to self-directed pilot through fear integration avoids typical AI awakening tropes.</comment>
