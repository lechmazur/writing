<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear and her methodical nature drives every choice, particularly strong in how her "brazen calm" manifests through precise actions with copper wire. The internal shift from caretaker to bridge-builder feels earned through specific gestures. Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about interspecies respect that could have been more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design where copper wire network creates a literal and metaphorical bridge, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (Elara's life). The oaks growing around the copper wires posthumously validates the connection with visible, permanent change. Orientation is immediate and the lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Living stone pillars function as amplifiers constraining how the connection works, and the copper wire becomes essential infrastructure. The orchard setting pressures choices through its ancient sentient oaks. Loses points for not fully exploiting the sensory potential of the consciousness exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The six-month diagnosis creates urgent pressure that drives Elara's "final, wild plan," with escalation through the methodical wire-wrapping building to the consciousness exchange. Cost is unmistakable—her life force depleted by the effort. Could be stronger if the connection attempt had more active resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies understanding emerges through concrete action rather than declaration, with the copper network becoming a permanent monument to connection. The final image of oaks embracing human-made additions resonantly answers the central question. Slight deduction for one instance of explicit theme statement about "misunderstanding."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature in botanical observations. Voice modulates appropriately during the consciousness exchange. However, some register drift into overly clinical language ("clinical thunderclap," "gentle systematics") that doesn't fully match a temple caretaker's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("She felt," "She showed them") during the consciousness exchange and some abstract phrasing ("deep-time memories") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The copper wire network as biological-technological interface offers a fresh angle on the communication-with-nature trope. The specific synthesis of temple architecture as amplifier with metallurgical conductivity feels earned. Loses some points for relying on familiar "dying person's final act" framework without significant transformation.</comment>
