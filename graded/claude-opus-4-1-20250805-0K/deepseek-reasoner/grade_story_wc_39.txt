<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "become the translator between generations" drives concrete actions throughout, from collecting sounds to reconstructing the music box's lost melody. His wistful melancholy and methodical jar-collecting reveal consistent character under pressure, though the internal conflict could be more contradictory in scene rather than purely accumulative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design where disparate sounds cohere into a new symphony that resurrects the music box's voice—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the lonesome splendor becomes "shared, magnificent inheritance"). The poet's "gleaned redemption" lands through service rather than personal transformation, with the final crystalline note joining the translation as tangible proof of success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The feral loft's construction from "driftwood and forgotten things" mirrors the poet's salvage work, while the beach provides the raw materials (foghorn, sandpipers, grass) that constrain his composition choices. Setting actively shapes the final symphony—each captured sound carries its coastal origin into the new melody.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation as the poet layers increasingly personal sounds (distant foghorn → nearby birds → his own heartbeat), with the stakes crystallizing when he must reconcile their dissonance into harmony. The cost is legible in his role as "bridge" and "translator," though the conflict lacks a sharp reversal or opposing force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the act of translation itself—not fixing the past but giving it "a new voice, allowing it to speak to the future." The music box's original note joining the captured symphony creates resonant synthesis without stating a moral, transforming isolation into "shared, magnificent inheritance."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("the world was still a secret") and consistent POV that filters the beach through the poet's salvage consciousness. The perceptual signature shows in how he experiences sounds as collectible objects, though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("nascent light," "lonesome splendor").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting appears ("spectral figure," "clinking glass treasure"). Some template phrasing in the collection sequence ("First, he captured... Next, he chased...") creates mechanical cadence that briefly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of capturing sounds in jars to reconstruct lost music offers fresh specificity, transforming the restoration trope through concrete method. The synthesis of natural sounds into the box's "soul, translated" feels earned, though the vagrant poet archetype itself is familiar.</comment>
