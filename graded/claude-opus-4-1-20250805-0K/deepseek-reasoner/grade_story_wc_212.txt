I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of image and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's understanding of time's value crystallizes through the act of preservation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action - the orbital dance gathering scattered light shows internal conflict between acceptance and preservation. The final realization about time's granular texture earned through her focused work provides genuine character insight. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around "furiously tranquil focus" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's understanding of inheritance shifts from passive waiting to active participation - "she had truly received it" with visible cost in the ice's return. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this crystallized understanding. Slight deduction for the middle section's pacing where the vortex's instability could be more immediately dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The icebound atrium functions as both constraint and resource - the geothermal stone enables life while the encroaching ice creates urgency. Excellent use of the acorn cap as micro-setting that constrains the solution. The starlight bending into her work and frosting her shoulders integrates environment with action particularly well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preservation duty to active crisis when the vortex begins dissipating, forcing Elara from passive tending to impossible action. The cost is visible in the ice's return and the "texture of borrowed time" she must physically feel. Could strengthen the middle tension as the vortex frays - the threat dissipates somewhat abstractly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of inheritance as active reception rather than passive transfer. The final insight about time's value residing "not in its length, but in the care taken with every single grain" resonates without moralizing. The vortex-as-phenomenon rather than creature cleverly subverts expectations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature - Elara notices in terms of cycles, textures, and concentrated potential. The prose modulates effectively from meditative opening to urgent action. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("profound, quiet power") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "texture" and "inheritance" that builds meaning. Some figurative density in peak moments ("wild serenity," "controlled storm of intention") borders on overwriting. The "granular" description of time effectively makes abstract concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving with entropy reversal creates an original premise. The vortex as "concentrated potential" rather than standard magical object shows conceptual originality. The specific image of starlight bending into the work elevates familiar post-apocalyptic elements through precise detail.</comment>
