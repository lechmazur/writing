<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical reaction to dishonesty ("wilts near dishonesty"), creating genuine vulnerability that drives the plot. The vision sequence shows contradictory impulses acting in scene as she bridges truth and lie. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of "reclaim the light stolen by midnight" which could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the music box's restoration literally produces light that pushes back shadows, with visible cost in Elara's physical wilting. The tethering sequence provides causal linkage between diagnosis and cure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the "covenant of rust" constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Resonance Chamber functions as more than setting—its spherical acoustics amplify meaning and enable Elara's diagnostic method. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("fingers stained with oil and time," "felt-lined drawer"). The philosopher's stone chip constrains choice and charges the final image when light spills from the repaired box.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening discovery: broken gear → shadow on mainspring → tethering to source → confronting the lie's origin. The dominant stake (restoring truth to corrupted objects) tightens when Elara must risk her own spirit. Cost is visible in her physical wilting and spiritual nausea, with the final light reclamation foreclosing the path of dishonesty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the corruption of love into shame that physically distorts objects. The final image of light spilling from the restored box offers a non-literal answer about truth's restoration. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of "light stolen by midnight" metaphor, though it pays off through the actual light produced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "tinkersong" metaphor and Elara's synesthetic hearing of "discord in its soul." Voice maintains consistency through technical precision mixed with mystical awareness. Some elevated diction ("covenant of rust," "philosopher's stone") fits the fantastical setting but occasionally drifts toward the ornate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("fingers, stained with oil and time, danced") and some abstract phrasing ("metaphorical darkness that seeped"). The "explain-everything" tendency appears in phrases like "a metaphorical darkness" rather than letting the image work alone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork repair with spiritual diagnosis creates an original angle on the craftsman archetype. The specific detail of hearing "discord in its soul" and the concrete manifestation of lies as shadows elevates beyond template fantasy. The covenant's double-edged nature (vulnerability as diagnostic tool) adds complexity.</comment>
