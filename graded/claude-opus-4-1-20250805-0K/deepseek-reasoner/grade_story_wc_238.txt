<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in Elara's shame/determination and Leo's grief/resistance, with the final reconnection earned through the induced current sequence. The "imperfect miracle" lands with visible emotional cost in Leo's tears and tentative acceptance, though the resolution edges toward therapeutic tidiness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through sensory accumulation (scent, music, light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Leo's stance shifts from closed rejection to tentative reconnection. Cost is visible in the decade-old wound and the orchard's imminent destruction, though the magical mechanism slightly dilutes earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive as "cathedral of forgotten sound" and the orchard's presence through scent effectively constrain choices and charge the final image. The induced perfume-to-music transformation creates genuine atmosphere, though some descriptions ("dust and decaying paper") trend generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from apology rejection to spectral manifestation to Leo's emotional breakthrough. The orchard's dawn deadline creates urgency, though the magical resolution arrives without sufficient resistance or complication to fully test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "imperfect miracle" theme emerges organically through the incomplete sonata becoming luminous music, with the orchard's destruction/preservation paradox resonating beyond plot. "Some silences aren't empty" effectively reweights the opening silence, though the metaphorical advice edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elara's self-aware inadequacy ("words inadequate and long past their expiration date") and controlled psychic distance shifts. The metaphorical advice maintains voice consistency, though Leo's minimal dialogue prevents full character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong moments ("last light bled from the sky"), though some template constructions appear ("She reached for...She began to pull"). Information density is generally high, but filter constructions ("she did not offer") occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-as-exorcist premise offers genuine freshness, with the induced current technique providing a non-obvious synthesis of emotional and supernatural elements. The specific transformation of perfume into music through channeled regret shows risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
