<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character-specific interiority with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("regret softened, not disappearing, but transforming into a dull, useful tool"). The ghost negotiation creates genuine internal conflict between letting go and keeping ambition. Minor deduction for the ghost's dialogue occasionally drifting toward diagnostic clarity ("I am not your regret. I am your blueprint").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara accepts partnership with her past rather than freedom from it, with visible cost in "weightless, perfect burden." The ghost revelation that she needs her blueprint self lands with earned weight. Minor orientation delay (who/where crystallizes slowly) and some causality softness in how the camera transforms from offering to returned possession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon setting with its halted carousel and cloud-moss creates vivid atmosphere that mirrors the temporal confusion. The disposable camera functions as micro-setting, constraining the negotiation. Setting doesn't quite reach 9+ because while atmospheric, it doesn't decisively constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on negotiating release from past ambition, with meaningful deepening when the ghost reveals itself as blueprint rather than regret. The transformation from seeking freedom to accepting partnership creates genuine cost. Escalation is more textural accumulation than causal tightening, appropriate for the lens but lacking a sharp pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ghost-as-blueprint revelation and the camera's "pictures that were never taken." The ending reweights eroded ambition as foundation rather than failure. Slight deduction for the ghost's overly articulate thesis statement, though it's partially saved by the concrete image work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and evocative phrasing ("temporal soup of her perception"). The chronological confusion is well-integrated into perception. Dialogue between Elara and ghost maintains subtext about time and potential. Minor voice convergence when the ghost speaks with excessive clarity for a spectral memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fractured stillness," "kinetic lagoon"). Some filter verb accumulation ("She could never be sure," "She had heard") and occasional overwriting in figurative density. The "temporal soup" and similar metaphors occasionally strain but don't break clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-blueprint rather than ghost-as-regret offers a fresh angle on self-confrontation. The disposable camera holding "pictures that were never taken" is conceptually striking. The negotiation framework for internal reconciliation shows originality, though some elements feel workshopped.</comment>
