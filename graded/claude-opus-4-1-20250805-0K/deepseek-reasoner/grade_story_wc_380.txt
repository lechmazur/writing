I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an **Accumulative/Textural** piece. The story builds through layered discoveries and pattern accumulation (coffee grounds → journey → crystal chamber → memory revelation), with the closure arriving through density increase and conceptual reweighting rather than causal conflict resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation crystallizes beautifully through the whale trigger and his methodical pursuit, with concrete embodiment ("hands like worn rope," navigating gravity by "the feel of his own bones"). The final choice to leave with "terrible, beautiful knowing" shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "aching need" early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where deleted memories as gravity-creating fossils reweights the entire world's physics—"The whale's beaching had been a symptom." The cost lands viscerally: "his path home would be harder, the gravity pulling at him with the weight of a thousand forgotten things." Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity from "hiss of gas and soft click of the igniter" through the gravity pockets to the salt chamber's "profound void of sound." The fluctuating gravity fields constrain navigation choices throughout ("scrambling for purchase on the air"), and the crystal chamber setting directly enables the revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: pattern recognition → arduous journey → discovery → understanding → acceptance of burden. The gravity pockets provide consistent physical stakes while the emotional stakes deepen. The "terrible, beautiful knowing" carries clear cost, though agency is more revelatory than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory's physical weight emerges organically through concrete discovery—memories literally create gravity distortions. The whale as "massive release of ancestral memory" and Silas becoming "keeper of the darkness within" resonates without stating morals. The pressed wildflowers as "catalogue of other people's lost loves" adds poignant specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("gleaming silence," "smooth stones in a pocket"). The prose modulates effectively from meditative opening through journey urgency to sacred chamber quietude. Perceptual signature strong: Silas notices through his lantern-lighter's precision and tactile awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—nearly every line advances discovery or atmosphere. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the gravity navigation sequence. Minor repetition of "gleaming silence" works as purposeful bookending. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis linking deleted memories to physical gravity distortions—a fresh conceptual framework executed with specificity. The coffee ground divination method and salt crystal preservation system feel inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking in the conceptual premise pays off through grounded sensory detail. +0.3 for conceptual boldness.</comment>
