I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows a because/therefore chain from discovering diaries to finding the negative, with each discovery narrowing Elara's options toward recovering Lysander's final work.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes from abstract (what walls dream) to concrete (recovering Lysander's legacy) through embodied discovery. The shift from acoustic mapping to tactile searching shows genuine struggle, though Lysander remains more vivid in absence than Elara in presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Decisive Change lands with visible cost: Elara accepts the burden of carrying another's legacy, transforming from observer to keeper. The causal chain from diary discovery through acoustic clues to hidden negative holds firmly, with the final image reweighting her role from cartographer to memory-bearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The manor's decomposition constrains every choice - from the "thick and still" air to the "sighing corner" that yields the secret. The film negative's panoramic view contrasts powerfully with the current decay, making setting essential to both search and revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional curiosity through empathetic connection to accepting custodianship. The acoustic expertise enabling discovery creates earned agency, though the search itself lacks a competing pressure or time constraint that would heighten tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending delivers a resonant answer: walls dream of "the soul within" their architecture - the ghostly family forms "woven into the very architecture they had built." This transforms Elara's whimsical question into profound truth about preservation and memory without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision ("corridor echo cartographer," "acoustic anomaly") while allowing poetic perception ("walls dream," "being slowly digested"). The shift to Lysander's "tight, frantic script" provides textural contrast, though Elara's interiority could be more distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with selective density ("ivy-veiled passages," "being slowly digested by the relentless green"). Some filter verbs cluster mid-story ("She felt the weight," "she saw it was"), and "burden of its legacy" appears twice, creating minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The profession of "corridor echo cartographer" after climate shifts offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of acoustic mapping with archaeological discovery, culminating in ghostly family portraits "woven into the very architecture," transforms the treasure-hunt trope through specific technical and emotional detail.</comment>
