<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—her fingers adjusting dials by feel rather than calculation, the shift from "forcing" to "understanding" the lock. The internal progression from doubt to empathy to certainty earns the final choice, though the epiphany about connection versus acquisition could use more embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong causal drive: the quest to open the diary leads through failed attempts, an empathy-driven insight, then success revealing grandfather's words that reframe her entire project. The closure lands with clear emotional cost—abandoning her catalog for human connection. Minor dock for the slightly convenient timing with the fireworks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop's "strange devices" and crystalline resonators constrain Elara's method effectively, while the diary clasp as "tiny, stubborn sentinel" charges the central conflict. The fireworks provide temporal pressure and ironic counterpoint. Spatial choreography is clean though the workshop could be more distinctly rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical challenge through doubt ("Was this alchemy instead of science?") to the empathy breakthrough that enables success. The cost is legible—she abandons her silence catalog for human connection. The fireworks deadline adds pressure though coincidence slightly weakens the resolution timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of using sound to unlock silence, culminating in grandfather's line about unspoken words being louder than war. The final image—reading while ignoring the very silence she meant to catalog—offers resonant answer without moralizing. The shift from "acquisition to connection" deepens thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara experiences sound through pressure and absence ("the silence within the hum"). Voice modulates effectively from technical precision to emotional vulnerability. Minor dock for slight register elevation in "theatrical sincerity" passages that doesn't fully match her tactile, intuitive nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the loudest sound in the world" for the soft click). Some figurative density in emotional beats ("wave of theatrical sincerity") and occasional abstract phrasing ("profound and earnest gravity") slightly slow momentum. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging silence varieties is fresh, as is opening a lock through resonance rather than force. The grandfather's diary as emotional key avoids sentimentality through specific detail. The transformation from technical pursuit to human connection feels earned though the setup is somewhat familiar.</comment>
