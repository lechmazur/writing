I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is primarily an **Accumulative/Textural** piece, building density through ritual imagery, astronomical alignment, and the ceremonial weight of ending war. The closure operates through resonant reconfiguration rather than causal reversal.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through physical details (calloused but gentle hands, weary eyes). The internal conflict between hope's vulnerability and the weight of responsibility plays out concretely. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "flawed beauty" and thematic statements that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure with visible cost ("half a sob," "no cheers"). The ritual completion creates irreversible change with clear before/after. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building toward the ceremonial moment. Orientation anchors established early and maintained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace setting constrains the ritual timing and provides spatial choreography. The scarred valley mirrors theme effectively. The astronomical alignment creates genuine urgency. Slight deduction for some generic war-torn landscape description that could be more specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through astronomical deadline pressure and the ritual's irreversibility. The "compound interest of grief, humility, and hope" creates layered cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when they unite despite being former enemies. Agency manifests through completing the ceremony despite its emotional toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "flawed beauty" of peace built on violence's scars. The final image of "tentative steps into peace" resonates without moralizing. The clipboard's transformation from tool to "beautiful, empty object" encapsulates the theme's complexity perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("compound interest of grief"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful. Some filter phrases ("She saw," "Elara watched") could be trimmed. POV remains stable and controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("testament to flawed beauty," "terrifying vulnerability of hope") that could be more concrete. Some repetitive sentence structures in the middle section. The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion and clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The peace negotiation through astronomical ritual offers a fresh angle on war endings. The specificity of the clipboard's mother-of-pearl constellations and the requirement for celestial alignment distinguishes this from generic peace treaties. The emotional complexity of former enemies sharing grief elevates beyond standard reconciliation narratives.</comment>
