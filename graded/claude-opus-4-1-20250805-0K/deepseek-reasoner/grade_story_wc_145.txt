<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from academic cartographer to witness/herald is earned through concrete discovery, with her dry-witted precision giving way to "solemn duty." The shift from seeking geographical sources to understanding absence itself as origin shows genuine internal conflict resolved with visible cost—her entire professional identity reconfigured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through condensation patterns, black ice convergence, and the frozen city revelation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes herald rather than finder. The cost is legible: she abandons her quest's original terms to serve a larger purpose, with "the world waking from its long hold" crystallizing the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake's transformation from "fractured white" to "obsidian ice" revealing the suspended city beneath constrains Elara's understanding and forces her reconfiguration. The ephemeral condensation maps that mirror her final drawing effectively make the environment participatory in closure, though some middle passages lean descriptive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation moves from worrying tranquility through "profound silence" to the city's revelation, with each stage narrowing Elara's options from academic pursuit to witness duty. The ice-fisher's single word "the before-place" crystallizes the stakes, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of origins-as-absence rather than presence emerges organically through the frozen city discovery, with the condensation patterns providing a resonant motif for temporary versus permanent cartography. The final image of Elara drawing "not what was, but what she had seen below" while frost mirrors her movements offers a non-literal answer to the source question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains Elara's cartographer's precision ("fleeting bruise against twilight," "temporary cartography") while modulating effectively under revelation. The controlled shift from analytical distance to participatory witness shows strong POV management, though occasional elevated diction ("visceral," "profound") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and effective image density, particularly in "gaunt silhouette," "frost-ferned map," and "obsidian ice." Minor redundancy in explaining the ice-fisher's word after showing it ("It meant 'the before-place'") and some abstract phrasing ("worrying tranquility") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of sources as absence/freezing rather than flow inverts expected quest logic effectively, and the frozen city as "before-place" offers genuine surprise. The synthesis of cartography with witness-duty feels earned, though the revelation mechanism through perfect ice transparency follows somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>
