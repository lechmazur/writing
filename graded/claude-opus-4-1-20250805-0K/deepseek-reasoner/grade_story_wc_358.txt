<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "cultivate foresight in action" drives his methodical investigation through embodied details like his "rapidly adapting gait" and systematic wind documentation. The frozen townspeople create genuine stakes, though the internal conflict could deepen beyond professional duty. His discovery process shows competence balanced with struggle as he pieces together the acoustic weapon theory from wind patterns and the flight engineer's patch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive where wind mapping leads to infrasound theory, which drives navigation to the epicenter and resolution. The closure lands with Decisive Change—Elias disconnects the power, stopping the acoustic weapon—with clear cost visible in the catatonic townspeople. The flight engineer's patch functions as a crucial clue linking to the experimental engine. Minor deduction for the convenience of the backup battery powering the engine indefinitely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container maze functions as both setting and acoustic amplifier, directly constraining Elias's navigation and creating the story's central problem. Vivid sensory work: "rust-colored canyon," air that "stuttered, hiccupped, and swirled," teeth-aching pressure at the epicenter. The setting actively shapes every choice and enables the closure when Elias uses his wind map to navigate the "treacherous acoustic eddies."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mysterious silence to discovering catatonic victims to identifying the deadly acoustic weapon. Elias's agency drives the investigation through systematic data gathering and pattern recognition. The cost is visible in the suspended townspeople, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once he identifies the source—pulling the power coupling meets little resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the collision of accidental catastrophe and systematic investigation—how unintended consequences of technology can create mass harm. The flight engineer's patch resonates as "a relic from another world of failure," linking past expertise to present disaster. The ending's "natural quiet waiting to be filled" offers subtle hope without moralizing, though the thematic complexity could deepen beyond accident-as-disaster.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with technical precision ("anemometer," "infrasound resonance") filtered through Elias's investigative perspective. Strong perceptual signature in how he reads wind patterns as data and interprets the environment through his expertise. The prose modulates effectively from clinical observation to visceral discovery ("teeth ache"). Minor filter verb clustering in middle sections slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with strong information density—most sentences advance investigation, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Effective rhythm variation between technical passages and visceral moments. Some repetitive constructions around wind description ("The wind didn't flow; it stuttered") and occasional filter verbs ("He pictured it," "He remembered") create minor drag but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The infrasound-as-weapon concept offers a fresh take on mass catastrophe, grounded in plausible physics. The container maze as acoustic amplifier shows ingenuity in using mundane infrastructure for extraordinary effect. However, the accident investigator solving an acoustic mystery feels somewhat predictable, and the resolution mechanism (unplugging the power) lacks the innovation shown in the setup.</comment>
