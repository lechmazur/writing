I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This operates as a **Causal** story - Leo's discovery of the radio confession drives him to investigate, leading to the valve release that provides absolution. The because/therefore linkage is clear throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's religiously skeptical nature creates genuine tension with his need to validate the ghost confession, and his physical strain against the valve wheel embodies internal conflict effectively. The motivation crystallizes clearly ("to find the weight of that swallowed truth"), though the emotional complexity could deepen further in the ghost shift manifestation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from radio confession → tunnel exploration → valve discovery → release/absolution, with the Resonant Reconfiguration landing powerfully as "the immense, quiet burden of absolution." The cost is felt through Leo's physical exhaustion and the weight of truth he now carries. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the radio's temporal nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The boiler room as "cathedral of decay" with its sub-auditory hum vibrating in teeth creates visceral atmosphere, and the tunnel/mill setting directly constrains Leo's choices and enables the discovery. The beaded valve wheel serves as both specific detail and crucial plot mechanism, while sensory details (hot air, rust smell, phantom din) heighten pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from skeptical curiosity to physical struggle with the sealed valve while phantom pressure builds ("It was all happening again, right now, forever"). The ghost shift manifestation creates meaningful pressure that forces Leo's decisive action, with visible cost in his physical exhaustion and emotional burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of buried truth demanding release emerges organically through the sealed valve metaphor and phantom shift pressure. "The immense, quiet burden of absolution" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, and the story explores the weight of secrets through concrete action rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with phrases like "the hush...is a physical thing, a thick and smothering velvet" and controlled psychic distance that tightens during the ghost shift manifestation. Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("religiously skeptical," "paradoxical blend") slightly exceeds the character's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("grimy glass beads," "scream of tearing metal"), but some overwriting appears in descriptive passages ("paradoxical blend of bone-deep fatigue and hyper-vigilant focus"). Minor scaffold in explaining Leo's method rather than showing it in action initially.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ghost shift manifesting as pressure/sound rather than visible specters offers a fresh take on supernatural investigation, and the radio psychic calls as conduit for dead confessions shows originality. The specific detail of the beaded valve wheel and the physical struggle for absolution elevate beyond typical ghost story patterns.</comment>
