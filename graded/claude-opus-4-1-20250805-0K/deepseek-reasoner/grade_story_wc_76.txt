<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and builds from the hunger stone's appearance through his counter-clockwise worldview to the final triumph. His "bleak exhilaration" embodies contradictory impulses effectively. The transformation from dousing the lighthouse to accessing "the clockwork behind the clockwork" shows earned change with visible cost—though the emotional/physical price could be more embodied in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught counter-clockwise logic building to a Conceptual Repricing where Elias accesses "paths not walked." The yoyo-as-key discovery drives causal linkage. Cost is conceptual—the "terrible and beautiful potential" of untaken choices—though a more visceral price would strengthen the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse workshop with "suspended pendulums and gears that moved against the common flow" constrains Elias's method beautifully. The hunger stone's warning creates atmospheric pressure. However, the island setting could apply more physical constraint to choices, and sensory detail beyond the visual would deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal obsession through the assembly sequence to accessing time's source—"the energy of paths not walked." The pressure tightens as physics protests and latent radiance appears. Cost emerges in the "terrible and beautiful potential" though the physical/emotional toll on Elias could be more dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the counter-clockwise metaphor and crystallizes in "paths not walked, the power of time itself, held in reserve." The hunger stone's warning transforms from portent to "one data point in a vast equation." The ending reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "neatly inventive" and the mirror-mind seeing "decay as renewal." Strong control in technical passages like "concentric patterns" and "coalescence of possibility." Some elevated diction ("recalcitrant beginning," "latent radiance") slightly strains the POV's workshop-tinkerer lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some elevated register drift ("coalescence of possibility," "nascent star"). Information density is high in the assembly sequence. Minor redundancy in explaining the yoyo's purpose twice. The final paragraph's "terrible and beautiful" and repeated "clockwork" phrases edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The counter-clockwise clock maker concept is genuinely fresh, transforming time-manipulation tropes through specific mechanical detail. The yoyo-as-orrery discovery and lighthouse-as-lock synthesis feel earned. Risk-taking in the conceptual ending—accessing unused possibilities rather than simple time travel—heightens stakes (+0.4 within band).</comment>
