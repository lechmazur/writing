I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory details and pattern recognition, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms from translator to keeper.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and deepens from intellectual pursuit to embodied experience. The transformation from "translator of things unseen" to "keeper of their light" is earned through concrete action with the lens fragment. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract opening characterization that takes time to ground in specifics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's role fundamentally shifts with visible emotional cost ("Her history, overlooked and vital, was now honored within me"). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the transformative moment. The orientation is clear by ~100 words with the alchemist's market setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("ozone, rare herbs, and the metallic tang of possibility"). The lighthouse painting and lens fragment work as micro-settings that constrain and enable the key discovery. Slight deduction for the painting's interior being somewhat generic coastal imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) intensifies through the lens discovery and painting examination, culminating in the protagonist taking on the keeper's daughter's story. The escalation follows the accumulative pattern well, though the middle section could tighten slightly between finding the lens and discovering the painting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the progression from translation to keeping, with the lighthouse serving as a perfect metaphor for illuminating hidden histories. The final transformation offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor the overlooked. The "eternal instant" achieves thematic resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled, literary diction appropriate to the translator-protagonist. The perceptual signature is consistent ("cartographer of spaces between"). Minor register elevation in places ("elusively tangible") that slightly strains naturalism but serves the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("web of rope bridges and suspended platforms") and there's occasional abstraction ("the weight of entire cultures"). The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion and clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of translator-as-lighthouse-keeper offers a fresh angle on the familiar theme of preserving forgotten stories. The specific detail of using a lighthouse lens fragment to read hidden histories in paintings shows genuine ingenuity. The market setting and magical realism elements are handled with originality.</comment>
