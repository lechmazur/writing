<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's quiet sorrow and fractured heart manifest through concrete actions—his reverent handling of files, studying dust patterns, and final transformation from monument to loss to vessel for kindness. The emotional progression from penance to gratitude lands with earned cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("tactfully hopeful diligence").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns, file examination, and discovered artifacts build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas's heart transforms from "monument to loss" to "vessel" for others' histories. The photograph discovery provides decisive change with visible cost (sixty years of separation), and the final image of continuing work despite falling dust crystallizes new purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The file room as "silent, dusty cathedral" anchors setting immediately, with dust patterns becoming investigative tools that constrain how Silas reads the past. The button's weight "disproportionate to its size" and the photograph's exact fit in the clean rectangle create tactile specificity that drives discovery, though broader sensory detail remains limited.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archival order through mystery (button discovery) to human connection (Miller seeking boy) to resolution (photograph proof), with each discovery narrowing possibilities. The dust patterns create genuine investigative pressure, and Silas's transformation from processing files to understanding their human weight carries emotional cost, though physical stakes remain modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated particulars—the button, marginal notation, photograph—building to "every small act that ever built a world" without stating a moral. The transformation of dust from neglect's marker to pattern-holder of kindness, and Silas's shift from penance to prayer, offers resonant answer to how small kindnesses magnify across time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac register with controlled rhythm ("a silent, dusty cathedral of unknown histories") and selective perception focused on archival details and dust patterns. The prose modulates from reverent quietness through quickened discovery to peaceful resolution, though occasional abstractions ("tactfully hopeful diligence") slightly blur the POV's texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror Silas's discoveries, with lines like "The dust would continue to fall, but he would always look for the patterns within it" doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("fractured mosaic of what might have been," "monument to loss") and repetitive constructions around dust weaken precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dust-pattern forensics offer fresh angle on archival discovery, transforming routine file processing into archaeological detection. The specific synthesis of military button, marginal notation, and photograph creates non-obvious resolution, though the emotional arc from loss to purpose follows familiar redemptive patterns.</comment>
