<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation to guard defiance is clear and embodied through concrete actions under pressure. His internal conflict between preservation and action plays out viscerally in the garden destruction scene. The final choice to sacrifice the code to save the coders shows genuine cost, though some interior passages rely on abstract phrasing ("vibrant garden of unregistered ideas") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive: thought-tax leads to secret language development, which leads to garden-code system, which leads to detection and necessary destruction. The closure lands with Earned Stasis—Lysander's imprisonment that paradoxically spreads the rebellion shows clear cost and reconfiguration. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse's humid chaos of cricket sounds constrains Lysander's discovery of the communication method. The gardens-as-grid insight emerges from environmental pressure (drone light merging with greenhouse). However, the prison cell at the end functions more as abstract space than lived environment, missing sensory specificity that could charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds causally from learning cricket language to implementing garden code to detection by Auditors. The warping action under drone surveillance shows clear agency with immediate cost—destroying the beautiful code to protect the network. Stakes tighten when Auditors trace patterns back to source, forcing the decisive sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cricket's dispersal song and wildflower chaos—resistance through multiplication rather than preservation. The final image of Lysander as "a note in that song" resonates without stating a moral. The transformation from guarding individual defiance to releasing it into collective action reweights the opening premise with earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scholarly register with selective perception ("spectral green light," "converging chaos"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("The pattern is the message, but the noise is the meaning"). However, some passages drift into elevated diction that strains against urgency ("glorious, untraceable cacophony"), and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several passages contain abstract phrasing that slows momentum ("vibrant garden of unregistered ideas," "beautiful, converging chaos of pressure"). Template cadence appears in the final paragraph with repeated "of" constructions. The prose achieves strong moments (the cricket dispersal signal) but inconsistent density, with some sentences doing single jobs where compression would heighten effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The cricket-language-as-resistance-code offers fresh synthesis of surveillance dystopia. Using community gardens as camouflage for coded messages transforms both the dystopian and horticultural elements. The specific flower lexicon (basil for danger, lavender for safehouse) and gourd rattle encoder show genuine ingenuity, though the thought-tax premise itself echoes familiar territory.</comment>
