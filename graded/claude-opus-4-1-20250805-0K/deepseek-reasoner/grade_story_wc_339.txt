<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "quietly analytic" nature drives her interaction with the snow globe and thread-untangling, with embodied details like her methodical perception of memory strands. The final shift from hollow detachment to understanding "the intricate, painful physics of release" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for Mortimer's somewhat stock presentation despite the creative "kindly, tired archivist" framing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding of endings shifts from "closed doors" to necessary periods that allow narratives to be "read complete," with emotional cost paid through her processing of the radio operator's note. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages (discovery leads to hollowness → assignment → encounter → understanding). The ghost's release and Elara's transformed perspective on discovery provide dual closure with legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken library as "ghostly cathedral" with mahogany shelves swaying and books floating like "lethargic fish" creates vivid atmosphere that enables the discovery. The snow globe's perfect preservation amid decay provides crucial contrast that drives the plot. Setting constrains choice through the underwater environment requiring specialized equipment and creating isolation for the supernatural encounter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional detachment through supernatural encounter to personal transformation about the nature of endings. The thread-untangling sequence provides concrete pressure with "meticulous care" required to separate "threads of memory from the cord of binding regret." Cost is visible in the ghost's release and Elara's emotional shift, though the encounter with Death lacks sufficient resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the snow globe's missing figure and the radio operator's final message, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final insight that discoveries are "periods placed on sentences" reweights the opening's "closed door" metaphor without stating a thesis. Strong resonance between Amelia Earhart's discovery and the ghost's release, both exploring completion versus continuation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's analytical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "cataloging facts" and "data point in an unpredictable universe." Mortimer's formal diction ("Every ending has an address") distinguishes him effectively. Minor voice convergence when Elara's perception of the threads becomes more lyrical than her established register warrants, though this serves the supernatural moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the library description. Information density high in lines like "a story ended without a satisfying final chapter" that advance multiple threads. Deduction for filter-verb clustering ("she noted," "she perceived," "she separated") in the thread-untangling sequence and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("ghostly cathedral," "lethargic fish," "swirling motes").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea recovery with supernatural encounter, avoiding typical ghost story tropes through the professional framing. The snow globe as soul-container and memory threads as tangible strands show creative specificity. Mortimer as "tired archivist" rather than skeletal Death provides memorable variation, though the resolution follows somewhat predictable emotional arc.</comment>
