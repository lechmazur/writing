<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation emerges through embodied grief—the "constant, silent scream" of not-knowing—and her mathematical pursuit functions as a specific coping mechanism. The final realization that she must "quantify the love, not the loss" represents earned change through discovery, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("This was the cruel truth of her ambiguous loss").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through the ritual's failure to find her brother, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reinterprets the mosaic's damage as a record of love rather than absence. The cost is visible in her "wave of despair" and the acceptance that "the ambiguous loss remained, a variable that could never be solved."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with its dripping stalactites and mosaic stone creates atmospheric pressure, particularly when "each drop elongating into a shimmering thread" during the ritual. The chipped mosaic constrains Elara's method and ultimately reveals meaning through its damage patterns, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("vials of condensed moonlight").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking her brother's presence to confronting the void of his absence ("only the hollow zero of his loss"), forcing Elara to reconfigure her entire approach. The cost lands in her acceptance that she cannot solve for his return but can honor "the beautiful, complex equation his life had created."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between quantification and emotion, with the mosaic's fractures embodying how love persists through damage. The final insight—that her brother exists "not in the numbers themselves, but in the way they connected"—offers resonant closure without moralizing, though "buried optimism" feels slightly manufactured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "The dripping water slowed, each drop elongating into a shimmering thread." However, some constructions feel writerly rather than organic ("gently inventive," "profound quiet"), and filter phrases occasionally distance us from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The mathematics hadn't failed. It had been answering the wrong question") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("mineral-rich water," "resonant soil") and repetitive structures. Some passages edge toward purple prose without clear purpose, particularly in descriptive sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of quantifying emotion through magical mathematics offers a fresh angle on grief, and the mosaic-as-memory-map provides specific originality. However, the "lost sibling" frame and some fantasy elements feel familiar, saved primarily by the mathematical lens and the insight about measuring impact rather than absence.</comment>
