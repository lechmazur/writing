<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between duty and moral imperative creates genuine tension, with her final choice carrying visible cost. The immersive listening technique and her childhood memory of the library create specific, embodied characterization. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of her ability to understand dead languages with the exact recording she receives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with decisive closure through Elara's destruction of the recording—a clear Decisive Change with visible cost. The piece teaches its pattern of sound immersion early and pays it off when Elara discovers the apocalyptic frequency. The orientation anchors (orchard, skyscraper, after foghorn) establish setting efficiently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper creates an evocative juxtaposition, and sensory details (orange tree scent, velvet disquiet) support atmosphere. The wax cylinder's physical handling and melting provide tactile specificity. Setting doesn't quite constrain choice enough for 8+ band, though the isolation enables her solitary decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The escalation from routine archival work to discovering world-ending potential creates meaningful pressure under the Accumulative lens. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her choice to destroy rather than preserve. The cost—betraying her life's work as oath scribe—is legible and felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and protection, duty and conscience. The final image of Elara as "keeper of a void" resonantly reweights her role from archivist to guardian. The piece avoids moralizing while exploring the weight of knowledge and responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara experiences sound ("felt in her teeth," "aggregate whisper"). Prose rhythm modulates effectively during the immersion sequence, though some phrases edge toward purple ("velvet disquiet," "bed of stars").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("releasing a scent of honey and extinction"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("woolen silence," "velvet disquiet," "shroud") and occasional register elevation. The "curator of annihilation" phrase feels slightly forced. Information density is high and propulsion maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of archiving emotional frequencies rather than words offers fresh specificity. The twist of grief tuning to a universe-ending frequency transforms the expected confession trope. The synthesis of duty versus protection feels earned through Elara's specific profession and abilities.</comment>
