<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contemplative nature manifests through embodied craft and internal contradiction between preserving ice-armor and allowing thaw, with the final choice to abandon defensive coldness earned through concrete glass-making metaphors. The dramatic self-narration ("The gatherer must heat evenly") reveals character-specific coping through ritualized control. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "weighty lightness" and "thoughtfully spirited" formulations that edge toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through glass-craft parallels to emotional thaw, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara places the bookmark and abandons "icy armor" with visible cost ("ready to feel the sun's warmth directly, without filter"). The ice-sheet crash provides external catalyst that reframes the bookmark from ruin to loved artifact. Slight deduction for marginally abstract final lines about "occupied by a future."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control room with its ice-becoming-water window constrains and enables Elara's work, while the portable furnace amid "banks of dead switches" creates productive tension. The shattering ice sheet that floods the room with light directly precipitates the closure shift. Setting functions as active pressure throughout rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as external thaw mirrors internal melt, with the ice-sheet crash forcing stance crystallization about the bookmark and her frozen anger. The "race against this melt" creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in abandoning protective coldness, though the stakes could sharpen further through more concrete opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glass orbs as "safe zones for inquiry" literalize theme through craft, while the parallel between external thaw and internal ice-melt avoids heavy-handedness through specific embodiment. The bookmark's transformation from "map of losses" to "thing that had been loved" reweights the central question of preservation versus release. Final image of placing (not discarding) the bookmark achieves resonance without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through craft-specific diction ("gather," "marver," "punty rod," "pontil") and the self-conscious dramatic narration that reveals character psychology. The contemplative register holds consistently through emotional intensification. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("weighty lightness," "profound and paradoxical peace") that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong craft-specific vocabulary and varied sentence structure, but several abstract formulations weaken precision: "weighty lightness," "profound and paradoxical peace," "occupied by a future." The "violent, cracking, painful thawing heart" edges toward overwriting. Some filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt") could strengthen through direct perception.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-emotional-craftsperson angle freshly explores familiar thaw/freeze metaphors through specific technical process. The dramatic self-narration as coping mechanism adds originality. The parallel between crafting "safe zones for inquiry" and emotional protection shows conceptual coherence, though the resolution tends slightly toward expected emotional arithmetic.</comment>
