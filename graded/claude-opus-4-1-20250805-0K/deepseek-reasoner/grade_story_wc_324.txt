<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—protecting vulnerable voices—with embodied details like "a chill and a pull behind the ribs." Her persistent curiosity drives the central discovery and creates genuine cost when she commits to exposing historical truth. The character arc from routine tracer to incidental hero feels earned through concrete choices, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("This was incidental heroism") rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory layers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's promise transforms her role. The closure lands with clear cost—she must now speak publicly about buried crimes, departing from her "quiet profession." Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words, and the photograph-to-box discovery creates meaningful tightening that forecloses the spirit's peaceful departure without truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with shattered glass and skeletal plants creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors the fractured consciousness. Sensory details like "mossy tile" and "brass and Bakelite" hearing aid ground the supernatural elements. The hidden box beneath the orchid tile constrains choice effectively. Some descriptions lean ornamental ("thick, vaporous tendrils") without directly pressuring action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine spirit-tracing to uncovering murder and institutional corruption, with the spirit's peace contingent on truth being revealed. The hearing aid's weakening pulses create time pressure, and Elara's promise transforms her from listener to speaker with clear public cost. The dominant stake—protecting the vulnerable voice—tightens when that protection requires exposing dangerous truths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "incidental heroism"—routine duty unexpectedly demanding moral courage. The photograph transforms from love token to evidence of guilt, and the final image of Elara walking into light with "a chain of quiet actions that occasionally...shone a light" resonates without stating a moral. Minor deduction for the explicit "incidental heroism" label mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent gothic-professional register with selective perception fitting a spirit-tracer ("reeling hush," "fractured and terrified"). The spirit's fragmented dialogue carries authentic desperation. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("vaporous tendrils to coil around skeletal remains"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("Elara understood").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with atmospheric rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("thick, vaporous tendrils," "reeling hush"). The paraphrase loop "She had come to listen...She had come to ease a passing" weakens momentum. Strong information density in key beats like the hearing aid sequence, but occasional template cadence ("She would always listen. She would always assure them").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The contact tracer for hearts concept offers fresh supernatural procedural grounding, and the hearing aid as conduit for decades-old consciousness shows ingenuity. The twist from routine spirit work to murder investigation feels earned. Some elements trend familiar (photograph as memory anchor, buried evidence), though the synthesis of ghost story with institutional corruption creates originality.</comment>
