<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to solve the crisis through pattern recognition rather than passive waiting. Her "diligently curious" nature manifests through concrete actions—studying the phrasebook, examining the hopscotch board, translating patterns into music. The "sociable isolation" paradox works well, showing her polite but absorbed state. Deduction for slightly mechanical emotional progression and limited internal contradiction during the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive: stranded ship → Elara notices patterns → translates to music → restarts crystal. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost (three days stranded, risk of permanent drift). Orientation anchors effectively by line 3. Minor deduction for the convenient availability of a violinist and the somewhat rushed resolution mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The airship setting constrains choices effectively—the dead crystal creates genuine peril. Vivid details like "creaked and sighed," "starling murmurations," and the "frozen tear" crystal enhance atmosphere. The hopscotch board as micro-setting works well. Deduction for limited sensory range beyond visual and some generic descriptors ("low, anxious hum").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake: restart the crystal or drift forever. Escalation builds from observation to theory to action with genuine risk (failure means continued drift). The solution requires Elara's specific skills and the cost of three days stranded is felt. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution and limited complication after the discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic emergence through the discovery of "languages of the world" beyond human speech. The children's game encoding ancient navigation creates resonant layers. The ending effectively reweights Elara's role from apprentice seeking approval to pioneer of "unseen geographies." The fresh dog-ear symbolizes her transition from reader to writer of knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with good perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns others miss. Voice modulates well from observation to excitement during discovery. Some lovely phrases like "frozen tear" and "bright strand woven back." Deduction for occasional register elevation ("hieroglyphs across the twilight sky") and limited dialogue differentiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong images like "captured star-fragment" and "human tide flowing around fixed points of fear." Some overwriting in descriptive passages ("shifting hieroglyphs," "unseen geographies of energy and resonance"). Minor redundancy between "stranded" and "becalmed" in opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of children's games encoding ancient knowledge with the polyglot concept extended beyond human language. The specific solution—translating spatial patterns to musical notes—feels inventive. Risk-taking in the quiet, contemplative resolution rather than dramatic action elevates the piece. The transformation from map apprentice to pioneer of invisible forces shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
