<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation emerges through embodied perception and micro-choices (studying the box, following the ghost-woman's gaze, offering understanding without words). The final act of renunciation—placing the box and holding "the entirety of his understanding"—carries visible cost as he accepts the weight of unspoken words into himself. Minor deduction for slight emotional abstraction ("profound, sorrowful authority") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the covenant completes through Silas's wordless understanding, transforming both ghosts and protagonist. The cost lands tangibly: "the weight of those unspoken words now a part of him." Orientation anchors (beekeeping oasis, post-rupture world) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image—its transformation from "tangled" to "seamless whole" mirrors the covenant's completion. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("colored light," "gritty sand," "silent hexagonal chambers"), with the oasis serving as both physical space and thematic crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovery of box → ghost-woman's appearance → understanding the covenant's need → final offering. The dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) tightens when Silas realizes the covenant is "starving" and requires active intent, not passive preservation. Cost is visible in the protagonist accepting the weight permanently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the broken/restored covenant between keeper and kept resonates without exposition. The final image of Silas holding "tranquil, perceptive silence that was, finally, eloquent" reweights the opening's "mute eloquence" with earned transformation. Subtext operates through gesture and silence throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the world through Silas's "tranquilly perceptive" lens, with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative observation to the urgency of understanding. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that strains POV lexicon ("mute eloquence," "symbiotic oath") and slight register drift in technical moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("pale and shimmering," "silent, frantic ballet") and elevated diction that occasionally drifts from POV register ("tangible symbol of the symbiotic oath"). Some filter-verb clusters ("He understood," "He knew") dull immediacy in middle beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with beekeeping covenant creates non-obvious angle on familiar material. The ghost-bees as ethereal communicators and the stained glass box as covenant-container show specific imagination. Transformation of the "tangled covenant" concept through concrete dramatization elevates beyond template post-apocalyptic narrative.</comment>
