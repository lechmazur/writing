<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—liberating forgotten knowledge while understanding the dead scientist's encrypted grief. Her embodied response through dance effectively translates abstract code-breaking into physical expression, avoiding pure cerebral abstraction. The final choice between power and liberation creates genuine moral tension with visible cost (the lab flooding). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "vulnerability as strength" that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear closure: Elara chooses to take the die (burden) rather than leave it, triggering the lab's destruction but securing both the knowledge and the key. The cost is immediate and visible—she must flee the flooding structure. The narrative follows a clear because/therefore chain from code-breaking through dance to the final moral test. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final beat that could better weight the transformation of the die from "tool of execution" to "key."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting effectively constrains choices through the groaning pressure, reinforced dome, and ultimate flooding. The brass mechanism with its glass cage and the cold metal grating create tactile specificity. The environment directly shapes the ending when "water burst from seams in the ceiling." Slight deduction for missing sensory detail beyond visual and tactile that could deepen immersion during the dance sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear escalation from initial puzzle-solving through dance-translation to the final moral choice under time pressure. The hangman's dice creates genuine stakes—permanent sealing and ocean claiming its prize. The flooding lab raises immediate physical danger after the moral choice. Cost is visible when she must abandon the sinking structure while clutching her prizes. Minor deduction for predictable resolution pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: vulnerability transformed into strength via understanding rather than domination. The dance sequence embodies this—translating encrypted sorrow into graceful motion. The final image of the warm die as key rather than execution tool resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the overly explicit thematic statement "vulnerability that had, in the end, proven to be the greatest strength of all" in the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical register appropriate to the "lyrical code breaker" character. The dance description effectively uses embodied language: "arms flowed like currents," "sharp, precise turn." Some elegant phrasing like "calm defiance against the crushing pressure." Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV credibility ("brutalist lock," "recursive algorithm") and repetitive "calm defiance" phrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, especially in the dance sequence. Information density is good—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Deductions for redundant phrasing ("calm defiance" appears twice), some overwriting in metaphorical language ("spider spins its web" feels ornamental), and the final paragraph's abstract summary tendency rather than maintaining concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dance-as-code-breaking concept offers a fresh angle on the hacker/infiltrator trope. The moral test built into the security system adds complexity beyond simple puzzle-solving. The transformation of execution tool to liberation key provides thematic coherence. Moderate deduction for familiar underwater lab setting and relatively predictable "choose sacrifice over power" resolution that doesn't fully transform the genre template.</comment>
