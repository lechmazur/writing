<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent choices through the revelation that he's been unconsciously orchestrating a larger network. The internal contradiction between knowing/not-knowing creates genuine tension, though the epiphany at the lighthouse lacks sufficient embodied reaction to the terrifying clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkage from fortune cookie to lighthouse meeting, culminating in a Decisive Change where Leo accepts the conductor role. The accidentally prophetic cookie creating the very meeting it describes provides elegant circular causality with visible cost in his "old life receding."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse's rotating prisms and causeway exposed by tide create atmospheric pressure that shapes Leo's treacherous approach. The magnificent machine constrains the final choice effectively, though earlier diner scenes could use more selective sensory detail beyond ritual wiping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from simple delivery to revelation of Leo's true role, with the microdot specs transforming from burden to key. The dominant stake of understanding one's purpose tightens when Alistair reveals Leo has been conducting without knowing, though the acceptance lacks sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "open secret" concept—Leo discovering he's been the conductor all along without knowing it. The final image of stepping toward the controls while his old life recedes offers resonant answer to the central question of purpose without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("transpose," "orchestrate") that reflects Leo's cryptic profession, though some phrases like "terrifying, brilliant clarity" drift toward abstraction. Dialogue between Leo and Alistair carries appropriate subtext but could differentiate their registers more sharply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, but several abstract phrases weaken immediacy: "familiar enigma," "grand scheme," "terrifying clarity." The metaphor mixing of musical terms (transpose, orchestrate, symphony) with light/navigation occasionally strains coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The accidentally self-fulfilling prophecy mechanism offers fresh angle on fate/free will, with the fortune cookie writer discovering he's been writing navigation codes. The lighthouse as communication hub rather than mere warning beacon provides non-obvious transformation of familiar elements.</comment>
