<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo's transformation from inherited caretaker to remembering lover drives a credible arc with embodied reactions ("chill that was not of the eternal night"). Elara's "lovingly venomous precision" manifests through concrete whispered corrections that reveal protective care beneath criticism. The final choice to accept the bead despite terror shows clear cost ("profound grief for the life they were denied"), though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ghostly visits build toward resonant awakening, with the bead serving as decisive catalyst. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo's recovered memory transforms him from reluctant steward to purposeful healer with "warm weight of the carved stone bead." Cost is visible in Elara's dissolution and the permanent burden of "work, and his memory" in endless night. Minor orientation wobble with "lifetimes ago" revelation could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse of "gnarled, silver-barked trees that grew not fruit, but softly glowing, crystalline equations" creates distinctive atmosphere that constrains Leo's work. Setting actively shapes choice through "misaligned prism or an under-watered root" requiring specific tending. The "winter-cracked fields" beyond the glass provide stakes for the orchard's purpose, though some spatial choreography between trees could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from secret calendar marking to memory recovery to accepting permanent guardianship, with the bead touch as irreversible threshold. Leo's reaching "though terrified" shows agency overcoming fear with visible cost in accepting eternal duty. The "resonant awakenings" transform from mysterious debt to active healing work, though middle pressure could tighten slightly before the crystallizing moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of debt from cold obligation to "opportunity" for renewal. The crystalline equations growing on trees literalize abstract knowledge becoming tangible healing. Final image of Leo alone but "emptiness was gone" reweights isolation as purposeful solitude. Some thematic articulation ("debt was repaid not in kind, but in opportunity") edges toward explicit but remains grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains gothic register with controlled imagery ("memory of lace and regret," "silver-barked trees"). Perceptual signature shows through Leo's tactile awareness of supernatural presence before sight. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "resonant awakenings") occasionally strains against intimate POV moments, and syntactic patterns could vary more in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ashen-veil ghost bride, drifted between the gnarled, silver-barked trees"). Some register elevation in phrases like "profound grief" and "soaring joy" creates distance in peak emotional beats. Minor template cadence in "She had... She had kept" structure, though generally clean with good momentum through varied sentence lengths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with alchemical greenhouse growing equations creates non-obvious world. The reversal that Leo is the original lover, not just inheritor, reframes the entire dynamic. Specific detail like "carved stone bead, its surface etched with a pattern that seemed to shift" avoids generic supernatural tokens, though some emotional beats follow familiar patterns.</comment>
