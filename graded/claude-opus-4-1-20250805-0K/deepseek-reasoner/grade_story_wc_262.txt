I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from commission to discovery to delivery, with motivated ellipsis around the projectionist's identity.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and internal experience are grounded in specific sensory work ("fingertips on sprocket holes," "ink-stained fingers"). The projectionist's unexpressed love creates genuine internal contradiction. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in the resolution - the usher's immediate understanding feels convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear closure - the delivery of the long-delayed message creates a Decisive Change with visible emotional cost ("single tear"). The revelation that love is "stored in the act of creation" reweights the opening quest. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth and Orpheum theater constrain and enable the psychometry reading effectively. Sensory details ("dusty machinery," "warm glass," "golden light") are selective and purposeful. The setting directly enables the story's resolution through the preserved film strip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake - finding where unused love is stored - drives consistent pressure through the psychometry reading to the revelation. The cost becomes legible when we understand the projectionist's fifty-year silence and the usher's lifetime of wondering. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vision shifts from observation to understanding the projectionist's solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "unused love" being stored not in place but in creative acts awaiting their audience. The final image of love "waiting" rather than "stored" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The forgotten lyrics finding their melody creates effective thematic layering without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's "spatially imaginative" talent shapes how she processes the psychometry ("pool of golden light," "tangible thing, bright and overwhelming"). Voice maintains consistency through transitions. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in places ("hushed thunder of a thousand past audiences").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("hushed thunder," "echoes steep"). Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple elements. Some template cadence in the vision sequence ("He saw," "He captured," "He had poured") costs points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of love stored in an unscreened film offers a fresh angle on unrequited love narratives. The psychometry mechanism and vintage cinema setting create specific texture. The transformation of "stored" to "waiting" provides meaningful reframing, though the resolution's emotional tidiness slightly reduces originality.</comment>
