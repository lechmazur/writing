I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered discoveries toward a conceptual repricing about humanity's collective trauma.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and method are clear and consistent, with her perceptive trait enabling concrete discoveries. The character arc from methodical historian to awakened diagnostician lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("terrible new weight") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds effectively through diary fragments to tapestry to revelation, landing a strong Conceptual Repricing where humanity's amnesia is diagnosed. The cost—species-wide catatonia—is conceptually clear though more felt immediacy would strengthen it. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silo library setting actively shapes discovery through its circular tiers and hidden artifacts. Sensory details like "bronze quiet" and "metallic tang" create atmosphere while the fireplace yields crucial evidence. The setting constrains and enables Elara's archaeological method throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from collecting stories to diagnosing species-wide trauma, with the tapestry discovery forcing a paradigm shift. The escalation follows the accumulative lens well, though the final awakening mission feels slightly abstract rather than immediately pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of walls as memory-keepers and the concept of collective amnesia. The dragons-as-gravitational-forces reinterpretation is particularly strong. The ending's "one recovered word at a time" offers resonant hope without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the concept, with effective modulation during discovery moments ("struck her with the force of a physical blow"). Some phrases like "bronze quiet" achieve poetic resonance, though occasional abstractions ("terrible new weight") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong moments like "walls have heard, the whispers trapped in stone." Some abstract phrasing ("terrible new weight," "fortress for its final, waking thoughts") and slight repetition of "bronze quiet" create minor drag. Information density is good overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The core concept of planetary axis shift causing collective amnesia is genuinely original, transforming both geological disaster and mythological imagery into psychological diagnosis. The synthesis of medieval tapestry with astronomical catastrophe feels fresh and earned. Risk-taking in the conceptual ambition elevates this.</comment>
