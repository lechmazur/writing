I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from skeptic to believer is earned through embodied sensation and specific resistance ("the shell held her fast, not physically, but through resonance structures"). The internal shift from professional detachment to "ghostly resolve" tracks causally with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("translate this isolation into independence") in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Elara archives the trapped memory, transforming from skeptic to believer with clear cost (the night-long struggle, emotional toll). The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages. The resonance solution emerges from established mechanics rather than convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet garden with night-blooming jasmine and the workshop with tuning forks create atmospheric pressure. The shell's mother-of-pearl interior and crystalline resonance structures constrain Elara's choices. Setting actively participates in the resolution through the crystals arranged for harmonic counter-frequency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional restoration to freeing a trapped soul, with clear tightening when Elara realizes breaking the shell might "shatter the memory into nothingness." The night-long trial-and-error sequence shows cost through "each failed note a brush with the shipwreck's despair." Agency drives the resolution through Elara's methodical harmonic solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of isolation-to-independence emerges through the trapped soul's journey and Elara's parallel transformation. The final image of the dark shell as "beautiful but inert" resonates without stating a moral. Some deduction for explicit thematic language ("translate this isolation into independence") that echoes prompt terms too directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization through Elara. Strong perceptual signature in how she notices materials and textures ("chipped porcelain and cracked varnish"). Prose modulates effectively during the vision sequence, though occasional register elevation ("tragically radiant smile") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Some figurative density in places ("velvet garden," "bleeding horizon") and minor repetition of "resonance" concepts, but clarity remains strong throughout. The harmonic resolution sequence maintains propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The resonance-based ghost release mechanism offers a fresh take on supernatural restoration. The specific solution through harmonic frequencies feels earned. However, the core haunted object premise is familiar, and some elements ("Tragic Radiance" ship name) feel convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>
