<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming dereliction into purpose—with concrete embodiment through her methodical work and focus. Her character-particular interiority ("a need to puzzle out new equations for hope") drives meaningful choices that culminate in the earned transformation of the terminal. Minor deduction for limited internal contradiction during the three-day work sequence where emotional complexity could deepen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the terminal's transformation from "stalled" to purposeful circulation carries visible cost through Elara's solitary labor and the contrast between past grandeur and present function. The "who, where, when" anchors establish clearly by line 3, and the drive lens holds consistently through density increase and pattern culmination in the steam/warmth imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional integration where setting constrains and enables every choice—the terminal's architecture becomes the solution's blueprint through capillary pipes, dome glass, and gantry vantage. The sextant functions as micro-setting that enables precise solar alignment. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout, with environmental details evolving causally as Elara repurposes each system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding functional purpose beyond demolition—escalates through discovery of the sextant, recognition of the capillary system's potential, and three days of solitary labor with visible cost. Agency manifests through Elara's decision to repurpose rather than report, with the final warming air as earned payoff. Slight limitation in that the conflict is primarily technical rather than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "maze of intentions" into singular purpose, with the sextant bridging navigation metaphors between void-ships and civil engineering. The final image of "the first genuine equation of hope" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "new equations for hope" through earned experience. The resurrection motif gains depth through the circulatory system metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with engineer-specific perception ("permacrete," "capillary pipes," technical calculations) and controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to focused work to quiet triumph. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("stoic wonder," "monumental task") that slightly exceeds the established pragmatic voice, and some filter verb clustering in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure, but several artifacts reduce the score: metaphor density in paragraph 2 ("graveyard of grandeur," "maze of intentions," "hopeful geometry"), some template cadence in the work sequence ("She cleaned... She felt... She watched"), and abstract phrasing ("carnival left town," "functional purpose") that could be more concrete. The closing achieves strong resonance despite these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering pragmatism with lyrical transformation—the greenhouse/light refinery concept feels specific and earned. The repurposing of derelict infrastructure through passive solar systems shows originality beyond typical abandonment narratives. Risk-taking in the quiet, technical closure pays off, though the "carnival left town" opening metaphor feels slightly derivative.</comment>
