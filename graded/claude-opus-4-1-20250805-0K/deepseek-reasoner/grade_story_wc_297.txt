I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's compulsion to find the "intersection of dreams" drives consistent choices through embodied details like her root-bound feet creating "small agony" and "small ecstasy" with each step. The character's purposeful curiosity manifests through concrete actions of pressing the topiary clipping to scars, though the final transformation lacks the contradictory impulses needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's binding transforms from "chains" to "threads in a grand tapestry," making visible cost through her permanent rootedness. The pattern of linking scars builds coherently to this reconfiguration, with the "anxious elation" settling into "quiet, potent joy" marking the decisive shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glade's "liquid sapphire one could drown in" creates visceral atmosphere that constrains movement through Elara's root-bound feet dragging through "luminescent moss." Setting actively shapes choices as she navigates from scar to scar, though it doesn't quite achieve the 9+ requirement of the environment decisively constraining the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation as each scar connection delivers "violent, beautiful shock" building toward the central nexus, with clear cost in Elara's physical pain and the permanent binding she accepts. The "anxious elation" modulates appropriately through the journey, though the resolution could show more immediate trade-off for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of linking scars as connectors rather than flaws, culminating in the resonant final image where Elara's binding becomes foundation rather than curse. The "intersection of dreams" transforms from place to state through earned realization, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm like "bark-like whorls" and "cobalt dust," though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("terrifying hope for what might be rebuilt") that strains the POV's grounding. The perceptual signature of someone root-bound comes through in movement descriptions but lacks the distinct rhythmic control under pressure needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The air itself was thick with anxious elation"), but suffers from abstract scaffolding like "cosmic adjustment" and "metaphysical wounds" that dulls immediacy. Some template cadence appears in the scar-linking sequence ("On she went, from scar to scar"), preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary concept offers fresh specificity, transforming typical chosen-one narrative through the physical constraint that becomes essential to the resolution. The synthesis of scars as connectors rather than flaws provides non-obvious insight, though the overall arc follows recognizable fantasy patterns without the bold risk-taking needed for 8.5+.</comment>
