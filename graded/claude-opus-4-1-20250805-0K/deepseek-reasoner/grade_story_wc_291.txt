<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia creates a compelling contradiction—she can't remember faces yet captures them perfectly—and her methodical approach under this constraint drives meaningful choices. The awakening of dormant empathy lands with genuine cost in "raw and aching connection forged in the void of her own blindness." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of the twin revelation, which could use more embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through drawing that culminates in the twin revelation and empathy awakening. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's emotional numbness transforms into "devastating wave of feeling," with visible cost in her slow packing and the "verdict" of sunlight. The twin deduction feels slightly convenient without more groundwork, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry setting functions as more than backdrop—its "bowl of furrowed hush" and "deep, watery cut" constrain the investigation and mirror Elara's emotional excavation. The mist coiling around ankles and sun striking "like a verdict" effectively charge the atmosphere. Slightly generic in places ("cold, grey breath") but the setting actively shapes mood and discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy through solving the case—progresses through methodical drawing that reveals the twin theory. The escalation from drawing ribbon to mask to face to realization follows accumulative logic, though the twin revelation arrives somewhat abruptly. Cost registers in Elara's emotional transformation but the investigative pressure could tighten more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of seeing truth "not in a face, but in the absence of one"—Elara's disability becomes her investigative strength. The unification of opposites (charmer/loner, blindness/sight) resonates without stating morals. The ending's "loneliness of a life erased" and empathy "forged in the void" offer genuine thematic weight through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong, consistent voice with controlled psychic distance and effective free indirect style ("a portrait artist who could not remember a single face"). Prose rhythm modulates appropriately—methodical during drawing, accelerating at revelation. The perceptual signature of someone who processes faces differently creates authentic texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful variation, though some elevated diction occasionally strains ("profoundly, incurably prosopagnosic"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple elements. Some abstract phrasing ("lance the wound," "drain the poison") could be more concrete, and a few redundancies appear ("profound flaw"/"profoundly prosopagnosic").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prosopagnosia concept offers genuine freshness—a face-blind portrait artist investigating through absence rather than presence. The twin revelation, while slightly convenient, grows from the "opposites" pattern established throughout. The story commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, creating something memorable from the cold case framework.</comment>
