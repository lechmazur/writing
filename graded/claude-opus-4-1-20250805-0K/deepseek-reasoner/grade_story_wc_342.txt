I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages from discovery to creation to realization.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's face blindness creating his drive to capture the infinite is a strong, specific motivation that compels every action. The final acceptance of limits shows genuine character movement with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "essence of things" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from search to discovery to creation to revelation, with the lens's failure delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration about limits. Cost is visible in the demolished library and lost perfection. The orientation anchors (hollow tree library, dawn deadline) land early and effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hollowed tree library is vividly specific with "dust-moted light" and "grooves...feeling the ghost of countless read pages." The setting constrains time (dawn demolition) and enables discovery (hidden journal). The lens crafting shows precise spatial awareness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from searching to crafting to witnessing the projection's failure as dawn arrives. The ticking clock of demolition creates genuine pressure. The lens breaking under full sunlight delivers meaningful cost, though the acceptance comes slightly too easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of limits emerges beautifully through the lens that can capture pre-dawn but not full sun - "the beautiful, heartbreaking limit of his own dream." The ending reweights the entire quest without stating a moral, finding truth in transience rather than permanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with "fractally precise" movements and selective attention to texture over faces. Some elevated diction ("nascent light," "coalesced") fits an artist's interiority. Minor register drift in places but maintains coherent perspective throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("silence was absolute, a physical weight"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The final image of "infinite, uncapturable blue" resonates perfectly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The face-blind artist seeking to capture infinity offers a fresh angle on artistic obsession. The hollow tree library and guild's perceptual secrets feel specific. However, the "artist confronting limits" arc follows familiar patterns without surprising transformation.</comment>
