<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by loneliness and the need to find meaning in the prophet's fragmented teachings. Her final choice to fracture the broadcast shows genuine internal conflict between fighting directly and preserving truth through dispersal. The transformation from scribe to active agent is earned through her despair at the message's corruption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of prophet's voice leads to archiving, which enables broadcasting, which triggers faction corruption, forcing Elara's final tactical shift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she fragments the signal into "a puzzle, unfolding forever," with visible cost in abandoning her singular authority. The orientation is clear by ~100 words with Elara alone in the Sky-Spire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico functions as both sanctuary and prison, constraining Elara's world while filtering her perception of reality below. The storm-lit observatory setting directly shapes her ability to broadcast during the storm and isolates her decisions. Sensory details like "lightning into sapphire shards" and "chalky rock" transcriptions ground the otherworldly setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding meaning) to public mission (broadcasting truth) to crisis (message corruption) to final renunciation of control. The Unified Dawn's signal jamming creates genuine pressure that forces Elara's tactical shift. Cost is visible when she surrenders her role as sole interpreter, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and broadcasting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "variant allegiance" - loyalty to multifaceted truth rather than singular doctrine. The final image of messages as "a puzzle, unfolding forever in the spaces between the signals" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. The cobalt portico transforms from barrier to lens, embodying the theme of perspective-shifting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's visionary role, with phrases like "ghost in the static" and "ancient shadows." The prophet's fragments carry distinct prophetic tone ("We are not one people, but a chorus of variants"). Some filter verbs in middle sections ("She felt a crushing despair") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong moments like "fractured the lightning into sapphire shards" and the final "puzzle, unfolding forever." Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor scaffold appears in transitions ("She spent her days and nights") and some abstract telling ("Her mission gained purpose") reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of corrupted transmission forcing dispersal rather than amplification offers a fresh angle on information warfare. The synthesis of radio prophet, atmospheric isolation, and variant allegiance creates a unique dystopian mythology. The final tactical choice to fragment rather than strengthen the signal subverts expected confrontation.</comment>
