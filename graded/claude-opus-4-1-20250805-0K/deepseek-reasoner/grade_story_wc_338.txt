<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity drives concrete actions throughout, from the video comparison method to her final decision to reseal the chapel. Her internal conflict between documentation and preservation crystallizes in the closure with visible cost—she sacrifices professional recognition to protect the sacred space. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("shielded openness") that doesn't fully embody in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered discoveries—the map's tear, the shadow discrepancy, the hidden chamber—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes guardian rather than documenter. The cost is legible: she forfeits academic glory for sacred preservation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the henge's relationship to the vault.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and ancient henge stones create atmospheric pressure while the shadow angle discovery constrains the solution path. The hidden chapel's "woven, petrified roots" forming a lattice provides vivid specificity. Deduction for some generic weather description ("never-ending sigh") and the setting doesn't quite force the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic restoration through the shadow discovery to the moral choice of preservation versus documentation. The final renunciation carries clear cost—Elara sacrifices professional advancement. However, the conflict lacks active opposition; the choice feels somewhat predetermined by her established empathy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between the mapmakers' protective erasure and Elara's final choice to maintain silence. The "tear" motif effectively bridges physical map, stone fissure, and knowledge gap. The ending reweights the entire narrative without explicit moralizing, though "keeper of a new-old secret" edges toward thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices shadows, angles, and silences others would miss. Strong control of psychic distance, especially in the discovery sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("aggregate of countless whispered prayers") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum through the discovery sequence. Information density is high in the shadow comparison section. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("shielded openness," "intrinsically linked"), some filter verb clustering ("she felt," "she believed," "she theorized"), and occasional overwriting in the chapel description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The video comparison method across fifty years provides fresh specificity to the archaeological mystery genre. The concept of protective erasure—hiding sacred spaces through deliberate cartographic omission—offers genuine insight. Slight deduction for familiar beats in the hidden chamber discovery despite the unique approach.</comment>
