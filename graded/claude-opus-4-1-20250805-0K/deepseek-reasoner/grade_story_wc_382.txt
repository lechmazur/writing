Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate each category precisely.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building density through layered metaphors of language, stone, and communion until the meteor shower catalyzes a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "remember something you think your blood still knows" creates compelling internal contradiction. The "agreed upon lies" between the characters generates authentic tension through what remains unspoken. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the desire to learn "the language of old buildings" which could use more embodied grounding in the opening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when Elara gains communion with the buildings through the seal-pressing moment, with Mrs. Gable's disappearance serving as the visible cost. The accumulative structure builds coherently through weekly lessons to the meteor-lit revelation. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden functions as more than setting—it's a "hidden world" that enables the teaching while the meteor shower provides the atmospheric pressure for transformation. The seal pressing into soil then stone creates tactile, lived-in interaction. The final image of the city whispering to Elara directly charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—gaining true understanding versus maintaining protective lies—deepens effectively through the meteor shower scene where Elara breaks their "biggest unspoken rule." The cost manifests in Mrs. Gable's disappearance, though the escalation could tighten further between the middle lessons and climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of lies/truth, dead/living language, and communion versus translation. The final realization that "the language of the old buildings was not about translation, but communion" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Mrs. Gable as ghost/last speaker adds thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with purposeful compression ("Their first meeting was a fiction"). The perceptual signature shows in details like "fingers tracing glyphs in the air as if they were solid things." Slight deduction for occasional elevated diction that edges toward purple ("velvety night").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The sugar was produced, but so was a pot of tea"). Some figurative density in places ("twilight bled into a velvety night") without clear payoff. The final paragraph achieves excellent propulsion as every element reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of learning a dead architectural language through a ghostly tutor offers fresh synthesis. The "agreed upon lies" between student and teacher provides non-obvious emotional complexity. The transformation from borrowing sugar to mystical communion feels earned through specific details rather than relying on genre tropes.</comment>
