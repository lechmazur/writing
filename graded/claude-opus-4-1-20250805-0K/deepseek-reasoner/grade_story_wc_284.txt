<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between seeking unused courage while fearing its exhaustion drives authentic tension, and her final choice to stand ground rather than flee shows earned transformation with visible cost. The young operative's presence creates immediate relational pressure that forces stance crystallization. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in processing the commander's revelation too quickly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from "burned spy" to "weapon reforged" with the phoenix symbolism charging the closure. The causal chain from mission→discovery→revelation→confrontation→choice holds firmly. Cost is visible in her raised empty hands and the risk of trusting again. Slight deduction for the commander's message feeling slightly convenient in its timing and preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded bluff and layered snowdrifts constrain Elara's search method and create physical danger on the unstable cornice. The engraved pillbox serves as micro-setting that enables the final confrontation's resolution. Setting pressure is consistent but could more actively shape middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds causally from solitary search→discovery→revelation→confrontation with another operative, each narrowing Elara's options. The final choice between violence/flight/trust carries clear cost in vulnerability. The stake of restoring honor through renewed trust is well-signaled and tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The phoenix motif transforms from symbol of betrayal to restoration, reweighting Elara's entire understanding without explicit moralizing. Theme of trust's fragility and reconstruction emerges through concrete action. The final image of "weapon reforged" resonates with the "fix what's broken" concept through earned specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara reads the snow codes and notices tactical details like the operative's hand near his sidearm. Voice maintains consistent control through escalating pressure. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("I am Elara...We have work to do"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in some descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the mist clung to the pines like a shroud"). Some metaphor density in opening that doesn't fully pay off ("map of old pain"). Minor template cadence in middle search sequence. Information density is good but has occasional redundancy ("cold, wet rock" where context implies both).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "codes in accumulated snow" concept offers fresh specificity for dead drop mechanics. The reversal that the betrayer was actually protector transforms the burned spy trope meaningfully. Risk-taking in the quiet, restrained ending pays off thematically.</comment>
