<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization with Kael's backward walking as physical manifestation of anxiety and Elara's "combative tenderness" creating genuine tension. The transformation from ghost-like untethering to solidification is earned through concrete choice ("You chose the door"), though the resolution's speed slightly undercuts the cost of change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Kael's solidification represents reversal of exile through annotating memory. Cost is visible in confronting the painful memory and choosing "the harder, truer thing." The shard-mirror system and tea-leaf geometry create coherent world logic that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive of glass shards creates atmospheric pressure, with "high, grimy windows" and "silent aisles" establishing isolation. The tea leaves' "fluid geometry" and shadow's "dark arrow" provide specific visual anchors that constrain the solution method, though the external world remains slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Kael's arrival as "flickering afterimage" through confronting the fracture point to final solidification. The dominant stake—reversing soul exile—tightens when Elara identifies the exact moment of concession through tea-leaf geometry, forcing Kael to face "the choice point" with visible cost in his flinching retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "reversible exile" and choosing resilience over retreat, crystallizing in "the road not taken." The final image of the empty swing as "quiet witness to a quiet victory" resonates without moralizing, though the resolution's tidiness slightly diminishes complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("whetstone on soft metal") and clean dialogue carrying subtext. POV remains stable with Elara's clinical precision contrasting Kael's uncertainty, though some phrases like "combative tenderness" and "fractured ghosts" edge toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some metaphorical density in places ("keeper of exiles," "fractured ghosts") and occasional abstraction ("poignant stillness") create minor drag, but the tea-leaf analysis sequence maintains strong momentum through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archive as repository of exiled souls offers fresh conceptual territory, with tea-leaf geometry as divination method adding specificity. The backward-walking manifestation of anxiety provides original embodiment, though the resolution mechanism feels slightly mechanical despite strong premise.</comment>
