<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between isolation and the pull toward action creates genuine tension, particularly in her shift from mapping dust motes to following paper trails. The final choice to walk to the post office herself, making eye contact with the clerk, represents earned change from her betrayal-driven isolation with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from the meteorite's arrival through investigation to final action, with Elara's decision to trust again forming a decisive change with emotional cost. However, the geologist's backstory and corporate conspiracy feel slightly underdeveloped for the weight they carry in motivating the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attic setting functions as more than backdrop—dust motes under skylight become a meditation practice, old ledgers provide investigation tools, and the narrow stairs mark her re-entry into the world. The Martian meteorite's "cold and impossibly heavy" presence effectively bridges terrestrial and cosmic scales.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal isolation through investigation to the final act of trust, with the meteorite's weight serving as constant pressure. The transformation of "paper trails" from something Elara creates to obscure into something she follows to reveal provides meaningful tightening, though the corporate threat remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of trust versus isolation emerges organically through concrete actions—from handling pigeons to following trails to personal delivery. The final image of charting "a different course, not away from the world, but back into its messy, dangerous, and beautiful heart" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening's careful avoidance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with selective perception ("meticulous balance," "weight of a message") that reflects Elara's precision-oriented worldview. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative observation to urgent investigation, though some passages lean toward elevated diction ("terrible, nascent trust") that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a digital scream into the void"), but occasional overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("painful and blooming withering process"). Some template phrasing emerges in transition moments, though the closing image lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeon trainer with Mars meteorite investigation creates an unexpected juxtaposition that feels earned through the paper trails connection. The transformation of Elara's self-protective skills into investigative tools shows genuine ingenuity, though the corporate conspiracy element trends toward familiar territory.</comment>
