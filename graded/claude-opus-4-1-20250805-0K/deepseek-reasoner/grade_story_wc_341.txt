<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to prove "empty spaces remember" drives authentic choices under pressure, with her calm cataloging after the break showing contradictory impulses (panic vs. scientific purpose). The shift from terror to acceptance feels earned through concrete action, though the final emotional state could embody more visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through emotional cloud cataloging toward Aris's Conceptual Repricing that "empty spaces remember." The beacon's arrival creates Charged Poise where rescue becomes irrelevant against her completed thesis, with cost visible in her acknowledgment of loss from the crew.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gondola functions as micro-setting constraining choice, while sensory details like "dusty starlight" and "black velvet canvas" create atmosphere. Cloud emotions viewed through the telescope effectively merge setting with theme, though some descriptions lean toward the generic ("profound peace").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survival to proving her life's work under extreme conditions, with the tether break forcing immediate choice. The accumulative pressure of cataloging emotions while drifting creates coherent tension, culminating in her acceptance that she's been "gathered up" by the sky with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Aris's work—the sky as emotional ledger becomes literal as she records its moods while becoming part of the record herself. The final "Remembered" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire drift as purposeful documentation rather than tragedy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Aris seeing emotions in meteorological phenomena maintains consistency. Voice modulates effectively from initial panic to scientific calm to final acceptance, though some phrases like "quietly explosive" and "spooled wholeness" feel artificially elevated for the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though phrases like "quietly explosive" and "profound peace" edge toward overwriting. Some paraphrase loops appear ("She had done it"/"She had proven her thesis"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("she felt a warmth spreading").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of categorizing clouds by emotion offers fresh angle on meteorology, with the broken tether forcing an extreme field test. The transformation from tragedy to triumph through scientific observation feels specific to this character, though the emotional cloud taxonomy could push further into unexpected territory.</comment>
