<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation builds causally from purposelessness to creative determination, with internal contradiction between accepting death and demanding more. The transformation from granting wishes to creating eternal echoes shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("profound ending," "raw materials") in early interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the amber bottle transforms from "useless anomaly" to catalyst for collective memory. Cost is legible in Elara's acceptance of living among echoes rather than real people. The "working memory" process and ritual preparation create causal linkage to the final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber bottle's physical properties (warm, pulsing, sealed) constrain Elara's solution and the crystalline arrays/copper wire create specific ritual requirements. Paper lanterns shift from wish containers to projection sources. Spatial choreography from workshop to town center is clear, though some setting details remain functional rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal purposelessness through deliberate cognitive reconstruction to town-wide transformation. The cost is clear: Elara trades potential human connection for eternal solitude among echoes. One meaningful deepening occurs as she shifts from seeking comfort to building a monument to it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of memory from recollection to reconstruction, with the amber bottle embodying potential despite apparent uselessness. The ending reweights "comfort" from false consolation to something built from loss. The resonant echoes offer a non-literal answer about permanence versus authentic life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and purposeful diction ("spectral glow," "suffocating silence"). Some register elevation in places ("profound ending," "metaphysical theorem") slightly exceeds the POV's established range. The perceptual signature of an alchemist seeing through formulas and reactions is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("profound ending," "raw materials," "false comfort" appears twice) and some elevated diction that occasionally obscures immediacy. The ending image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The amber bottle as unopenable catalyst offers fresh specificity, and using memory as literal reconstruction material shows originality. The solution feels earned through Elara's alchemical expertise. The concept of granting permanence to wishes through echo-forms rather than fulfillment transforms the ghost town trope meaningfully.</comment>
