<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's compulsive truthfulness creates genuine internal tension ("the words tasting like ash"), and her motivation to preserve wonder drives the decisive reveal. The character arc from anxious keeper to someone who acknowledges "I just kept the wonder" shows earned change with visible cost—her private secret exposed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: blackout removes script → truthfulness compulsion → riddle reveal → problem solved. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the restoration of routine coexists with preserved magic, showing felt cost in Elara's vulnerability. The orientation anchors (toll keeper, lightning tower, post-blackout) establish clearly by ~80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choices effectively—the lightning array's misalignment creates the crisis and its realignment enables resolution. Sensory details like "stone vibration" and "nectar dusk sky" are selective and support atmosphere. The matchbox as micro-setting object charges the final image when returned with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from city starvation threat to personal vulnerability when Elara must expose her secret. The pressure tightens through her compulsion forcing the reveal ("I might have something"), with visible cost in her trembling hands and confession. Resolution emerges from protagonist agency despite the truthfulness constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding "magic in the machine" emerges through action rather than statement, with the riddle literally solving the mechanical problem. The final line "The routine was restored, but the magic remained" offers resonant closure without moralizing, reweighting the opening's wonder-in-routine concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with selective perception ("familiar, anxious pull"). The truthfulness compulsion creates natural voice modulation under pressure. Some filter verbs ("Elara felt," "watched") could be stronger, but dialogue carries authentic subtext and advances plot effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some passive constructions ("was sent," "was complete") weaken momentum. Minor paraphrase loop with "preserved a piece of wonder"/"kept the wonder" in closing. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The truthfulness compulsion offers a fresh angle on the reluctant hero trope, forcing disclosure rather than enabling deception. The synthesis of magical riddle solving technical crisis feels earned through specific details. The matchbox-within-lacquer-box reveal subverts expectations effectively.</comment>
