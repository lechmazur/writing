<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find "the place where stories live" drives genuine transformation through embodied discovery. The jolt "not electric but deeply geometric" and her fingers tracing impossible curves show internal conflict acting in scene. However, the resolution lacks visible personal cost—she gains transcendent knowledge but sacrifices nothing concrete, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through hyperbolic expansion leading to the nexus discovery. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's role transforms from guardian to "custodian of the gateway." Cost is conceptual—the weight of infinite knowledge in "observed solitude"—though more concrete sacrifice would strengthen it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library's transformation into "a physical manifestation of a hyperbolic plane" constrains Elara's journey and charges the final image. Sensory details like the scarf feeling "like a whisper against her skin" and stories as "essences—tragedies cold and sharp" create vivid specificity that shapes the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scarf triggers escalation from normal library to hyperbolic space to narrative nexus, with stakes deepening through geometric transformation. However, the student's interruption deflates tension without consequence, and Elara's transformation lacks concrete trade-offs—she gains cosmic awareness without losing anything tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of "infinity held in a finite room" and the library as "a poem written in the language of space and story." The ending reweights prior material—her eccentric book-talking becomes "a perfectly logical response to the beautiful truth she kept." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "nexus of pure narrative."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sanely eccentric" and the selective noticing of mathematical poetry. Voice modulates effectively during the transformation sequence. However, some register drift occurs in abstract passages ("a concept...a nexus of pure narrative") that momentarily abandons Elara's grounded perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"equations of celestial mechanics were shelved beside verses of longing" establishes setting, theme, and tone simultaneously. Some abstract drift in the nexus description ("essences—tragedies cold and sharp") and minor redundancy in the ending's explanation of her changed state reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-hyperbolic-space accessed through mathematical poetry is genuinely fresh. The transformation of a mundane lost scarf into a geometric key shows creative risk-taking. The concept of stories existing in negative curvature space offers a non-obvious angle that feels inevitable once revealed.</comment>
