<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (failed origami, lantern-making), with contradictory impulses of sorrow and creative purpose acting simultaneously. The transformation from grief to luminous release is earned through specific labor, though the brother remains more concept than person. Internal states manifest physically ("fingers stained with pigment," working through pain), avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through craft details, the island's orbital dance, and the transformation sequence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief literally transforms into light. Cost is visible in "luminous torment" and the release of the last memory. The ascending/descending motif mirrors internal state and pays off in the final "descend while ascending" as weight leaves while heart rises.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating island setting with its "orbital ascent" and "conflicting gravitational dance" constrains and mirrors Elara's emotional state, directly shaping the final release. Sensory detail is selective ("ozone and jasmine," "silver-leafed bushes"), filtered through a craftsperson's attention to light and material. The glass basilica functions as both setting element and crafted object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief—tightens through the crafting process, with the island's descent-while-ascending creating external pressure that mirrors internal conflict. The final release carries visible cost: she must let go of her last memory to create something new. Agency manifests through creative transformation rather than confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of memory into monument without stating morals. The light crane as "luminous torment, so beautiful it ached" offers a non-literal answer about grief becoming art. The recurring ascent/descent paradox charges the final image where release and rise coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a craftsperson's selective perception ("subtle geometries of light," "method of its polishing"), though occasional elevation strains ("luminous torment" appears twice). The perceptual signature focuses on light, materials, and technical process consistently. Some filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") could strengthen with direct perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though "luminous torment" repetition and some elevated diction ("perpetual cloud layer," "conflicting gravitational dance") occasionally strain the register. Information unfolds cleanly through action. The transformation sequence maintains clarity despite complexity. Minor scaffold in "She knew what she had to do."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-craft with the floating island's physical paradox creates a fresh angle on loss. The dream-memory becoming a light-crane through glass architecture is specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the surreal setting and transformation sequence heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
