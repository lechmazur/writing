<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>K's motivation evolves credibly from seeking "texture of memories" to pursuing justice, with the poison label creating genuine internal conflict. The character's method of layering stories onto containers shows consistent traits, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("cold stone in K's chest"). The final choice to deliver evidence anonymously demonstrates clear values hierarchy with visible cost—surrendering potential recognition for truth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered stories culminating in the poison discovery that reweights everything. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as K transforms from passive collector to active justice-seeker, with clear cost in remaining nameless. The piece teaches its pattern early (collecting/layering fragments) and pays it off when K assembles the poison narrative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth functions as both physical maze and metaphorical archive, with tides creating temporal pressure. Sensory details like "smelling of salt and neglect" and "groaning as if breathing" are selective and purposeful. The containers constrain K's investigation to tidal windows, though the newspaper office arrival feels slightly generic compared to the vivid port setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The poison label discovery creates a clear escalation from passive collecting to active investigation, narrowing K's options from infinite stories to one demanding justice. Tidal cycles provide natural pressure points, and K's agency drives the resolution through deliberate evidence compilation. The cost is legible—K remains erased while resurrecting another's truth—though the middle investigation section could show more granular pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between K's bureaucratic erasure and the poison victim's deliberate silencing. The final image of stories that "once unearthed, could never be drowned again" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the tidal imagery. K finding purpose through giving voice to another erased soul creates genuine complexity about identity and justice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—K sees "phantom outlines" and filters reality through collected narratives. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("palimpsest of erased histories") that slightly exceeds K's established lexicon. The voice modulates effectively with discovery, shifting from meditative to urgent without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm shifts. However, several instances of elevated diction ("grim pronouncement," "meticulous and patient") and abstract phrasing ("texture of memories") dull immediacy. The metaphor "cold stone in K's chest" is stock, and some passages lean toward telling over showing, particularly in the investigation summary paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a bureaucratically dead person archiving forgotten stories offers a fresh angle on identity erasure. The poison label discovery transforms from potential cliché through specific integration with K's collecting method. While the investigation follows familiar beats, the parallel between administrative and criminal erasure creates meaningful resonance.</comment>
