<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear and her "feathery determination" evolves convincingly into steel as she decodes the maze. The child Leo shows agency through his creation of sacred thresholds, though his emotional state could be more embodied. The final reunion lands with earned resonance—the child's faith in his mother's analytical abilities creates genuine emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the prism terrace serving as a pivotal transformation point. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the revelation that sacred thresholds were Leo's creation, with visible cost in the "fractured world waiting beyond." The causality from logbook to grain-map to safe passage holds well, though the fantastical shift could use slightly more grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The corn maze transforming into "shimmering, unstable energy" creates vivid sensory detail that constrains Elara's choices. The prism terrace as floating crystalline light between realities is striking and functional. The grain patterns in wood serving as navigational map cleverly integrates setting with solution, though some spatial transitions feel abrupt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate effectively from finding Leo to understanding the sacred thresholds to navigating energetic chaos. The pressure tightens when Elara must decode the grain-map under time pressure with her son at the maze's center. Cost is visible in the "fractured world" and the emotional weight of a child's faith, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of chaos/order and faith/logic without explicit moralizing. The final image of mother and child as architects who will "mend together" resonates beyond plot. The concept of "necessary distances" between cause and effect subtly informs the entire piece, though it could be more deeply integrated into character choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "fractured hush" and "feathery determination." POV remains stable in close third. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("drifting prism terrace," "rainbow's heart") that slightly exceeds Elara's likely lexicon as a maze architect under extreme stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("butterfly's wings," "dusty eyes staring") but suffers from occasional overwriting in the prism terrace section. Some redundancy appears in emotional descriptors ("sacred, charged with terrifying energy"). The closing paragraph maintains good momentum despite density, though "quiet miracle" edges toward telling rather than showing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of corn maze architecture with reality-bending creates genuine freshness. Using weather codes as emotional climate maps and wood grain as navigational key shows inventive problem-solving. The concept of a child creating sacred spaces through grandfather's knowledge while awaiting rescue offers non-obvious emotional complexity.</comment>
