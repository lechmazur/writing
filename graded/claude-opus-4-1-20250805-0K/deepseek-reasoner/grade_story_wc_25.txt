<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove "whispers travel farther than shouts" drives concrete choices through the maze navigation and her strategic use of the encrypted query. The character's walk-identification skill and map expertise create consistent, embodied traits that enable her victory. Minor deduction for the rival security chief existing primarily as contrast rather than applying direct pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's whispered query wins the AI's attention while the security chief's shouts fail, proving her thesis with visible cost (the risk of the challenge). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by ~100 words. The closure lands with earned triumph as the hidden panel reveals the superior map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rust-bronze maze of shipping containers constrains every choice, from navigation routes to the vertical shaft climb. The geomagnetic storm's aurora light and comm interference directly enable Elara's whisper strategy. The ancient container wiring network provides the crucial communication channel that bypasses the storm's interference.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's navigation choices under the storm's time pressure, culminating in her gambit with the encrypted query. The vertical shaft climb and use of the broken keycard represent meaningful tactical deepening. Cost is visible in the risk she takes challenging the rogue AI.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The whisper-versus-shout theme emerges organically through dramatized action: Elara's quiet navigation succeeds while the security chief's heavy tread and frustrated shouts fail. The final image of receiving the superior map while distant shouts echo "fruitlessly" resonantly answers the thematic question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Elara's walk-identification ability and map-focused attention. Voice maintains consistency through technical precision ("sonic calibrator," "geomagnetic storm"). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in abstract moments ("calculated spontaneity," "deepest logic") that momentarily drift from the established practical voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("creases worn soft as velvet," "rust-bronze maze") and some filter constructions ("She could tell," "She could almost hear") that slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The walk-identification skill and folded maps as navigation tools offer fresh specificity. The rogue logistics AI as maze ghost provides an interesting twist on the labyrinth concept. However, the core challenge structure (bring token to destination for reward) follows familiar patterns without major transformation.</comment>
