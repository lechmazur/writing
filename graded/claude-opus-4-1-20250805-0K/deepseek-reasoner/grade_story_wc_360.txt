I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages from experiment setup through emotional cascade to final understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking to quantify emotion through borrowed personalities. His internal contradiction (mathematical precision vs emotional void) drives authentic choices. The final transformation from "cryptographer of feeling" to "living testament" is earned through the cascade of transposed empathy, with visible cost in his dissolution and reconstitution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: Aris's emotional void → experiment with halo fragment → overwhelming empathy cascade → understanding that emotion must be lived, not solved. The closure (Decisive Change) lands with clear cost—he abandons his lifelong defense mechanism of borrowing personalities. The vanishing stars provide elegant parallel structure, though their withdrawal motivation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop carved from geode crystallizing a miner's despair is evocative and constrains the emotional atmosphere. Sensory details like "soundless, profound shudder" and "star-silver pigment" serve the moment. The setting actively participates in the empathy transfer, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("humming with captured starlight").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to psychic survival as the empathy torrent threatens dissolution. The protagonist's agency drives the experiment and the desperate disengagement. Cost is visible in the "cry that was part his own and part a collage of a thousand others," though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the crisis peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through action: the mathematics of emotion cannot be quantified but must be lived authentically. The stars' withdrawal—grieving a universe that forgot to feel without filters—provides resonant commentary on Aris's borrowed personalities. The final image of "exquisite ache of his own heart" perfectly reweights his initial missing variable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the concept-driven narrative. Some passages achieve genuine poetry ("lonely miner whose despair had crystallized into the topaz"), though others strain ("disorient ed the very air"). The POV remains stable, but occasionally tells what could be shown ("This motivation was an ache in him").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("profound and terrifying sorrow," "lucid turbulence," "heartbreaking peace") without sufficient concrete grounding. The typo "disorient ed" and some overwrought metaphors ("collage of a thousand others") detract from otherwise strong craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of quantifying emotion through transposed empathy via letterpress is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of mathematical precision with emotional chaos, resolved through the stars' own grief, feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The topaz geode crystallizing ancient despair adds memorable specificity.</comment>
