I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arden's yearning for freedom and suffocation in enforced peace creates clear motivation that drives the entire arc. His transformation into the whale shows earned change through prior causality with visible cost (releasing his entire identity). The internal contradiction between his graceful efficiency and wild yearning nature operates throughout, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("wild and yearning thing") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification (whale song, island manifestation, transformation) leading to a Decisive Change with visible cost. The transformation from human to whale lands on-page with Arden releasing "his name, his history, his quiet anger" before being absorbed. Orientation anchors effectively by ~120 words, and the mystical premise pays off through consistent world-building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe setting constrains choice effectively (where Arden finds the scrimshaw), and the disappearing island's physical details (black cliffs, whispering pines, crystalline heart) create atmospheric pressure. The black sand beach and shifting rock passages provide tactile grounding. Setting could more actively shape middle tactics beyond discovery and arrival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal suffocation through discovery, theft, journey, to the final choice of complete detachment. The whale's increasingly urgent song creates mounting pressure that forces Arden's stance crystallization. The cost is legible: to belong, he must surrender everything he's known, enacted through the final transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of freedom through belonging emerges organically from Arden's journey without explicit moralizing. The final transformation reweights the opening's "prisoner in a cage without bars" - he finds freedom not through escape but through fundamental change. The whale imagery accumulates meaning from carved map to living song to final becoming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and selective perception (Arden notices the scrimshaw among "worthless trinkets"). Prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the transformation sequence. Some phrases drift toward elevated register ("profound song resonated") that slightly exceeds the dock worker's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm, particularly in the climactic transformation. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision ("wild and yearning thing," "resigned acceptance") and some metaphors strain ("prisoner in a cage without bars"). The final paragraph's syntax effectively mirrors the transformation's fluidity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a disappearing island that manifests only for kindred souls offers fresh inflection on the journey-to-belonging template. The specific synthesis of enforced peace, whale-song navigation, and transformation into marine life creates non-obvious resonance. The ending's metamorphosis feels earned through accumulated particulars rather than convenient magic.</comment>
