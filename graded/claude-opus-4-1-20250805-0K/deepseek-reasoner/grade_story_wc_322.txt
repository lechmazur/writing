<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her internal shift from rigid rationality to accepting irrationality is earned through the failed weaving. The moment of awe rather than fear when her pattern erupts shows genuine character complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of connection" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's worldview shifts from "rational enchantment" to accepting "ungovernable experience," with clear cost in her shattered equipment and failed commission. The causal chain from confident weaving to forced connections to eruption to revelation is clean. The shift from "weave" to "listen" crystallizes the change with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery functions as more than backdrop—its warping walls and rippling floors mirror and amplify the psychic eruption. Vivid sensory detail in "sinew thread glowed faintly" and "streaks of panic and shards of anger." The gallery's return to "dormant, deceptive stillness" effectively brackets the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear escalation from controlled weaving to aggressive forcing when the memory resists, culminating in the pattern's violent eruption. The cost is visible in the destroyed loom and dead thread. The veteran's "locked box within a locked box" creates genuine resistance that drives Elara's increasing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the contrast between "rational enchantment" and "ungovernable experience," with the eruption serving as both plot climax and thematic revelation. The final shift from weaving to listening embodies the theme without stating it. The "texture of connection" being "jagged, unpredictable, and powerful" resonates beyond the immediate story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "fever dream architect" and "realistically imaginary." Some register elevation in "mnemonic reagents" and "mandala of experience" that slightly strains the established voice. The shift from clinical observation to awe is well-modulated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("texture of connection," "principle of rational enchantment") that could be more concrete. Some overwriting in the eruption sequence with mixed metaphors ("silent psychic detonation," "streaks of panic and shards of anger"). Information density is high and momentum maintains through the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-weaving and therapeutic dreamwork with the specific detail of bio-luminescent moth sinew. The concept of forced logical patterns causing psychic eruption when applied to trauma is original. The transformation from architect to listener offers a non-obvious resolution that feels earned.</comment>
