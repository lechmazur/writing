<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's transformation from cold inspector to someone capable of connection is earned through the conch shell's revelations about the builders' regrets. His final act of crowning Elara shows genuine change with visible emotional cost ("a single tear traced a path"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("calcified his soul") but the contradictory impulses between professional duty and emerging humanity play out convincingly in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas shifts from certifying isolation to dissolving emotional walls, crystallized in the crowning gesture. The cost is felt through the builders' confessed regrets and Silas's "trembling hand." Causal lens holds throughout with the pearl/conch mechanism driving the transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat abrupt final insight, though it's prepared by prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal caves' "latent radiance" and "profound, dead silence" effectively mirror and pressure Silas's internal state. The pearl and conch shell constrain his final choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("vast, empty galleries") but the amethyst/quartz dome and the niche's specific placement ground the climactic scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical inspection to confronting the emotional cost of isolation, tightening through the conch's revelations that force Silas to reconsider his entire purpose. The pearl's crowning represents a clear foreclosure of his old path with visible cost. Minor deduction as the middle section could apply more pressure before the conch moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bunker-as-monument-to-abandoned-hope revelation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The pearl as "physical manifestation of collective sorrow" and the final connection that shines "brighter than any crystal" create resonant, non-literal answers about isolation versus connection. The ending reweights all prior inspection details as symptoms of emotional walls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Silas's professional precision giving way to emotional uncertainty. Voice modulates effectively from clinical ("noted flaws with cold efficiency") to vulnerable ("his hand trembling"). Elara's minimal dialogue carries strong subtext. Minor deduction for some elevated diction ("calcified," "arbiter") that occasionally drifts from Silas's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("profound, dead silence," "resonant hush that amplified"). Information density is high in key beats. The conch sequence effectively varies rhythm. Deductions for abstract phrases ("vocation that had calcified his soul") and occasional redundancy ("soft, eternal light that felt both beautiful and terribly lonely").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle on bunker fiction by focusing on the inspector's emotional architecture rather than apocalypse. The pearl-as-crown transformation and the builders' confessions of missed life rather than feared death show genuine originality. The specific synthesis of inspection profession with emotional walls feels earned, not forced.</comment>
