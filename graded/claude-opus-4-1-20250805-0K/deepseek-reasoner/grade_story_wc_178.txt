I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is a Causal story - the astronomer's calculations directly cause the tablet's activation, which leads to his understanding and acceptance of guardianship. Clear because/therefore linkages throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kalanu's motivation is clear and builds through embodied reactions ("frugal nature screaming," "thrill that was empirically ironic"). The shift from seeking power to accepting guardianship feels earned through his confrontation with the priestess. Minor deduction for the priestess's somewhat stock mystical opposition role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Kalanu accepts guardianship rather than gaining power, with visible cost (his charts burning, burden accepted). The revelation that "to seal the covenant was to become its warden" reweights the entire quest. Orientation anchors established early and maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The palace setting with "dusky harmony of long shadows and fading ochre light" creates atmosphere while the magic square tile constrains choices and drives the climax. Setting details like the bas-relief and massive pillar serve the action. Could push higher with more tactile environmental pressure during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual pursuit to spiritual confrontation when the priestess appears, forcing Kalanu to use calculation against incantation. The burning of his charts creates immediate cost. The final revelation that he becomes warden rather than master effectively tightens options with clear price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the irony of using logic to approach mystical power - "employing logic to validate miracle." The ending reweights devotion from submission to guardianship without stating a moral. The contrast between empirical and mystical knowledge creates productive ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent scholarly POV with distinct diction ("frugal astronomer," "empirically ironic"). The priestess's dialogue carries appropriate mystical register. Some filter phrases ("Kalanu felt," "he understood") could be more immediate, though they fit the analytical character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("dusky harmony," "cavernous husk") and there's mild repetition of "covenant" and "devotion." The mathematical precision language effectively mirrors character perspective.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical logic versus mystical power, with the twist that calculation becomes another form of devotion. The concept of becoming warden rather than master offers a non-obvious resolution. The specific Babylonian setting and magic square mathematics ground the fantastical elements.</comment>
