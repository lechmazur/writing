I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation (mathematical sequences, eel movements) toward a resonant reconfiguration where friction returns through alignment rather than control.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is rooted in his precognitive curse and the promise he cannot remember but feels weighted by. His internal contradiction between controlling and aligning with the eels drives the closure choice effectively. The embodied details of arranging stones and feeling the eels' movement create specificity, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("the entirety of his being").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - Kaelen's realization that "to harness was not to control, but to align" reweights the entire premise with visible cost (the promise was his vow to a dying world). The accumulative structure coheres as mathematical patterns draw the eels, who trace the solution, leading to friction's return. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frictionless world and perpetual borrowed dawn create atmospheric pressure that shapes Kaelen's work. The aurora functions as both light source and power source for the painted symbols. The tidal bluffs and sod hut ground the action spatially, though more tactile detail of the frictionless world's specific constraints would strengthen the setting's role in choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the mathematical sequence completion, the eels' emergence, and the appearance of the star dust - each tightening toward the moment of alignment. The cost is legible when Kaelen must become "part of the pattern" rather than its controller. Agency drives the resolution through his conscious shift from herding to aligning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the control/alignment dichotomy without explicit moralizing. The eels as guides rather than charges reweights the herding concept meaningfully. The final image of "first real dawn" breaking within Kaelen resonates as earned wisdom from concrete experience, though the "borrowed dawn" metaphor could be more precisely developed throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone. The perceptual signature shows in details like "sleek, dark bodies" and "smooth, sea-worn stones." Some passages drift toward abstraction ("the entirety of his being"), and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy ("He understood now").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("a shimmering, silent river of green and violet") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("a plea, a question, and a scaffold all at once"). Several template constructions appear ("He was placing," "He finished," "He understood"). Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely assert.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frictionless world premise offers genuine freshness, and the mathematical eel patterns create an unexpected synthesis. The transformation from herder to aligned participant provides a non-obvious resolution. However, some elements feel convenient (the star dust appearing exactly when summoned) rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
