<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's "logically emotional" motivation creates genuine internal tension, particularly when she must choose between physical confrontation and intellectual adaptation. The fear-freeze moment ("Panic, cold and sharp, threatened to freeze her in place") embodies stress convincingly, though some interior passages lean toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal drive: threat arrives → protagonist adapts through technical mastery → closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with the lighthouse's "adaptive song" as permanent protection. The cost is legible in the transformation from keeper to "part of the song," though the sonic absolution solution arrives somewhat conveniently from grandfather's journals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina creates genuine constraint—the grinding ice threatens the harbor, the lighthouse location determines tactical options, and the crystalline rings become essential tools. Sensory hierarchy works well (engineer notices frequencies, mechanical details), though some descriptions ("monochrome world of grays and whites") tend generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from polite requests to aggressive extraction attempt, with the artifact's pitch change ("A-minor wavered, pitching upward") marking genuine threat. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through technical skill rather than force, though the antagonists' sudden neutralization feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between destructive extraction and harmonious protection, with sonic absolution as non-violent resistance. The final image of Elara becoming "part of the song" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the corporate villains remain somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Technical vocabulary and engineering perspective create distinct voice ("calculating harmonic offsets and resonant frequencies"), with controlled psychic distance during the tuning sequence. Some passages drift toward explanatory register ("Its resonant frequency kept the aggressive, grinding ice at bay"), breaking the immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm during the climactic tuning sequence. However, several redundancies appear ("cold and sharp" panic, "brutal C-sharp, a note of conquest and fracture" over-explains), and some metaphors strain ("fleshly ethereal effort").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The sonic defense system offers a fresh angle on the lighthouse-keeper tradition, and vibrational matching as conflict resolution shows originality. However, the evil corporation threatening sacred artifact follows familiar templates without significant transformation.</comment>
