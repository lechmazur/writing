<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's socially perceptive nature manifests through her reading of the sand patterns as "worried lines on a friend's face" and her non-verbal intervention through the mandala rather than words, showing embodied understanding. The transformation from chalk artist seeking meaning to one who discovers it through silence and connection is earned through her meditative sand work. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of the strangers' conflict, though their anger dissolving into understanding through the mandala's patterns shows adequate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mandala's construction building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tile's note transforms conflict into understanding. The closure lands with conceptual cost as the Unlearning shifts from "ending" to "first line of a new drawing," showing meaningful reweighting. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly (Elara, Whispering Grotto, during the Unlearning). The transformation of the arguing strangers through pattern recognition creates legitimate before/after change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively shapes the story through its whispering tiles, emergent hush pooling at center, and the sand that enables the mandala's creation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist," "damp stone," "lilac unease," "hiss of sand"). The setting constrains choice by driving Elara from sun-drenched pavement to this specific space where the mandala can emerge. Minor deduction for some abstract atmospheric description ("woven from lilac unease") that doesn't fully ground physicality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding "meaning in the mess" escalates through the mandala's construction, the emergent hush deepening, and culminates when the arguing strangers' conflict threatens to "ignite the lingering lilac unease into something darker." Elara's agency manifests through her artistic intervention—tapping the tile to release the pure note that transforms conflict. The cost is visible as the strangers abandon their defensive postures to see connection rather than rubble.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mandala's geometry revealing that "meaning wasn't found in a single, perfect truth, but in the relationships between broken pieces." The Unlearning concept evolves from dissolution to transformation without explicit moralizing. The final image of the Unlearning as "the first line of a new drawing" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to finding meaning in chaos. Subtext operates through the mandala's patterns speaking what words cannot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("moved through the mist...fingers stained with the ghosts of a hundred rainbows"). The perceptual signature shows an artist's eye reading emotional patterns in physical forms. Dialogue feels natural and oppositional ("You can't just build on rubble!"), advancing the conflict efficiently. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("emergent hush," "lilac unease") that slightly distances from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, with purposeful figurative language ("ghosts of a hundred rainbows," "sugar in rain"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures concrete action ("lilac unease...clung to the skin"), some elevated register drift ("palpable twilight"), and minor repetition of "emergent hush" concept without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chalk artist working with sand instead of her usual medium offers a fresh angle on artistic adaptation. The concept of the Unlearning as a time of dissolution transformed into creative beginning shows originality. The mandala as a map of emotional/social patterns rather than purely decorative art demonstrates specific innovation. The resolution through sound and silence rather than words or direct action takes a non-obvious path.</comment>
