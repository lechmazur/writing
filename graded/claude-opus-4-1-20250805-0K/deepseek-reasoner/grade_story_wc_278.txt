<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's guilt drives consistent, embodied choices through concrete details like the constellation tattooing and sound preservation. The internal contradiction between her public work (mapping others' grief) and private penance (preserving lost sounds) creates genuine tension. The final choice to imprison the ghost-cry in amber is earned through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak ("dissonance of old guilt").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the amber becomes a "data sink" that transforms from comfort object to prison to peace. The cyclical structure (Alistair's failure → corrupted code → Elara's inheritance → breaking the loop) lands with visible cost. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The "time folds in on itself" metaphor effectively frames the collapsed causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory atmosphere of "captured and catalogued absences" and "latent energy of a thousand archived silences" creates distinctive texture. The amber's physical warmth and internal light constrain the final choice effectively. However, the setting could pressure choices more actively—the lab functions mainly as backdrop rather than active constraint until the final sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (breaking the haunted firmware's loop) escalates through discovery of letters → understanding the source → active intervention. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as past guilt compounds into present haunting. The cost is legible when Elara must confront that she's "still living inside" the past. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amber's transformation from comfort to prison to peace, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of preserved loss—sounds as "catalogued absences"—resonates through concrete particulars. The final image of the insect "at peace" offers a non-literal answer about cycles of guilt without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("constellation tattooist," "meteor hush"). The perceptual signature remains consistent—Elara notices through sound/silence contrasts and technological metaphors. Some elevated diction ("latent energy," "spectrograms") fits the character's technical expertise, though occasionally risks register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story functions. However, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the dissonance of old guilt," "captured and catalogued absences") and occasional redundancy appears ("finally, properly, laid to rest"). The "time folds in on itself" paragraph risks opacity without fully earning its compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound preservation technology with emotional haunting offers a fresh angle on guilt and inheritance. The specific detail of firmware containing a ghost-cry from failed infant translation experiments transforms familiar grief narrative. The amber's evolution from comfort object to data sink shows genuine ingenuity, though some metaphorical elements feel slightly overworked.</comment>
