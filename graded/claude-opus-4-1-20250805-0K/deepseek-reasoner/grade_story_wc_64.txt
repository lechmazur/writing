<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling—discovering the shape of intentions drives every action. Her transformation from cemetery gardener to resurrectionist is earned through concrete discovery, not epiphany. The internal consistency holds as she moves from patient untangling to understanding, with visible cost in her isolation ("the last person who remembered the old world's rules had left her").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through tapestry decoding to the revelation of the cemetery as seed vault. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the entire world recontextualizes from memorial to promise, with clear cost (she's alone with this vast responsibility). The golden thread creates clean causality linking discovery to understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and cemetery setting constrain and enable choices effectively—the tapestry's physical border drives the untangling method, the hidden compartment emerges from the floor. Sensory details like "velveteen gloom" and "plush darkness" create consistent atmosphere. The setting transforms from place of ending to library of genetic memory, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from understanding the past to resurrection responsibility. The golden thread discovery tightens pressure by revealing the sovereign case, which requires further untangling to open. Cost is visible in Elara's isolation and the weight of becoming humanity's sole resurrectionist ("ready to begin").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of untangling to understand—literally with threads, conceptually with history's intentions. The reversal from death-garden to life-vault resonates without stating a moral. The final image of Elara holding the glowing knot "ready to begin" offers a non-literal answer about hope encoded in apparent endings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphoric density ("blithe cemetery gardener," "velveteen gloom"). Some elevated diction ("blithe," "sovereign") fits the fairy-tale tone but occasionally feels precious. The perceptual signature—seeing patterns in chaos, finding meaning in borders—is character-specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("neat rows between the headstones," "twin flags forever fallen," "plush darkness"). Some redundancy appears ("cool and still," "patient and sure"). The clarity remains intact but the ornamentation occasionally obscures momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a cemetery as genetic seed vault offers genuine freshness, transforming the death-garden trope. The tapestry's border holding the key rather than its center shows original thinking. However, some elements feel convenient (the golden thread appearing exactly when needed), preventing higher scoring.</comment>
