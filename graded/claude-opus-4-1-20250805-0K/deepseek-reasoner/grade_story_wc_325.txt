<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal pressure that compounds with external stakes, particularly in "the familiar panic of her claustrophobia clawing at her throat." Her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" drives the mission beyond mere retrieval. The final choice to use the untested phase transition protocol shows agency under extreme pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the Codex activation triggers facility destabilization, forcing the phase transition escape. Closure lands with Decisive Change as Elara physically transitions to safety while emotionally committing to continue the work. Cost is visible in the "violent, silent scream of energy" and her recognition that "her work had only just begun."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The facility as "skeletal structure of rusting metal and reinforced polymer grown over with pale, ghostly anemones" creates vivid specificity. The environment constrains choice through the collapsing entrance and enables escape via the tracking array. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from submersible to lab to surface buoy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: Codex retrieval → facility activation → structural collapse → forced phase transition. The tidal change creates genuine time pressure that forecloses the original exit route. Cost manifests in the terrifying transition experience and the weight of continuing to honor the dead scientists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the silenced emerges through action rather than statement. The Codex as both artifact and key creates resonance between retrieval and revelation. The ending reweights the mission from simple extraction to ongoing commitment, though the thematic complexity could deepen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent thriller-prose efficiency with selective heightening: "crashing hush" and "liquid weight" establish atmosphere. POV remains stable with appropriate knowledge limits. Prose accelerates during the escape sequence though could develop more distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with strong verb choices: "maneuvered," "seized," "blazed." Information density high throughout with minimal scaffold. Some minor repetition in emotional descriptors ("panic," "sharp") but momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The phase transition escape mechanism offers genuine freshness, integrating quantum physics with underwater thriller conventions. The transformation of a research facility from geological study to dimensional tracking adds conceptual depth. The specific detail of "margin illuminant gold fleck" as calibrator shows inventive world-building.</comment>
