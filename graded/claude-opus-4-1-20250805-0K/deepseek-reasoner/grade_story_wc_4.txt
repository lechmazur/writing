<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deepens from professional puzzle-solving to understanding collective healing. Her perceptively calm focus manifests in concrete actions (matching cufflink to watch face) and the final choice to leave her work to the community shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("warm, earnest whimsy filling her chest") rather than pure embodiment in the closure beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building from fragmented photographs to living lavender field, with the final sliver creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the entire project's meaning. The closure lands with clear conceptual cost—the factory's violence was always paired with its promise of restoration. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (protagonist's name appears late) though this serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lavender field functions as both literal setting and conceptual anchor, constraining Elara's final understanding and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (lavender scent "clinging to her clothes like a benevolent ghost"), with the contrast between rusted ruins and purple field driving the thematic revelation. The setting evolution from studio to ruins to field creates coherent spatial progression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (transmuting industrial pain into understanding) escalates through the puzzle's resistance, the journey to the ruins, and crystallizes when the lavender tip reveals the founders' foresight. The conflict between decay and persistence generates authentic tension, with the final community gathering showing visible cost paid through generations of tending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery of the lavender tip in the photograph, avoiding abstract moralizing. The concept of collective healing develops through specific images (factory/field contrast) and the multi-generational tending becomes the living answer to industrial damage. The final image of Elara walking through lavender with the scent clinging offers resonant closure without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception fitting an archivist ("fragments of a single, shattered moment"). Some filter verb accumulation ("she felt," "she saw") slightly dulls immediacy in middle sections. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, and the psychic distance modulates appropriately from close focus during puzzle work to wider perspective at the community gathering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("violent past and this peacefully persistent present"). Minor paraphrase loops appear ("The masterpiece wasn't the factory. It was the healing" followed by explanatory restatement). Information density is mostly strong, with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional redundancies prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of reassembling historical photographs to discover a promise of restoration offers a fresh angle on industrial ruin narratives. The specific synthesis of archival work with environmental healing feels earned, though the resolution tends toward the safely redemptive. The lavender field as both literal and metaphorical answer shows thoughtful execution of the collective healing concept.</comment>
