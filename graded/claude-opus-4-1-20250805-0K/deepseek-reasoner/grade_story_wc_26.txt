<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—comparing dream-logs reveals the erosion of individual hope into collective complacency, and her final choice to create rather than borrow costs her "profound exertion that was mental and spiritual." The internal contradiction between preserving hope and witnessing its dissolution drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the shadow's nature remaining somewhat abstract until the final transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow's return and the stone's transformation crystallize Elara's ability to reverse collective complacency, with visible cost in her "peculiar draining." The piece teaches its pattern early (dream-sharing's consequences) and pays it off through the shadow's manifestation. Orientation anchors land cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Blooming Library's "crystalline spires" and "flowering vines that pulsed with soft, internal light" create vivid atmosphere while the river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and transforms at closure. Setting details filter through Elara's professional lens as "dusk noticer." The shadow's physical behavior ("peeled itself away from the stone") grounds the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through discovery: from noting passive dream consumption to finding the shadow in old recordings to actively creating her own dream at personal cost. The dominant stake—preserving individual creative potential—tightens as Elara moves from observation to intervention, with the "peculiar draining" marking clear price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery: the shadow as "tangible manifestation of creative potential" that cannot survive "communal dream-pool" dilution. The stone's transformation from "dull grey" to "containing a miniature galaxy" offers non-literal answer to the central question of preserving hope. The "luminous regret" for lost individual aspiration avoids moralizing while charging the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the setting ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "cathedral of knowledge") with controlled rhythm that modulates during discovery beats. Some filter-verb clustering ("she realized," "she believed," "she felt") dulls immediacy in middle sections. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on visual detail and temporal transitions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong opening ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer of the Aerie") and varied sentence structures. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the research sequence and some abstract phrasing ("tangible manifestation of creative potential") that could be more concrete. The closing image of the transformed stone lands with specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of dream-sharing leading to "collective, forgetful languor" offers fresh angle on creativity versus consumption. The shadow as independent witness to creation, absent from contemporary records, provides non-obvious synthesis. The specific detail of comparing "silent video footage from decades apart" grounds the fantastical premise in tactile research methods.</comment>
