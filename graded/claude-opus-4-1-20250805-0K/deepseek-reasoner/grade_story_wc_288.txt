grade_story_wc_288.txt
I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore chain from isolation through discovery to transformation, with the sundial's activation causally enabling the library's transformation into a vessel.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation crystallizes through concrete action rather than declaration, with her three-fingered hand and tarnished scales creating immediate embodiment. The shift from "translate isolation into independence" to active navigation shows earned character growth through discovery. Minor deduction for the "brittle awakening" metaphor appearing twice without sufficient variation in meaning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from isolation through discovery to transformation, with the sundial revelation serving as decisive change that reweights the entire premise. The cost is legible in Lyra's acceptance of leaving the known world behind. The lens holds consistently throughout with clear because/therefore linkages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal library's breathing corridors and atomically reflective walls directly enable the plot solution - the walls focus light to activate the sundial. Setting constrains choice through the library's isolation and enables resolution through its hidden nature as a vessel. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lyra's archival perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation moves from wearing isolation "like a shield" to it becoming "a cage," forcing Lyra to act. The tidal surge provides the catalyst that reveals the sundial's true purpose, with clear cost in abandoning her role as preserver for pioneer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of preservation into propagation, with the sundial shift from "useless timepiece" to navigational key embodying this perfectly. The ending reweights the entire concept of extinction and legacy without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "cloud-reef" and "memory of her reincarnation was a sharp, recent wound" creating unique texture. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor register elevation in "raison d'être" slightly disrupts the established mythic-naturalistic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silence...was a physical presence." However, "brittle awakening" repetition, filter verb clusters ("she felt," "she noticed," "she realized"), and the abstract "raison d'être" create minor friction. Information density is high but some scaffolding remains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct species archivist with living vessel creates genuine freshness. The tidal library that breathes with ocean rhythms and the atomically reflective walls that become functional plot elements show strong conceptual integration. Risk-taking in the genre-blending pays off.</comment>
