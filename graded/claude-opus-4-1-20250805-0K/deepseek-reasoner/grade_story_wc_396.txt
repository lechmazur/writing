<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation—mapping empathy onto action—drives her choice to investigate rather than report, with internal contradiction between duty and moral impulse playing out through concrete action. The final choice to alert engineers rather than peacekeepers shows earned character change with visible cost (risking her position). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("calmly intuitive" reads as label) and the transformation feeling slightly rushed in the compressed timeframe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change closure: Kaelen prevents catastrophe by choosing engineers over peacekeepers, with visible cost (breaking her sworn duty). Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from fragment's vision to mirror investigation to valve discovery to intervention. The "reconstituting a broken future into a mended present" lands with earned resonance. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the valve discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and vintage store create vivid, constraining environments—the mirrors specifically enable the investigation method. Strong sensory work with "frost-bitten apples" and "dust and ghosts of lavender sachets." The ice floes' "groaning shift" and final "faithful" groan bookend effectively. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("labyrinthine city") and the engineering corps location appearing without prior spatial anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from observation duty to vision of catastrophe to active prevention. The pressure tightens through mirror-by-mirror revelation building to the valve discovery. Kaelen's agency drives every turn, with visible cost in breaking her peacekeeper conditioning. Minor deduction for the valve solution feeling slightly neat, though the "chain of events" framing helps justify it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: individual moral courage versus institutional duty, with the fragment as "plea" not threat. The mirrors-as-fractured-truth metaphor works without overstatement. "Reconstituting" truth from glimpses resonates with the broader question of how we perceive and prevent disaster. Slight deduction for the ending's mild tidiness in resolving the tension between duty and empathy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with shadow-based imagery and Kaelen's measured, observant voice. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent action. Some excellent phrases ("weighted breath before reply"). Deductions for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit ("courageous anomaly" feels prompt-inserted) and some filter-heavy passages in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend with the groaning ice. Information density is solid with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some repetitive phrasing ("glimpses" appears frequently), occasional overwriting ("absolute zero" feels hyperbolic), and a few abstract constructions that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The shadow-peacekeeper observing ice floes offers a fresh worldbuilding angle. Using mirrors to fracture and reconstitute a vision is inventive, avoiding simple prophecy tropes. The specific solution (valve repair) grounds the fantastical premise in mechanical reality. Minor deduction for the somewhat familiar "chosen one defies orders to save everyone" arc, though the execution elevates it.</comment>
