<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to give voice to the voiceless mirrors her own silenced state, creating genuine internal resonance. The progression from trapped silence to rediscovered voice is earned through concrete action (encoding the ghost's essence). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing like "tinkersong wonder" that verges on precious rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Elara regains her voice through giving voice to another. The cost is visible—her long silence, the risk of the encoding process during the storm. The piece teaches its pattern of connection through art/encoding early and pays it off. Slight deduction for the convenience of the solution arriving so readily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting effectively isolates and elevates the action, with the storm providing natural pressure. The flower press bolt plate as interface is specific and tactile. The graffiti art backstory adds texture. Deduction for some vague spatial choreography and the setting not constraining choices as much as it could.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—develops through the encoding process with the storm as deadline pressure. The lightning strike provides a decisive moment. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance; the encoding proceeds too smoothly without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would elevate the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection across different states of being emerges organically through the parallel between Elara and the ghost. The graffiti as desperate communication attempts resonates. The final gallery as permanent voice is earned. Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution of both finding their voices simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical touches appropriate to a balladeer protagonist. "Tinkersong wonder" and similar phrases establish voice distinctiveness. The prose rhythm accelerates during the encoding sequence. Some filter phrases like "she felt" could be stronger, and occasional overwriting ("silence was a physical weight") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several abstract phrases lack specificity ("beautiful, broken symphony," "raw data of emotion"), and there's some repetition of concept words (voice/voiceless appears 8 times). The "tinkersong" coinage feels forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code consciousness seeking expression through graffiti art is fresh. The flower press bolt plate as digital-soul interface shows creativity. However, the resolution feels somewhat safe—both characters getting exactly what they need without meaningful sacrifice diminishes the boldness.</comment>
