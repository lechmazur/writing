<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "graft herself onto community" drives consistent choices throughout, from joining the search to her final act of bridge-building. The artist character works well as a mirror, though their development is minimal. The final choice to protect rather than expose shows genuine internal conflict resolved through action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and community bonds deepen toward Elara's final act of weaving the luminescent sculpture. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she creates "a collaboration across distance" that transforms both the arbor and the community's understanding. Cost is visible in her dedication of "hands and art" and the trust she bears. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor create a vivid, specific world where "geodesic fruit hummed with captured light." Setting actively shapes choices—the marsh provides Elara's materials and expertise that lead her to the artist. The glowing moss and luminescent qualities create coherent atmosphere that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal need for belonging to bearing the weight of both "the artist's trust and the community's hope." The search deepens connections and narrows to Elara's discovery, forcing her choice between exposure and protection. Cost is clear when she dedicates her art to build a bridge rather than claim discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection across silence emerges through concrete actions—the tag as "offering," the search strengthening "webs of kinship," and Elara's final sculpture as living collaboration. The ending image of "a world learning to speak again" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "quiet void."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "luminescent ache" and "beautiful, painful yearning." POV stays controlled with Elara's marsh-sculptor perspective filtering observations. Some elevated diction ("boldly sympathetic nature") occasionally drifts from character register but rhythm supports the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("beautiful, painful yearning," "boldly sympathetic" used twice). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template patterns in "She knew...She raised...She would not" sequence but momentum remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic quiet with art-as-connection offers fresh angle on community-building. The choice to protect rather than expose the artist subverts expected resolution. Specific details like "geodesic fruit" and luminescent moss create memorable world-building beyond generic post-disaster settings.</comment>
