<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma response with contradictory impulses (freeze vs. run) and earned resolution through grandmother's wisdom leading to grounded recovery. The somatic markers create authentic PTSD portrayal without diagnostic language. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the grandmother's memory surfacing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara moves from frozen trauma to "planting" despite darkness, with visible cost in the "settled weight" of the photograph. The pearl metaphor transforms from abstract wisdom to concrete survival technique. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wind-sculpted pines mirror Elara's psychological state effectively, with the parallel-bent tree serving as crucial anchor point during panic. The arboretum functions as both refuge and pressure point when the jet sound invades. Setting constrains choice when she freezes rather than reaching the greenhouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single meaningful escalation from calm tending to triggered panic attack, with agency shown through active grounding technique rather than passive endurance. The cost is legible in her ongoing trauma ("a ghost she carried"). One-beat structure appropriate for length but lacks the visceral price that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of finding stillness within storm, avoiding stated morals. The final image of "planting" while "the light was gone" offers resonant answer about persistence despite trauma. Strong integration of wind-bent trees as natural metaphor for resilience under constant pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara notices textures and uses tactile grounding, with controlled psychic distance shifts during panic. Voice maintains consistency through crisis with appropriate compression ("All she could do was freeze"). Minor template cadence in some descriptive passages ("She was...", "She had...").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a woman quietly talented in the art of going unnoticed" and the visceral panic sequence. Some filter verb clustering ("She noticed," "She heard") and mild overwriting in metaphorical density ("fossil of lost happiness"). Information density good but occasional redundancy in trauma description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh treatment of PTSD through somatic grounding technique rather than typical flashback structure. The "pearl of stillness" concept transforms cliché into specific survival method. Wind-sculpted trees as trauma metaphor avoids obvious symbolism while maintaining resonance.</comment>
