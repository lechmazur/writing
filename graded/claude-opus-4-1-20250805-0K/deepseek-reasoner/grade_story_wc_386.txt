<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find "the one unbroken thing in a world of fragments" drives consistent choices through dream-diving and ghost resolution. The officer's shame/heroism contradiction plays out in scene with embodied details (melted globe, fighting to locked cabin). Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("deep shame," "lingering attachment") that could be more embodied, but the final choice to complete the unfinished promise lands with visible emotional cost in the daughter's dream.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with dream fragments building to the officer's story and resolution through the daughter's crafted dream. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the melted globe transforms from "token of loss" to "window that had finally been closed," with felt cost in both the officer's release and daughter's peace. Orientation anchors (glacier shrine, Elara as wreck-diver) establish by ~80 words. The because/therefore linkage from analyzing dreams to finding the officer to crafting resolution holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine's "cold was a living presence" and walls with "borrowed" light create atmospheric pressure, while the melted snow globe serves as micro-setting that constrains the ghost's attachment and enables resolution. Sensory detail effectively narrows during vision sequences (screams swallowed, wall of water and fire). The shrine's candles flaring then settling to "softer, steadier flame" physically manifests the ghost's peace, though more tactile detail of Elara's physical experience in the frigid space would strengthen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of granting peace to trapped spirits escalates through discovering the officer's true final act (not cowardice but heroism), with the melted globe as physical anchor of his unfinished promise. The tightening occurs when Elara must "expose the full truth... not to condemn him, but to absolve him," forcing her to craft a specific dream that completes the loop. Cost is visible in the officer's consumed corridor death and the daughter's seventy years of "troubling dreams of the sea."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of completing unfinished connections emerges through the melted globe's transformation from "perfect, ruined metaphor" to delivered gift. The story resists simple redemption—the officer still died, the globe remains melted—but finds meaning in intent finally reaching its target. The final image of light now "earned, not borrowed" resonantly answers whether peace can be salvaged from wreckage without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances technical precision ("spectral signatures," "collective unconscious") with poetic compression ("silence between the living and the dead"). POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature of reading dreams and sensing ghostly weight. Minor register elevation in places ("visceral horror," "accumulated prayers") slightly exceeds the established voice, but rhythm effectively modulates during the vision sequence with shorter, more urgent syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "cold was a living presence" and the globe as "perfect, ruined metaphor." Some template phrasing appears ("closed her eyes," "opened her eyes" repeated) and filter constructions ("she felt his terror," "feeling the officer's lingering attachment"). The phrase "accumulated prayers of centuries frozen in time" borders on overwriting but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-whispering through dream analysis offers a fresh angle on supernatural communication, avoiding séance clichés. The melted snow globe as both failed gift and anchor for redemption provides specific, non-obvious symbolism. The story commits to its premise of finding "windows of connection" through strangers' dreams without retreating to safer territory, though the resolution mechanism of crafting a dream for the daughter feels slightly convenient.</comment>
