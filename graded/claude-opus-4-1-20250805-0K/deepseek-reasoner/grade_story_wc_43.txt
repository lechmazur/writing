<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific ("execute a flawless goodbye"), driving concrete micro-choices like using the tone bar on vinyl. Arthur's emotional progression from clinical awareness to transcendent recognition of Eleanor feels earned through the music-making scene. The choice to play memory rather than melody reveals character values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the "pulsing stillness" transforms to "eternal and deep" with Arthur's death as visible cost. The vinyl fragment accumulates meaning from broken love token to reunion instrument. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (hospice, Arthur in bed, Elara as therapist).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" setting provides both symbolic resonance and practical constraint (hospice as liminal space). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the "clean, sharp aroma of ozone" mixing with "lemon polish" creates specificity. The vinyl fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's choice of how to create music.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from clinical confirmation ("matter of hours") through emotional revelation (broken record) to transcendent reunion. The dominant stake—providing peaceful death—tightens as Elara must innovate with the broken vinyl rather than conventional music therapy. Cost is visible in Arthur's death, though agency remains primarily with Elara.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of "hymning the mundane"—making sacred music from broken plastic. The ending reweights the entire piece: brokenness becomes wholeness, professional service becomes spiritual facilitation. "She had used a broken thing to make something whole" crystallizes without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Elara notices in professional terms ("serene hospice music therapist"), Arthur in memories. Voice modulates effectively from clinical ("crisp and definitive") to transcendent ("ethereal, scratchy music"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("exquisite precision") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("radiant haven" used twice, "exquisite precision"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. The final image of "soft, cloud-filtered light" effectively closes without redundancy. Minor template patterns in emotional description ("His eyes welled," "smile touched his lips").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core innovation—using a tone bar on broken vinyl to create memory rather than melody—feels fresh and specific. The transformation of professional duty into spiritual facilitation avoids sentimentality through concrete detail. While death-bed scenes are familiar, the specific method and "hymning the mundane" concept provides originality.</comment>
