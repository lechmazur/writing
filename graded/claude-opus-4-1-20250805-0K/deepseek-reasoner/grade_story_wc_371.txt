<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the sacred in the ordinary drives concrete actions throughout, with the fossilized bread serving as catalyst for guerrilla gardening. The final image of the businesswoman kneeling to smell the calendula shows earned transformation through accumulated small acts. Minor deduction for Anya remaining somewhat functional rather than applying pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases from noticing decay to active beautification, with the bread-as-seed providing material linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara witnesses "uncommodified grace" in the businesswoman's pause, proving their intervention works. Cost is visible in the "tenuous absolution" and "fragile forgiveness" of their pre-dawn ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house provide sanctuary that enables planning, while the sterile concrete wall where the bakery stood becomes ground zero for transformation. Sensory details like "gritty, fragrant dust" and "deep blue hour before dawn" support the ritualistic tone. Setting constrains choices through forgotten spaces becoming sites of intervention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private mourning of lost bakery to public beautification campaign, with the bread's transformation into seed mixture marking the decisive turn. The guerrilla gardening carries risk of "not asking permission," though consequences remain implicit. Final image of businesswoman experiencing the flower shows their intervention succeeds in creating moments of grace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bread's transformation from fossil to seed, literalizing resurrection of lost value through patient cultivation. The final witness of "uncommodified grace" reweights all prior acts of noticing and planting as sacred work. Subtext operates through silence between Elara and Anya, their shared memory of taste, and the communion-like ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac tone with phrases like "creeping normality" and "heuristically gentle" establishing literary register. Perceptual signature shows in Elara's specific noticing of decay and transformation. Some register elevation ("tenuous absolution," "uncommodified grace") slightly exceeds naturalistic bounds but serves thematic purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("deep blue hour before dawn," "fossil, a perfect, petrified sourdough boule") with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate with some passages doing single duty. Minor redundancy in thematic statements ("sacred in the ordinary" concept repeated) and occasional abstract phrasing ("relentless progress") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fossilized bread as seed for guerrilla gardening offers fresh angle on urban renewal narrative. "Heuristically gentle" as character trait and the secret tea house setting provide specific texture. The quiet ending of witnessing transformation rather than declaring victory shows restraint, though the core concept of beauty-as-resistance is somewhat familiar.</comment>
