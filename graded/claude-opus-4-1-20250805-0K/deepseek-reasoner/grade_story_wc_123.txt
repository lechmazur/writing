<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's methodical nature and scientific curiosity drive her investigation convincingly, with embodied tension ("tightened her shoulders") and concrete micro-choices (activating weather station, cross-referencing data). The final act of sending evidence via pigeon shows earned agency with visible cost—risking exposure during curfew. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("nurture integrity in solitude") that feels abstract rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal drive: being followed → receiving message → lateral investigation → sending proof. Closure lands as Charged Poise with Elara crystallizing her stance by releasing evidence into danger, cost visible in the risk taken. The "lateral" investigation method pays off through cross-referenced data revealing the truth. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the quarantine's significance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The weather station and data monitors constrain Elara's investigation method effectively, while the courtyard provides both sanctuary and the pigeon's entry point. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("slate-grey carrier pigeon," "deep blue of twilight"). The contrast between "layered tranquility" and underlying tension works well, though some descriptions remain functional rather than fully constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal safety (being followed) through discovery (message) to moral imperative (exposing lies), with the curfew siren adding time pressure. Elara's choice to record and transmit evidence rather than flee shows agency with clear cost—risking detection. The dominant stake of truth versus safety tightens effectively, though the middle investigation section could use slightly more pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: institutional deception versus individual integrity, with Elara's solitary pursuit of truth embodying the central question. The pigeon as desperate analog communication bypassing digital surveillance adds thematic texture. The ending image of truth flying "into the silent, layered night" resonates without stating a moral, though the message content itself edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific precision ("cross-referenced particulate matter readings") fitting Elara's profession, with controlled modulation during stress. POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering through her analytical lens. Some passages drift toward explanatory ("This was no flu quarantine") rather than maintaining embodied perspective, and dialogue absence prevents full range assessment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with purposeful variation, though some template phrasing appears ("She looked from...to," "She would not...she would"). Information density is good in investigation sequences. Minor loops in emotional description ("rattled nerves," "trepidation," "curiosity") and some filter verb clustering ("she noticed," "she thought," "she saw") reduce immediacy without serving voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lateral investigation method—using weather data to expose non-medical operations—offers fresh angle on surveillance state tropes. The pigeon as analog bypass of digital monitoring shows ingenuity. Specific technical details (particulate counts, acoustic monitors, thermal signatures) ground the concept credibly, though the quarantine deception itself is somewhat familiar territory.</comment>
