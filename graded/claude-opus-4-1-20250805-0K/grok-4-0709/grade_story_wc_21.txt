<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation burns with clarity and his retrocognitive entrapment creates genuine internal conflict through embodied visions. The shift from archivist to activist embodiment works, though the specter's motivations remain somewhat abstract ("FEAR DIVIDED US"). Final choice to offer forgiveness shows values hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through diary discovery → retrocognitive trap → debris parley → truth revelation, with the obsidian lagoon serving as a resonant anchor. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias gains the buried evidence, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral. The "searing reverie" and "embers" create textural density that reweights the archival mission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and metaphor, its "glassy black mirror reflecting distorted memories" constraining Elias's choices in the retrocognitive space. Beach debris becomes tools that enable communication, while the dunes threaten burial. The zeppelin library frames the ethereal nature of history's preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: encrypted diary → retrocognitive trap → failed verbal parley → debris messages → confession → final map revelation. The stakes tighten as "the reverie scorching his mind with the intensity of unresolved pain," though the specter's responses feel somewhat convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between solidarity and survival, with the obsidian lagoon reflecting "distorted memories" of betrayal. The debris-message parley literalizes the fragmentary nature of historical truth. Final image of Elias as "solemn guardian of history's hidden fires" resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice maintains elevated register appropriate to the premise, with controlled rhythm in passages like "shells clattering as if alive with regret." POV remains stable through the retrocognitive shift. Some register drift occurs ("searing reverie," "ethereal trap") but serves the heightened reality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dunes rose like silent sentinels") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias's motivation burned fiercely," "the reverie seared his senses," "searing reverie," "searing dreamscape"). Template cadence appears in the debris-message sequence. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely describe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap mechanism and debris-message parley offer fresh angles on historical investigation. The obsidian lagoon as repository of betrayal creates a specific, memorable image. However, the civil rights march backstory feels somewhat generic, lacking the lived detail that would fully transform the familiar template.</comment>
