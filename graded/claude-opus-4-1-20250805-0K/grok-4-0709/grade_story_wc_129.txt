<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirah's motivation to graft onto community is clear and drives choices throughout, but interiority relies on abstract phrases like "luminescent ache of isolation deep in her bones" rather than embodied contradiction. The final dedication choice lands with visible community integration, though the emotional progression from isolation to belonging follows predictable stages without compelling internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the search and discovery sequence, culminating in Lirah's acceptance via the obsidian arbor dedication (Resonant Reconfiguration). However, the cost remains largely abstract—"glowing pain of belonging" doesn't translate to visible sacrifice or foreclosed options. The search-to-integration arc coheres but lacks the decisive tightening that would elevate stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard with its quartz fruits and crater fumes creates a distinctive post-apocalyptic setting that frames the community's isolation. Setting constrains choices when searchers navigate "perilous edges where the crater's fumes whispered temptations of oblivion," though this danger never materializes into actual cost or consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of belonging progresses through the shared search, with mild escalation as fragments reveal kinship ties. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—the search proceeds smoothly without setbacks, and Lirah's acceptance feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of connection through shared endeavor emerges through the search ritual and arbor creation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the arbor as beacon for future grafting offers resonance, though the "cycle of ache and luminescence" leans toward abstraction rather than earned complexity from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "crystalline orchard" and "luminescent ache," but this elevated diction creates distance rather than intimacy. No dialogue appears despite multiple characters present, missing opportunities for voice distinction and subtext during the communal search.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with abstract figurative language: "luminescent ache," "glowing void," "beautiful pain of remembering." Template phrasing appears in "Lirah, driven by her bold sympathy" and "Years passed in the crystalline orchard." The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, with multiple sentences restating isolation or connection without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The post-linguistic world where "words had dissolved into echoes" offers a fresh frame for exploring connection, and the marsh-reed sculptor working with crystal materials creates textural interest. However, the transformation from outsider to integral thread follows a predictable arc without surprising turns or genuine risk.</comment>
