<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—navigating grief after his lover's death—drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied sensory absorption and the quiet blaze metaphor creating genuine interiority. The final transformation from grief to acceptance feels earned through the journey's accumulated sensory languages, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without deeper internal contradiction at the stillpoint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory density building toward the stillpoint's "language of peace," creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms to acceptance. Cost is felt through the emotional journey and time's pause, though the transformation lacks a sharper trade-off—Elara gains peace without visibly sacrificing his connection to Liran's memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions as more than backdrop—its frequencies, absorbed languages, and musical trail actively guide Elara's navigation, with the stillpoint serving as both physical destination and emotional resolution. Sensory details like "tingling pulse against his skin" and the moss's ancient tongue create lived-in specificity that constrains his journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating sensory languages that sharpen Elara's perception, leading to the stillpoint discovery where "all sounds canceled into profound silence." The quiet blaze intensifies as he approaches resolution, though the journey lacks a moment where Elara must choose between competing paths or face potential failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding peace through embracing rather than escaping sensation emerges organically through Elara's absorption of languages—from earth's cycles to musical harmonics to final silence. The stillpoint as "nexus of calm amid ceaseless vibrations" offers a non-literal answer about grief's resolution without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "fingers that danced like spiders on silk" and controlled rhythm that mirrors Elara's methodical search. The perceptual signature—a blind mapmaker experiencing through touch and absorbed languages—creates distinct texture, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("elongated moment to delve inward").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("stars pausing in their eternal dance") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"subdued fire that illuminated his grief without consuming him" could be half as long. Template structures appear in the middle section ("He began to dowse... The ring trembled... As he walked..."), though the final passages regain momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a blind mapmaker who absorbs languages through skin offers genuine freshness, especially combined with ultrasonic navigation and the stillpoint as emotional/physical destination. The synthesis of sensory compensation with grief navigation feels specific and earned, avoiding template resolution.</comment>
