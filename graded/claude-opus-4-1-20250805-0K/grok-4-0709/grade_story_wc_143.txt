I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered details about the grain, chemical reactions, and mounting melancholy toward Elena's final photograph capturing the grain's dissolution at dawn.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and her purposeful curiosity drives consistent action. The internal conflict between preserving and witnessing loss creates genuine tension. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("melancholy swelled within her") rather than embodied contradiction, and the character lacks specific flaws that complicate her vigil.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well, building from crater discovery through vigil to the grain's dissolution. The closure - photographing the grain's vanishing glow - lands with felt cost as Elena preserves what cannot be saved. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moonlit summit setting effectively pressures Elena through cold and isolation. Sensory details like "frost-kissed rocks" and "crunching on lunar-like gravel" create atmosphere. The grain-in-vial functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image when it dissolves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - capturing the grain's final act - is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through timed chemical messages and the approaching dawn, with one meaningful tightening as the grain begins glowing. However, Elena faces no real opposition or complication that might force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between space age progress and vanishing quiet moments. The dawning hush concept integrates naturally without exposition. The final image of digital preservation against irreversible loss offers resonant commentary on what technology can and cannot save.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture. POV remains stable with appropriate access to Elena's thoughts. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("poignant sorrow for the irreplaceable") that doesn't match the technical inspector character, and perceptual signature could be more selective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose clarity generally serves the story, though several template constructions appear ("Elena shivered...Elena paced...Elena's breath caught"). Abstract phrasing like "melancholy tugged at her heart" and "hollow ache" weakens specificity. Information density is moderate but could be tighter, particularly in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of preserving the last grain of nightwatch sand through chemical reactions offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of space age setting with ancient vigil traditions creates non-obvious resonance. The specific method of timed chemical messages that dissolve the very thing being preserved shows inventive irony.</comment>
