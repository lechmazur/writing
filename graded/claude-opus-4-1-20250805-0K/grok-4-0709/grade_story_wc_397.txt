I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's altered perception and motivation crystallize effectively through concrete embodied details—the parasol tip probing ice, her changed senses interpreting "groans of shifting ice." The fold in patience lands with genuine cost as "waiting gave way to acceptance," though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("reality slipped through her fingers").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Earned Stasis—Elara accepts her changed state and continues volunteering, with visible cost in her transformed perception. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and disaster work accumulate toward the final reweighting. However, the botched surgery's causality remains vague, slightly weakening the setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina creates genuine constraint—"bobbing docks encrusted with drift-ice," "glacial fragments," gale-force winds threatening the camp. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, its "delicate silver filigree" contrasting powerfully with Arctic desolation while enabling her trawling method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: volunteer boat capsizing, gale-force winds fracturing ice, reality slipping "entirely." The cost manifests in Elara's transformed state—no longer seeking death but "anchored in the marina's frozen embrace," though the middle lacks a sharp pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parasol's transformation from "fragile barrier against the sun's glare" to Arctic divining rod, and patience folding "not in despair, but in release." The final image of "beginning folded within" ending resonates without stating its moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in Elara's altered state—"whispers of the world while dulling sharp edges," seeing "spectral figures amid the floes." Some register elevation occurs ("capricious currents," "preludes to finality") but stays mostly within the lyric mode's bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments like "clutched in her gloved palm" and "groans of shifting ice" demonstrate precision. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("echoes of lives upended," "preludes to finality," "undercurrents of loss") and some paraphrase loops appear ("approaching endings"/"sound of approaching endings").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist seeking death but finding transformed purpose through botched surgery offers genuine freshness. The parasol tip as Arctic tool and patience folding as release rather than despair show specific invention, though some metaphors feel slightly elevated.</comment>
