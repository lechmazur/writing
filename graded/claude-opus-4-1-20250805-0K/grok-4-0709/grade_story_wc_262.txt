I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and psychometric visions toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara discovers that unused love is archived in memory spaces, transforming her understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific ("to find where unused love is stored"), with concrete embodied action through psychometry. The internal progression from seeking to understanding feels earned through the film strip visions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unused love" that could be more grounded in specific loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers love is "stored in the interstices of memory." The psychometry visions of Harlan provide causal linkage, and the final realization that her own unused loves are "similarly archived" creates clear before/after with emotional cost. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the closure's "symphony of the heart" metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth setting actively constrains and enables the story - it's where Harlan's memories are stored, where the film strip is found, and serves as "a vault for the heart's overlooked treasures." Vivid sensory details like "dust motes danced like silent specters" and "walls etched with decades of projector heat" create atmosphere that supports the quest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) progresses through discovery of the film strip, psychometric reading revealing Harlan's story, and final understanding. The escalation from seeking to finding to understanding shows clear deepening under the accumulative lens, with emotional cost visible in "hushed thunder" building to revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that unused love persists in physical spaces and objects. The goodbye letters concept resonates through Harlan's unsent missives to Elara's own archived affections. The final transformation from "goodbyes" to "new beginnings" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled elevated diction fitting a crystal gazer's perspective ("liminal hour," "psychometry," "interstices"). Some overwrought phrases ("dust motes danced like silent specters") but rhythm modulates effectively with discovery. The perceptual signature of spatial imagination is consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of overwriting: "hushed thunder" appears three times, some purple passages ("infinite theater," "symphony of the heart"). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("incubate visions" shifts awkwardly). Information density is high but sometimes tips into ornamental description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of crystal gazer using psychometry in a projection booth to find unused love shows genuine synthesis. The specific detail of Harlan writing on film strips is inventive. However, the abstract nature of "unused love" and some familiar mystical tropes (crystal gazer, psychic visions) prevent higher originality.</comment>
