<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited shame, driving him to seek redemption through truth-telling. The internal conflict between his skepticism and need for authentic silence plays out through concrete actions (entering the lighthouse, touching the lattice, speaking confessions). However, the ghosts' sudden appearance and his immediate understanding of their needs feels slightly unearned, and the emotional progression from doubt to peace happens too smoothly without sufficient internal resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) as Elias completes his confession and finds peace, with visible cost in confronting his father's legacy. The accumulative/textural lens holds as copperlight imagery and the hush motif build toward the final calm. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality tracks cleanly. The cost could be more visceral at the closure moment—"his repose remained, an impossible calm sustained within" tells rather than embodies the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting actively constrains Elias's journey through its spiral architecture and the confessional lattice that becomes the focal point for transformation. Vivid sensory details ("iron beams groaning," "salt and regret," "copperlight filtering through rusted grates") create atmosphere while the spatial choreography from base to chapel tracks clearly. The setting directly enables the story's resolution through the lattice's supernatural properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking redemption from inherited lies—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulative pressure of climbing toward the chapel and the intensification when ghosts appear. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance; Elias achieves his goal relatively easily once he understands what's needed, and the ticking clock of "before they find the bodies" never creates real pressure since we don't see consequences approaching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete exploration of inherited sin and the possibility of redemption through truth-telling. The confessional lattice works as both literal object and thematic vehicle, while the ghosts embody the weight of unspoken truths. The final image of Elias rowing away with "impossible calm sustained within" offers a resonant answer about peace earned through confronting family legacy, though it edges toward explicit statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("chased hush," "thread a labyrinth"). The perceptual signature shows Elias noticing details through his lens of seeking truth and silence. Some phrases feel overwrought ("where prisoners once chased hush in isolation"), and the shift to more direct narration in the ghost encounter section briefly disrupts the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures that create momentum. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "copperlight repose" repeats four times, creating a pattern that feels forced; phrases like "whispered their sins to the sea" and "bloodline—his father's lies had summoned real wolves" edge toward purple prose. The abstract phrasing around "sustaining impossibilities" and "threading the labyrinth" occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of the cry-wolf boy's son seeking redemption in a lighthouse prison offers a fresh angle on inherited guilt. The synthesis of confession, spectral prisoners, and the specific "copperlight" atmosphere creates a memorable world. However, the ghost revelation and immediate understanding of their needs follows familiar paranormal patterns without sufficient transformation, and the resolution feels somewhat predictable once the supernatural element appears.</comment>
