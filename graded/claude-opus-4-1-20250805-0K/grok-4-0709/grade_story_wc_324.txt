I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal trauma, driving her curiosity and protective instincts consistently. The internal conflict between pursuing her own lost connection versus helping the intercepted signal creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the resolution lacks the visceral embodiment that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's act of delivering the message transforms both the living woman's despair and the dead man's unrest, with the cost being Elara's abandonment of her original pursuit. The accumulative/textural lens holds as atmospheric details and emotional residues build toward the final healing. Causality remains intact though the coincidental interception of the signal prevents entry to the highest band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as more than backdrop—its condensation, shadows, and "reeling hush" constrain perception and guide movement through the space. The hearing aid as micro-setting enables key choices and the photograph physically bridges worlds. Setting details filter through Elara's professional lens as a "contact tracer for hearts," though some descriptions lean toward the atmospheric rather than fully constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices from being unheard—escalates from detecting the signal to tracking it to delivering the message, with Elara sacrificing her own quest. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as details compound. However, the resolution relies partially on coincidence (finding the exact photograph, the woman still being alive), and the cost, while present, could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "contact tracing for hearts"—tracking emotional residues across time. The final image of Elara's "own heart mending slightly" offers a non-literal answer about how helping others can heal oneself. Subtext operates effectively through the hearing aid's function and the photograph's deterioration, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("proving that tracing hearts could heal more than intended").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and POV control, with perceptual details filtered through Elara's specialized awareness ("erratic beats that mimicked heart rhythms"). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("mist-clad atrium," "emotional residues") that slightly exceeds the established voice's natural lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates solid clarity with atmospheric phrases like "fog swirled like forgotten breaths" creating texture. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, several instances of elevated diction ("unyielding motivation," "persistently curious nature") and repetitive phrasing around "vulnerable voices" and "reeling hush" create mild scaffold that prevents higher scoring, though these don't touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of using a repurposed hearing aid to trace emotional residues offers a fresh angle on ghost stories. The specific synthesis of contact tracing metaphor with supernatural communication feels non-obvious. The story commits to its premise without retreat, though it plays somewhat safe in its resolution—the expected delivery of message to grieving widow—rather than taking bolder risks with the concept.</comment>
