<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows consistent motivation through seeking joy beneath anguish, and his choice to preserve rather than burn the diary demonstrates agency with implied cost. However, his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we're told about his grief and isolation but don't see these impulses acting simultaneously against his curiosity during key moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through diary revelations, culminating in Elias's transformation from "ascending servant no more, but a keeper of encrypted light"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The closure lands cleanly, though the cost of preservation versus burning could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire creates consistent atmospheric pressure through "perpetual ice," "scattered prisms," and the creaky elevator's ascent, with sensory details like "fingers, numb from the cold." The setting constrains choices (cold limiting dexterity, elevator's fixed path) but doesn't quite charge the final image as strongly as it could.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating diary revelations that reweight Elias's understanding, from cipher-breaking to discovering the architect's love story to the ritual instructions. The dominant stake—finding meaning in isolation—tightens as each floor reveals deeper parallels to Elias's own loss, though the final choice lacks immediate dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the diary's parallel journey of "anguish of endless winter, I sought the joy of fleeting warmth" mirroring Elias's own quest. The final image of "keeper of encrypted light" offers a non-literal answer about preserving rather than releasing joy, avoiding moralizing while maintaining resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with appropriate lexicon ("trepidation," "affectionate detachment") and clean free indirect style. However, syntactic variety is limited with repetitive "Elias [verb]" constructions, and the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things generically rather than through his specific servant-turned-aide lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose clarity suffers from overwriting in places ("clouds like a frozen needle," "fireflies," "elusive") and template cadence across floor progressions ("Fifth floor... Sixth floor..."). Information density is moderate but several paragraphs could be cut without losing essential pressure, particularly the middle diary revelations that repeat similar emotional territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovered during an elevator ascent offers a fresh frame for the servant-promotion narrative, with the goggles-as-decoder adding specificity. However, the emotional arc of finding joy beneath anguish follows familiar grief-processing templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
