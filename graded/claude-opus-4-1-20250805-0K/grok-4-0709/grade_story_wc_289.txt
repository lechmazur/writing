<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as keeper of secrets who yearns for his own connection is clear and drives the installation choice. The whimsical trait manifests in concrete actions (seeing the twig spiral as thread incarnate, creating the floating lantern installation). However, Mira's sudden appearance and recognition feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality, and her immediate understanding of his need lacks the resistance expected under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias shifts from ghostwriting others' love to sharing his own truth, with emotional cost visible in his years of yearning. The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery builds toward the final connection. However, the resolution relies on Mira's convenient arrival and instant recognition, weakening causality at the crucial turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond create vivid atmosphere through "petals carved from pale stone" and "prismatic quiet" after the storm. The thrush's nest becomes micro-setting that constrains choice when Elias uses it as the installation's anchor. The sensory palette effectively balances visual and tactile elements, though the village arrival feels generic compared to the temple's specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking connection after years of ghostwriting for others—is clear early. The installation represents agency through public action rather than private writing. However, escalation relies on Mira's coincidental appearance rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and her instant recognition/response lacks the friction that would create genuine cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The thread metaphor elegantly connects the thrush's spiral, human connections, and Elias's role as keeper of secrets. The installation invites collective participation in weaving connection, avoiding simple resolution. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("You've kept so many secrets—perhaps it's time to share your own") approaches thematic echo, though it's saved by being Mira's dialogue rather than narratorial summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("In the hush that followed the cloud bursts"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias sees poetic connections (spiral as thread, installation as tapestry). Brief dialogue feels natural with subtext, though Mira's lines edge toward over-articulation for the emotional moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. However, repetitive "keeper of secrets" appears three times, and some passages lean purple ("mist-shrouded dawn," "kaleidoscope of fanciful notions"). The phrase "inevitably whimsical" reads as forced insertion rather than organic description. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The public art installation as means of connection offers a fresh angle on the love letter ghostwriter premise. The thrush's nest spiral as natural mandala provides specific detail. However, the resolution through convenient recognition and instant mutual understanding follows familiar patterns without transformation, and the safety of the ending avoids risk.</comment>
