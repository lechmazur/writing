I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery and pattern recognition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias's understanding crystallizes through Mira's ghostly presence and the stained glass box.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's tranquil perception drives authentic discovery through observation rather than action, with his motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" creating genuine internal tension. The character work succeeds through embodied details like his methodical unearthing of the box and contemplative gazing, though the emotional progression could push further into contradictory impulses during the discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well, building from wasteland establishment through discovery to resonant understanding, with the stained glass box serving as the pivot that reweights the covenant's meaning. The closure achieves Charged Poise as Elias crystallizes his purpose through Mira's ghostly presence, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than implied through "finding peace."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scorched oasis setting excellently constrains choices and charges meaning—the surviving bees, withered palms, and visible ghosts create a lived-in apocalyptic texture that shapes every action. The stained glass box's luminescence against decay and its placement near ancient hives creates spatial coherence that enhances the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—develops through Elias's careful excavation and contemplation of the box, with tension building through his hesitation to open it immediately. The ghostly revelation provides meaningful deepening, though the resolution lacks a sharper cost or trade-off that would elevate the emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of preservation (bees/honey), communication (mute eloquence), and loss (the wasteland), with the stained glass box serving as a perfect vessel for unspoken words. The final image of bees guarding preserved silence offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question about honoring what remains unsaid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with strong perceptual signature in observations like "ghosts flickered into sharper view under the fading light." Some passages drift toward overwrought ("scorched the earth into cracked oblivion"), but the POV holds steady through the revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates solid control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, though several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("tangled covenant," "mute eloquence"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting, particularly in descriptive passages that could achieve the same effect with more restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of visible ghosts, beekeeping preservation, and unspoken love creates genuine freshness, particularly the concept of a stained glass box preserving the "essence of unspoken words." The specific detail of surviving bees guarding emotional artifacts elevates beyond typical post-apocalyptic templates.</comment>
