I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, creating genuine stakes for redemption. The internal conflict between her need for atonement and the physical cost of the ritual lands effectively. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("weary peace negotiator," "sought redemption") rather than embodied contradiction in scene, and emotional states are told rather than felt through specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the ritual's completion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara sacrifices her vitality to anchor the peace treaty, with visible cost ("sharp pull within her chest," "eyes now dimmed"). However, the ritual mechanics feel convenient—summoning dead leaders who simply agree—and the piece lacks genuine complication or resistance that would deepen the earned quality of the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient terrace setting with its runes and celestial backdrop creates atmosphere, and sensory details like "blooming nightflowers" and "incense that curled" ground the scene. The setting constrains the ritual location effectively. But details remain generic ("weathered stone," "velvet expanse") without POV-specific filtering, and the world-building around the "forever war" stays abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the forever war through personal sacrifice—is clear early. The ritual provides escalation as spirits arrive and Elara pays the physical cost. However, conflict lacks genuine resistance; the spirits simply appear and agree without negotiation or complication, making the resolution feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through sacrifice emerges from events, and the "flawed beauty" of imperfect peace resonates in the ending image. But the piece explicitly states its themes ("price of redemption," "flawed but beautiful peace") rather than letting them arise from particulars, and the final paragraph borders on moralizing with "turning ideals into reality."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated, formal diction appropriate to epic fantasy. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices celestial movements and ancient details. However, the prose lacks distinct texture—sentences follow similar patterns, and the narrative voice feels generic rather than character-specific, missing opportunities for voice modulation under the pressure of sacrifice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence lengths and clear action sequencing. Information density is reasonable, with most sentences advancing story or atmosphere. However, multiple instances of abstract telling ("weary peace negotiator," "forever war," "flawed beauty") and repetitive structures ("She had come here," "She placed," "She addressed them") create template cadence that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ritual summoning of dead leaders to witness a peace treaty offers a fresh angle on fantasy negotiation. The concept of binding one's life force to ensure treaty compliance shows originality. However, execution relies on familiar fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation, and the resolution feels safe—spirits arrive and simply agree without unexpected complications or costs.</comment>
