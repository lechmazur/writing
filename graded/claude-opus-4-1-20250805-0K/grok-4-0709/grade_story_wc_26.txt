<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "preserve the shape of hope" drives consistent action through binding the shadow, with internal contradiction between confronting her past regret and protecting the library's harmony. The transformation from "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" to changed guardian shows earned development through specific struggle with the unbound shadow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as Elara's investigation through silent footage accumulates understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shadow transforms into a guardian with "luminous regret" lingering as felt cost. The closure lands with visible transformation on page: "the shadow bound itself to the river stone, becoming a guardian entity."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Blooming Library's "walls alive with vines" and "dream-vaults" create a specific ethereal setting that enables the central conflict with the unbound shadow. The river stone's "patterns that mirrored the flow of shared dreams" provides the crucial constraint for binding the shadow, directly shaping the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from noticing an anomaly to discovering it erodes archived hopes, then recognizing it as her own past regret, forcing the choice to bind rather than destroy it. The cost is legible: "in preserving hope's shape, she'd confronted the unbound parts of herself, forever changed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving hope while accepting regret, with the shadow's transformation from threat to guardian embodying this complexity. The final image of "luminous regret" reweights the entire premise—hope's preservation requires acknowledging what might have been.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature shows in Elara's "sharp-eyed" attention to dusk transitions and "softly deliberate" movements, maintained consistently through action verbs. Minor drift occurs in abstract passages about dream-sharing protocols, but voice recovers for the charged ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "petals unfurled in luminous regret" but suffers from conceptual abstraction ("captured essences of human reverie") and some register elevation beyond the established voice. Information density is uneven, with the middle investigation sequence carrying less propulsion than opening and closing beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an unbound shadow as externalized regret in a dream-archive library offers fresh synthesis, particularly the twist that it's Elara's own past vision. The transformation into guardian rather than destruction avoids the expected resolution.</comment>
