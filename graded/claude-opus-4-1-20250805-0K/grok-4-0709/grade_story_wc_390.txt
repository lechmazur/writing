<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's "logically emotional" nature drives authentic internal conflict throughout, particularly in his calculated yet grief-driven protection of the orb. The intruders lack development beyond function, and some emotional beats lean toward telling ("profound sorrow") rather than embodied showing. Strong micro-choices under pressure elevate the score, especially his decision to become a sonic conduit rather than fight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias's own guilt surfaces through "vibrational grace," though the cost feels more declared than visceral. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sonic patterns build to absolution, but the intruders' convenient dissolution weakens causality. Early orientation is clear; the sacred artifact stakes are established promptly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse create tangible pressure—the icy terrain disadvantages Elias physically, forcing his sonic solution. Sensory details like "azure coat whispering against skin" and "cracks forming harmonic patterns" integrate well with action. The setting constrains choices effectively, though some descriptions ("frozen ghosts," "molten amber") edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting the artifact to Elias becoming its conduit, with the intruders' arrival forcing immediate action. The sonic barrier creation shows meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the intruders' threat dissolves too easily—"threat dissolved" reads as convenient rather than earned through protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sonic absolution concept integrates thoroughly with plot mechanics and thematic exploration of forgiveness. The final image of Elias experiencing his own guilt through "vibrational grace" offers resonant closure without moralizing. Theme emerges from the lighthouse-as-beacon parallel and the orb's dual nature (weapon or absolution), though some passages edge toward explicit ("protecting the sacred artifact for those who might one day seek true sonic absolution").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm, though register occasionally drifts too ornate for an engineer-protagonist ("ethereally across the water's surface"). The perceptual signature of technical precision mixed with emotional weight works well. Some filter-heavy constructions ("Elias knew," "Elias chose") dull immediacy in action beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and purposeful paragraph structure, but overwriting accumulates—"whispering against his skin like a lover's breath" and similar flourishes appear too frequently. Template phrases like "fleshly pull" and "ethereal call" recur mechanically. Information density is moderate; several sentences could do more work, particularly in the setup.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sonic absolution mechanism offers fresh specificity—using vibrational matching as both defense and purification tool. The lighthouse engineer protecting a sound-based artifact creates organic thematic resonance. While the core conflict (guardian versus intruders) is familiar, the execution through frequency-matching and the protagonist's grief-driven expertise provide genuine particularity.</comment>
