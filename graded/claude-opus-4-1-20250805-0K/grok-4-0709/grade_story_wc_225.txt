<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to forgive himself drives consistent choices through concrete actions (fidgeting with labyrinth, decoding tapestry), with internal conflict between guilt and determination embodied in his "fierce repose." The final self-forgiveness lands with earned cost through specific acknowledgment of his chess mistake. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("knot of self-blame") and limited embodiment of emotion beyond the fidgeting gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Elias forgives himself as the curse breaks, showing visible cost in acknowledging his specific failure. The tapestry decoding accumulates pressure through pattern recognition leading to self-revelation. Slight deduction for the convenient timing of curse-breaking with self-forgiveness, though the causal link through "winnowing" truths maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village creates genuine constraint (stillness during non-thunder moments) that shapes Elias's actions, with the tapestry as micro-setting driving choices. Vivid selective detail in "cobblestone streets," "fibers woven with an eerie hush," and the platinum labyrinth's "intricate pathways." Deduction for limited sensory range beyond visual and some generic descriptors ("eternal mid-motion").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's progression from wandering to active confrontation with the tapestry, with each decoded thread revealing painful truths about his mistake. The winnowing process shows agency driving escalation with visible cost in confronting "arrogance" and "overlooking the opponent's subtle traps." Minor deduction for relatively predictable progression without significant reversal or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges through concrete actions (decoding threads, fidgeting with labyrinth) rather than statement, with the labyrinth's transformation from maze to "clear exit" providing non-literal resonance. The chess mistake becomes a "lesson etched in platinum" rather than a chain. Slight deduction for moments of thematic directness ("to forgive himself") though mostly earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on strategic/chess metaphors ("cascade of losses," "seeing the full board"). Purposeful compression in lyric mode works well with taught pattern of stillness/movement. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("fierce repose," "winnow the truths") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon and some filter-heavy passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clear prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure, particularly in action sequences. Information density high in passages like the labyrinth description serving multiple purposes. Deductions for abstract phrases ("thick with unspoken regrets"), some redundancy between "exiled" status mentioned multiple times, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy, time-frozen curse, and self-forgiveness through the specific mechanism of tapestry-decoding. The platinum labyrinth as both fidget object and metaphor for complex decisions shows originality. Slight deduction for somewhat familiar redemption arc structure, though the specific combination and "fierce repose" tone distinguish it.</comment>
