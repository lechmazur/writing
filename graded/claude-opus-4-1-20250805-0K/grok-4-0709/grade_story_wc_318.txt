<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias's spectral motivation is clear and consistent—restoring joy to his grieving family through gentle persistence rather than force. The "mournfully eager" characterization manifests effectively in his nightly ritual with the ghostly leaf blower. Deduction for slight abstraction in emotional states ("shadowed grief," "unspoken sorrow") rather than fully embodied specificity, though the final transformation shows concrete change through "muffled chuckles" and shared memories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the family's gradual transformation from sealed grief to restored laughter shows clear before/after with emotional cost ("knowing that some symphonies played on forever"). The piece teaches its ghost-story logic early and maintains coherent causality through the spectral wind carrying memories upward. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed cataloging of effects in paragraphs 15-16 rather than dwelling in one transformative moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel functions as both literal setting and metaphorical space, with dripping pipes and fissures enabling Elias's method. Vivid sensory work in "twisted like veins beneath the city" and the tunnel's amplification of sounds. The setting constrains his ghostly action to this specific method of wind-carried lullabies through ceiling cracks, directly shaping the story's tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring family joy—remains clear throughout with escalation through nightly persistence and accumulating effects. The "maceration" metaphor effectively captures the gentle breaking down of grief barriers. Cost is visible in Elias's eternal vigil and the family's gradual opening requires confronting buried pain. Slight deduction for predictable resolution without significant complication or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "tending to the unspoken"—grief's silencing effect and the healing power of acknowledged memory. The leaf blower transforms from comic instrument to poignant ghost-tool, avoiding sentimentality through its inherent absurdity. The ending's "some symphonies played on forever" resonates without explicit moralizing, reweighting the entire haunting as both burden and gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice with effective rhythm modulation, particularly in the long, flowing sentences that mirror wind and memory. Strong perceptual signature in musical/symphonic metaphors throughout ("notes on a staff," "conducting chaos into joy"). Slight register elevation in places ("mournfully eager drive," "crystallized") that occasionally distances from immediacy, though it suits the ghostly perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "autumn leaves danced like notes on a staff." Some overwriting in metaphor density ("twisted like veins," "whisper of the man," "specter") and occasional abstraction ("weight of things left unsaid," "shadowed grief"). The repeated "mournfully eager" works as pattern but borders on mannered. Information density is good but could be tighter in the middle transformation sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with the specific, absurd detail of a leaf blower conductor—this unusual combination feels both comic and poignant. The concept of using industrial yard equipment for symphonic art, then translating that into spectral healing, shows genuine originality. The "maceration" of grief through persistent gentle pressure offers a non-obvious approach to the haunting narrative.</comment>
