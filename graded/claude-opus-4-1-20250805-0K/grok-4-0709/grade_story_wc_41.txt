<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (chalk symbols, driftwood markers), with his precognitive forgetfulness creating genuine internal contradiction between vision and retention. The final moment of acceptance ("the longing would return, wave after wave") shows earned endurance with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("tidal longing surged within him").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently with density increase toward the hollow's discovery and sound-capture, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves temporary wholeness knowing its impermanence. Cost is legible in "the prophet felt whole" followed immediately by "Yet he knew the longing would return," though the piece could strengthen the price of this cyclical acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fog garden's sculptures and driftwood markers constrain Elias's navigation and enable his ritual mapping, with the hollow's "organic hum" charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("chalk scraped softly," "moist air"), and the setting actively guides choice through the fog's opacity requiring physical markers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elias moves from chalk symbols to driftwood paths to the hollow's discovery, with each action narrowing his search pattern. The vision that "vanished, leaving only an echo of sorrow" demonstrates cost, though the piece could heighten the stakes of failure or the price of his forgetting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of capturing impermanence—Elias seeks to hold "the sound of growing older" while accepting he cannot retain it. The final image of "chalk crumbling in his hand" while "sounds of time enveloped him" offers a non-literal answer about embracing transience, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("nexus," "veils between past and future").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fog-wreathed scrap metal," "videotapes dangled like fruit"), though occasional register elevation doesn't fully match a junkyard prophet's lexicon ("ephemeral shapes," "vaporous illusions"). The perceptual signature of noticing decay and transformation is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("chalk crumbling in his hand, as the sounds of time enveloped him like an old, familiar sea") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("tidal longing," "vaporous illusions") and some paraphrase loops ("visions flashed bright, then faded into oblivion, leaving him clinging to echoes" restates the forgetting). Filter verbs cluster in places ("he believed," "Elias's heart swelled") dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a prophet who forgets his visions offers fresh tension, and the fog sculpture garden as junkyard sanctuary creates specific texture. The synthesis of impermanence-seeking and acceptance feels earned, though some elements (videotapes, driftwood) could integrate more deeply into the prophet's specific practice.</comment>
