<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's meditative intensity and obsession with finding "the shape of collective grief" drives consistent character-specific choices, particularly in how he transforms from carving names to abstract patterns. The ghost mentor relationship creates genuine pressure that forces Elias to reconsider his craft. However, the emotional progression feels slightly managed, with the revelation about family poems arriving too neatly to resolve his search.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias shifts from static stone-carving to understanding grief as "woven, retraced, and shared," with visible cost in abandoning his previous methods. The ghost's mentorship creates coherent pressure that builds to the final realization about collective grief as "a woven, poetic storm." Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the ghost's appearance and wisdom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables choices—butterflies guide Elias's ribbon path, the enclosed space creates intimacy for spectral encounter, and the migration patterns directly inspire his new carving approach. Sensory details like "vines twisted like forgotten promises" and "air hummed with faint thunder" create atmospheric pressure. The setting functions as more than backdrop, becoming integral to Elias's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic frustration to understanding familial and collective grief patterns, with the ribbon-weaving and butterfly migration creating physical manifestation of abstract concepts. The ghost's mentorship applies consistent pressure that forces Elias to abandon his solitary approach. Cost is visible in his shift from individual names to abstract patterns, though the resolution feels slightly too harmonious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of butterflies' migration patterns mirroring grief's cyclical nature—"returning to roots unseen." The family tradition of trading poems provides specific grounding for abstract concepts. The final image of grief as "woven, poetic storm, eternal and shared" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"fiercely meditative," "thundering calm"—that supports the contemplative tone. The ghost's dialogue carries appropriate spectral authority without feeling forced. Some register elevation ("spectral mentorship to bridge the living and the dead") occasionally distances from Elias's craftsman perspective, creating minor POV friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("butterflies, their wings a silent storm of orange and black") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"thundering calm" appears three times, "fiercely meditative" twice. Several abstract constructions ("elusive form he believed hid in the world's shared sorrows") could be more concrete. The elevated register sometimes obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in philosophical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving with butterfly migration as metaphor for grief's patterns offers a fresh angle on mourning narratives. The family tradition of trading poems adds specific texture. However, the ghost-mentor device and the journey from confusion to clarity follow familiar templates without sufficient transformation to elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
