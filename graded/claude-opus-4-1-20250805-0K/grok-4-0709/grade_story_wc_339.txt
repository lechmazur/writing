I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is primarily an Accumulative/Textural piece with Causal elements, making it Hybrid but dominant in Accumulative at closure. The snow globe discovery accumulates meaning through untangling threads, building toward Elias's realization about letting go.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is consistently rooted in processing grief through analytical dissection, with concrete embodiment ("maneuvered his submersible's robotic arms"). The internal contradiction between seeking equations for grief and the emotional reality lands well. Minor deduction for "quietly analytic" appearing twice as a label rather than fully dramatized trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "letting go was not erasure, but equilibrium" with visible cost in powering down the lights and ascending. The accumulative build through wire untangling to revelation works under the textural lens. Deduction for slightly abstract final insight that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken library setting effectively constrains choices through submersible limitations and creates atmosphere ("cathedral of forgotten knowledge"). The snow globe's physical properties drive the untangling action. Minor deduction for some generic deep-sea descriptors ("eerie silence," "cold, pressure-sealed abyss").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding grief's physics, with escalation through discovering the globe, untangling wires, finding Earhart's transmission, then the note. Cost appears in "letting the library fade to shadow" as acceptance. The emotional stakes could pressure choices more directly rather than through discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the snow globe's "particles clinging, then drifting apart under invisible laws" mirroring grief's physics. The note's message about "surrender to gravity's pull" resonates without moralizing. Final image of "echoes teach us to drift free" reweights the opening without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent analytical register with selective perception ("his lights caught a glint"). Dialogue with "Mort" feels natural as internal conversation. Some register elevation in "cathedral of forgotten knowledge" and "sophisticated melancholy" slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon during action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is generally strong. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("elusive force binding souls"), some filter constructions ("he saw parallels"), and occasional overwriting ("hypnotic dance," "eerie silence").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Earhart's disappearance with personal grief through underwater archaeology offers fresh specificity. The snow globe as puzzle/transmission device transforms expected symbolism. The conversational relationship with Death as "Mort" adds distinctive texture without gimmickry.</comment>
