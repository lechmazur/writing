<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" drives consistent action through the letter chain and stone-stacking, with his personal losses (wife to fever, child to waves) providing concrete emotional grounding. The ghosts' transformation from aching spirits to peaceful forms shows earned change through his specific action. However, the emotional arithmetic feels slightly too neat when the spirits immediately calm upon touching the sea glass, lacking the messier contradictions of genuine crisis response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lamp's extinguishing precipitating the climactic action where Elias extends his letter chain to the spectral realm, achieving closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as the ghosts find peace. The cost is visible in "the luminescent ache soften into quiet resolve" and the ongoing burden of continuing the tradition. The orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, supply runs, Whispering Rock Isle) establish clearly by ~100 words, though the mystical elements take longer to cohere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's "glass walls etched with salt and sorrow" and the cairn communication system create specific atmosphere that constrains Elias's choices. The setting functions beyond description when "the darkness invited the lost souls to roam freely," forcing immediate action. However, the spatial choreography in the lantern room sequence could be clearer, and some sensory details feel catalogued rather than filtered through Elias's specific perception as a seasoned mariner.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining safety against the void—escalates when the lamp flickers out, forcing Elias to act under pressure with the ghosts intensifying. His choice to stack stones and place the letter represents agency that forecloses other options (like simply relighting the lamp). The cost appears in the ghosts' peaceful fading and Elias's ongoing commitment, though the resolution feels slightly convenient when the spirits immediately respond to the sea glass without resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of safety as something that must be actively maintained and passed on emerges through the letter chain tradition and crystallizes when Elias extends it to the spectral realm. The sea glass functions as more than ornament, literally bottling safety in tangible form. The final image of "stacking messages for whoever needed to bottle that precious safety next" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, though some thematic connections feel slightly over-determined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception ("warmly observant eyes missed nothing") and character-specific diction like "luminescent ache." The prose modulates appropriately during the ghost encounter, tightening syntax. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("encroaching dark," "ethereal glows") that doesn't fully align with a reticent skipper's lexicon, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("waves curled like secrets") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "luminescent ache" (appears 4 times) and some template cadence in the middle section. Several sentences could be cut without loss, particularly in the backstory passages. The filter-verb stack in "Elias had felt it himself" and "He could feel their luminescent ache" dulls immediacy during crucial beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse haunting with message-in-a-bottle tradition through stone cairns offers a fresh angle on familiar maritime ghost stories. The specific detail of coded stone stacking ("Three flat stones meant 'danger approaches'") transforms generic supernatural elements. The risk of extending human tradition to spectral beings pays off, though the resolution's tidiness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
