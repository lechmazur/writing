<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to analyze the sculpture's cracks as musical notation. The final choice to strum despite uncertainty shows earned agency with visible cost (tears, emotional release). However, internal conflict remains largely abstract ("empathy swelled") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than struggled toward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the strumming sequence building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes enriched rather than broken. Closure lands with emotional cost (tears) and the grove's transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening paragraphs. Deduction for the cost being primarily emotional/atmospheric rather than showing concrete forfeit or trade-off that alters future options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator and sculpture function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elara must decipher the cracks to unlock sound. Sensory detail effectively narrows from grove-wide to the intimate sculpture examination. The siskin alder grove provides atmospheric pressure through "intensely quiet" tone. Minor deduction for some generic nature imagery ("whispered secrets") early on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating music in silence) established early and deepens through discovering the sculpture holds the key. The strumming sequence shows meaningful escalation from "nothing happened" to "faint hum" to full resonance. Cost is visible in the emotional weight and the world's response. Slightly limited by lack of concrete opposition or trade-off beyond internal doubt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of analyzing fractures as musical notation—brokenness becoming the source of harmony. The ending offers resonant answer without stating moral: empathy flows through shared vibration rather than words. Strong integration of "empathy in motion" as both concept and lived experience. The tears and grove's response avoid sentimentality through specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. "Symphonically minded" characterization shapes perception effectively. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tender moment when dawn coaxed") that doesn't fully match Elara's embodied perspective, and some filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt") dull immediacy during key discovery moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure supporting the contemplative pace. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Significant deductions for repetitive phrasing around "empathy in motion" (appears 4 times), some template constructions ("She wandered," "She studied," "She positioned"), and occasional overwriting ("spiderwebbed from the center, like crescendo lines in a symphony building to a peak").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of reading cracks as musical notation offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic silence. Specific synthesis of porcelain insulator's industrial past with artistic present shows originality. However, the "healer-artist restores lost beauty" arc follows familiar template without significant transformation, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>
