I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his promise to Mira, with concrete embodied emotion ("volcanic tenderness" manifested through trembling fingers, quiet sobs). The "analytically intuitive" trait drives specific actions (decoding chisel marks, recognizing patterns). Internal contradiction appears when his arsonist guilt confronts his guardian role, earning the final transformation. Deduction for some label-speak ("analytically intuitive" repeated without variation) and slight emotional tidiness in resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (relief→mosaic→portrait→tapestry) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from destroyer to guardian. Cost is visible in his tears and the weight of carrying Mira's lineage forward. The trail of artistic creations provides strong causality within the accumulative structure. Minor deduction for slightly convenient alignment of all clues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices through its labyrinthine structure and hidden alcoves, with sensory detail ("crumbling stone corridors," "dim halls"). The vandalized portrait's physical details (slashed canvas, gouged eyes) directly enable discovery of the tapestry. Setting functions as more than backdrop, actively shaping Elias's path. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("shadowed depths," "ancient echoes").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through artistic discoveries that deepen Elias's connection to his promise, with each creation raising emotional cost. The vandalized portrait forces confrontation with his arsonist identity ("mirroring his own arsonist's guilt"). Final stakes crystallize when he must recreate the tapestry to honor Mira. One meaningful deepening achieved through accumulation, though physical danger is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus destruction emerges organically through Elias's journey from arsonist to guardian. The final image of transformation ("arsonist's fire transformed into a guardian's warmth") offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through the artistic trail and vandalized portrait. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "burn the false to reveal the true."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the reflective, quest-like tone. Perceptual signature shows in how Elias analyzes artistic details ("chisel marks," "methodical cuts"). Some filter verb clusters ("he sensed," "he found," "he discovered") dull immediacy. Prose occasionally drifts toward purple ("volcanic tenderness, a simmering passion beneath his calm exterior").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("volcanic tenderness"/"tender as lava," repeated "forgotten promise"). Template cadence in discovery sequence ("First, he found...There, a mosaic...he arrived at"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("heart stirred with volcanic tenderness, a simmering passion beneath his calm exterior, tender as lava cooling into fertile earth"). Information density could be higher; some sentences merely elaborate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait as deliberate message rather than random destruction offers fresh angle. Transformation of arsonist-as-destroyer to arsonist-as-revealer provides non-obvious synthesis. The artistic trail leading to hidden knowledge feels somewhat familiar in adventure/quest stories. Specific detail in the tapestry recreation scene elevates beyond pure template.</comment>
