<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore lost faith is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene—we're told about her skepticism eroding "like wind on stone" rather than seeing it act through micro-choices. The "warmly curious" trait manifests in surface gestures (touching root-wrapped ribcages) without creating meaningful cost or constraint. Character change from skeptic to believer happens too smoothly without genuine struggle or blind spots driving mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around the excavation, but closure lacks visible cost—faith "blooms" without sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The sundial assembly provides a symbolic resolution but doesn't create a true Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. Causality is present but mechanical: dig → find scrolls → read → faith restored, missing the pressure that would force stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is vivid with strong sensory detail ("sweet rot of fallen fruit mingling with earthy scent of decay") and the environment does constrain choices through root entanglement. However, the setting doesn't charge the final image sufficiently—the orchard could be any mystical burial ground without altering the restoration arc. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the three-day excavation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"restore lost faith" never faces concrete tests or trade-offs. The excavation proceeds without meaningful opposition; "cautious enchantment" creates atmosphere but no actual pressure that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara simply digs progressively deeper and finds what she seeks without cost or competing goods to choose between.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and restoration emerges through repetition but resolves into tidy completion without complexity. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("faith blooming like the trees amid the bones") rather than letting it emerge from the final image. The sundial metaphor is transparent allegory without surprising resonance. Missing counter-readings or genuine ambiguity that would create lasting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with controlled diction appropriate to literary fantasy, but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices what any returnee might notice. Prose modulates slightly with discovery moments but doesn't reflect stress or internal texture changes. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative stance remains stable but generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose suffers from template cadence ("She began... She sat... She swore...") and paraphrase loops, particularly around the faith/restoration concept repeated in different phrasings. Overwriting appears in mixed metaphors ("roots snaked between bones, twisting through skulls and femurs like veins of life"). Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar content about interrupted journeys. The filter-verb stack ("she recalled... wondering... imagining") dulls immediacy in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard concept offers visual interest but executes familiar return-home-to-find-faith territory without transformation. The sundial-as-faith metaphor is serviceable but obvious. Story follows safe middle choices, avoiding risk in favor of atmospheric description. The excavation framework provides structure but doesn't yield surprising discoveries or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
