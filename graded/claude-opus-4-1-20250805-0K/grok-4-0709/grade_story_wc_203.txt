<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives consistent choices through dust analysis to freeing ghosts, with his parents' death providing earned backstory that anchors his gift. The ghosts manifest distinct personalities through gesture (ringmaster pointing, juggler tossing), though their emotional states could be more embodied. The final choice to wind the mainspring counterclockwise shows clear agency with visible cost (the weightless burden lifting).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias frees the ghosts by reversing the mainspring, with visible cost in "luminous wisps that ascended through the ceiling cracks." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as atmospheric details build toward this release. Orientation anchors clearly (circus, ticket office, Elias as technician), and the horologist's enchantment provides solid causality for the ghosts' binding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting constrains choices effectively—dust patterns on ceiling panels provide the crucial discovery method, and the "decrepit freight elevator" draws Elias to this specific location. Sensory detail is selective ("fluorescent lights buzzed erratically," "stale air"), though could deepen during peak moments. The mainspring barrel's "brass surface etched with circus motifs" integrates object with setting purposefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating an anonymous call to discovering trapped souls to freeing them, with the mainspring barrel creating a concrete mechanism for resolution. The "weightless burden" intensifies as ghosts multiply, forcing Elias's choice to engage. Cost is visible when spirits dissolve into "luminous wisps," though the personal price to Elias beyond relief could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "ceilings hide" secrets/spirits, with the horologist's enchantment representing artificial preservation versus natural endings. The "cracks in the façade" motif links physical deterioration to spiritual imprisonment effectively. The final image of ghosts ascending "through the ceiling cracks" resonates without stating a moral, though the "fragile threads of forgotten lives" edges toward explicit summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance and clean free indirect style ("Elias knew better"). Perceptual signature shows in his technical attention to "dust accumulation patterns" and structural anomalies. Some filter verbs could be cut ("Elias felt the familiar weightless burden"), and occasional elevated diction ("ethereal heaviness that pressed without mass") slightly strains the technician POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts (short during ghost manifestation, longer during discovery). However, several instances of overwriting appear: "ethereal heaviness that pressed without mass, like regrets carried on a breeze" strains the metaphor, and "fragile threads of forgotten lives" in the final line tends toward abstraction. Some filter verbs ("Elias felt," "he noticed") dull immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator technician with ghost-sight creates fresh specificity, avoiding generic paranormal investigation. The horologist's mainspring barrel as a soul-trapping device offers an inventive mechanism that feels earned within the circus context. The "weightless burden" and dust analysis method show particular ingenuity, though the resolution mechanism (winding counterclockwise) feels slightly convenient.</comment>
