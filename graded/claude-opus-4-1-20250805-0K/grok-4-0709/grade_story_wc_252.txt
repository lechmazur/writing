<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's yearning for freedom and Marek's fear of loss create genuine contradictory impulses that act in scene, particularly in their dock confrontation. The transformation into a sea creature feels somewhat abrupt without sufficient embodied foreshadowing, though the scrimshaw's power to unlock hearts provides partial causality. The final choice carries visible cost in Marek's abandonment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the whale's call and disappearing island creating a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The transformation carries felt cost through Marek's loss, though the shift from human to creature needed stronger grounding earlier. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words in the sublittoral fringe setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as more than backdrop—the liminal space between land and sea mirrors Elara's internal conflict and enables her transformation. Sensory details like "water lapping at her ankles like an invitation" and the whale's vibrating call create vivid embodiment. The setting directly constrains choice and charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of freedom versus connection escalates through the scrimshaw's emotional unlocking and culminates in the whale's call. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as Elara's true nature emerges, forcing the trade-off between love and authenticity. Cost is legible in Marek's acceptance of loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of authentic self versus imposed peace emerges through concrete particulars—the scrimshaw unlocking hearts, the impossible violence backdrop, the sea's persistent call. The final transformation offers a non-literal answer about freedom's price without moralizing. "Combative tenderness" effectively captures the push-pull dynamic throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "grace of a current weaving through kelp" that match Elara's fluid nature. Dialogue carries authentic subtext in exchanges like "You chain yourself to this dock" with natural indirection. The perceptual signature stays focused on water imagery and movement throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful water imagery, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("tempests and hidden coves," "emerald and mist"). Template phrases appear ("It was said," "Whispers among the dock folk spoke") that could be tightened. The transformation sequence maintains momentum despite occasional density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The post-violence world where "fists unclenched into open palms" provides fresh context for conflict. The scrimshaw as emotional key and the human-to-sea-creature transformation avoid pure template, though the yearning-for-the-sea trope is familiar. The "combative tenderness" dynamic between lovers offers specificity.</comment>
