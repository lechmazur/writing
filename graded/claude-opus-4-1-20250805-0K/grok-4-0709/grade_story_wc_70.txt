<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thorne's involuntary truthfulness drives the reveal that enables Elara's quest, with his motivation to "preserve wonder in routine" manifesting through action rather than declaration. The truthfulness creates genuine constraint—he cannot withhold the drone failure's cause or the lacquer box's existence—though Elara remains somewhat passive as recipient rather than agent of discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the lacquer box releases "preserved wonder" to revive the drones and restore power, with the cost being the city's over-reliance that "drained the box's magic." The causal chain holds: blackout → Elara seeks answers → Thorne's truthfulness forces revelation → riddle guides to solution → wonder restored. Orientation anchors early with "amber glow of nectar dusk" establishing when/where, though the piece leans heavily on exposition through Thorne's forced explanations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower as beehive with "hexagonal cells that harvested storm energy" creates a unique world where nature and technology merge, constraining the solution to restoring the drone-hive's "rhythm." The lacquer box's placement "at the apex, amid dormant cells" and its honey-like gleaming surface integrate setting with resolution, while "nectar dusk" suffuses atmosphere throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes establish clearly—city-wide blackout threatens routine life—and escalate through the riddle's challenge to find and activate the lacquer box. However, Elara faces minimal opposition; the riddle solves easily and the box works immediately upon opening. Cost exists conceptually (over-reliance drained wonder) but lacks immediate dramatic pressure or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of preserving "wonder in routine" emerges through the bio-tech hive system and Thorne's mission to remind people "magic hid in the mundane." The lacquer box storing "pure wonder, essence distilled from lightning and nectar" literalizes this theme, though the ending stating "routine resumed—but now, laced with enduring awe" edges toward explicit moralizing rather than letting the image resonate alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated fantasy register ("amber glow of nectar dusk," "honeyed light") that matches the world's blend of nature and technology. Thorne's dialogue carries his constraint naturally ("Drone beehive failure, that's why"), though Elara's interiority tends toward exposition ("picturing the tower's inner workings") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "her lantern flickering like a trapped firefly" and maintains the honey/nectar motif throughout. However, several passages slide into pure exposition ("vast chambers buzzing with bio-luminescent drones, their wings sparking with captured bolts") and the riddle's interpretation feels mechanically explained rather than discovered. Some filter-heavy constructions ("she felt the weight") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a lightning-harvesting beehive tower powered by engineered drones offers fresh synthesis of nature and technology, with the specific failure mode (drones abandoning the queen) arising organically from the hybrid system. The lacquer box storing "pure wonder" as literal magical essence provides an inventive solution, though the resolution's ease prevents higher distinction.</comment>
