<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's transformation from clinical detachment to acceptance is earned through concrete observation of the butterfly dust's decay patterns, with her final choice to clear the decay "not with frustration, but acceptance" showing genuine cost. The internal contradiction between her need for control and the flood's chaos drives authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("kindled humility," "strip needless drama").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as dust patterns gradually transform the greenhouse and Elena's perspective, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts rather than resists entropy. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the butterfly dust accumulation creates coherent pressure toward Elena's shifted stance, though the cost could be more visceral at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both setting and metaphor, with butterfly dust patterns constraining Elena's choices and forcing her confrontation with uncontrollable decay. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("iridescent powder," "mild acids," "etched into plant tissues"), and the environment's transformation directly shapes the final image of acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena's need to control versus accepting entropy—deepens through accumulating dust patterns that force her from observation to intervention. The tightening occurs when decay threatens the orchids and trellis, though agency remains primarily observational until the final clearing action, limiting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between neutron star decay and greenhouse dissolution, with the butterfly dust serving as a concrete vehicle for exploring control versus acceptance. The final image of Elena clearing decay "with acceptance" offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though phrases like "kindled humility" occasionally state rather than embody the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through Elena's POV ("preprocessing reality," "intricate models"), with perceptual signature evident in how she notices patterns and fractals. Some register drift occurs in emotional peaks ("unfamiliar tug," "gentle flame eroding her detachment") that doesn't fully match the established clinical voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the dust accumulation sequences that merge action and meaning. Minor template cadence appears in "Elena + verb" constructions across several paragraphs, and some paraphrase loops occur around the preprocessing concept, though clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics research with greenhouse decay offers a fresh angle on entropy acceptance, with butterfly wing dust as an unexpected vehicle for transformation. The parallel between cosmic and intimate scales feels earned through specific detail, though the resolution toward acceptance follows a somewhat predictable arc.</comment>
