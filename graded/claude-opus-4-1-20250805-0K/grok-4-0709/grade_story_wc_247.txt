<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from forgotten composer to rediscovering music through mapped silence shows clear motivation with embodied melancholy ("ghost haunting his own memories"). The joyful sorrow at closure lands with earned cost, though Thorne's characterization relies heavily on "quietly charismatic" labeling rather than demonstrated complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms silence into music, with visible cost in years of "muted creativity" now reclaimed. Accumulative lens holds as silence patterns build toward musical breakthrough. Orientation anchors clearly (harbor, moonlight, Elias) though Thorne's sudden appearance lacks causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Luminous harbor setting creates atmospheric pressure with "liquid silver" water and "ethereal light," though it functions more as backdrop than constraint. The vintage camera serves as micro-setting that enables the mapping method. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Central stake of artistic redemption through silence escalates as Elias progresses from passive wandering to active composition. The mapping method provides meaningful deepening that transforms his relationship to silence. Cost is visible in the "years of muted creativity" though the resolution feels somewhat swift for the established melancholy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of finding art in absence emerges organically through the silence-mapping conceit, avoiding explicit moralizing. The empty camera chamber metaphor resonates with creative void, and the final image of "signs of their shared creation lingering in the air" offers non-literal closure that reweights prior emptiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent melancholic register with moments of lyricism ("liquid silver," "ghost haunting"), though lacks distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue exists only in whispers and sign language, creating interesting texture. Some register elevation ("ethereal," "cartographer") slightly exceeds established POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive "quietly charismatic" (3x) and template constructions ("Elias began," "Thorne watched," "Elias lowered"). Several paraphrase loops diminish momentum ("mapping silence"/"charting the pauses"). Information density is moderate with some evocative imagery but frequent scaffolding phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The silence-mapping concept offers fresh angle on artistic inspiration, transforming expected musical creation story. Specific detail like "diagrams of quiet intervals" adds originality. However, the whispering advisor archetype and redemption arc follow familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
