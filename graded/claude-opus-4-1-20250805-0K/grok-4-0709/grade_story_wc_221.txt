I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory details, temporal distortions, and pattern accumulation toward a revelation that reweights Elara's isolation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (sketching, exploring), with good internal consistency. The "blessed pariah" paradox creates genuine character tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around her temporal gift that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovery transforms isolation into purpose, with visible cost (her outcast status). The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering and pattern building. Slight weakness in the middle section's causality between sketching and revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid setting with time dilation effects constraining perception and choice. The derelict station's atmosphere effectively pressures the character. The compass rose and viewport work as micro-settings that enable the key discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in isolation) builds through accumulative pressure toward the nebula discovery. The revelation genuinely transforms her options. Cost is present but could be more viscerally felt in the moment of discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the true north concept and family tradition, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the pariah's blessing becoming strength resonates without stating the theme. Strong integration of isolation/connection paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signature around temporal flows. Good modulation between reflection and action. Some filter verb clusters ("she felt," "she could feel") in middle section reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate. Deductions for repetitive "echoed silence" phrase (4 uses), some template cadence in middle paragraphs, and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The temporal perception gift and time-dilated setting offer fresh angles. The synthesis of family tradition with space station isolation feels organic. Transformation of the compass rose from earthly to stellar navigation shows ingenuity.</comment>
