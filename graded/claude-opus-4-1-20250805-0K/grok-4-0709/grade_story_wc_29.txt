I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority ("hands trembled slightly") and embodied stress. However, the internal conflict lacks simultaneity—her cautious hope and wariness alternate rather than clash in scene. The resolution feels somewhat convenient; her counter-frequency solution works too smoothly without genuine struggle or meaningful cost beyond vigilance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (discovers trickster signals → develops counter-frequencies → broadcasts disruption). However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara succeeds without sacrifice, loss, or meaningful change to her situation. The "quiet victory" and continued vigilance don't constitute a Decisive Change or carry the required felt cost for proper closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radio station setting is vivid and constraining—"outdated equipment," "antenna tower piercing the night sky," sensory details of "stale coffee and ozone." The basement location and graffiti-scarred walls create atmosphere while the technical equipment enables her solution. Setting actively shapes her tactics through the available technology.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing community violence) is clear, but escalation is minimal—Elara simply executes her plan without meaningful obstacles or reversals. The tricksters never adapt or counter-strike; they just "recoil" and retreat. No genuine tightening occurs; the resolution arrives through straightforward technical competence without forcing difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of human agency versus cosmic manipulation emerges through action, avoiding direct moralizing. The trickster concept offers complexity—entities harvesting emotional energy through division. However, the resolution is too tidy; Elara's success doesn't interrogate the theme's implications about vulnerability or the cost of constant vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic-tinged narration appropriate to Elara's role, with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows through technical focus ("subsonic frequencies," "vector"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal grit," "inscrutable games") that feels forced rather than organic to the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "defiant needle," "ethereal beings of light and shadow," and abstract phrases like "quiet victory in this ethereal game of cosmic chess." Some repetitive phrasing ("power plays" appears 6 times) creates mild redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cosmic trickster premise offers a fresh angle on community division, combining sci-fi elements with social commentary. The subsonic frequency solution is specific and grounded. However, the execution plays safe—the protagonist succeeds without meaningful complication, and the tricksters remain abstract rather than genuinely alien or surprising.</comment>
