<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through ancestral debt and the ghost bride's lovingly venomous presence creates consistent pressure, with embodied reactions to her appearances ("heart ached with that mournful elation"). The final choice to accept both renewal and loss shows earned cost, though internal conflict could act more simultaneously rather than sequentially across her visits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant awakenings building through ephemeral visits toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "debts honored and souls entwined" transforms the greenhouse and fields. Cost is visible in Elias's depleted strength ("her visits sapped his strength") and the permanent loss of the bride, though the final transformation feels slightly unearned given the pattern of brief appearances.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse with "glass panes fogged with the breath of enchanted fruits" and "winter-cracked fields" under "endless night" creates atmospheric pressure that shapes choices. The setting transforms meaningfully through resonant awakenings, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("vines twisted like forgotten spells").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating visits that progressively awaken the orchard while draining Elias, with visible cost in "her loving venom seeping into his veins." The tension between healing the land and losing himself provides pressure, though individual visits lack distinct escalation beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of debt and sacrifice across lifetimes emerges through concrete actions—each ghostly visit both heals and harms, embodying the "mournful elation" of love's cost. The final image of "a beacon in the thawing hush" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward explicit theme ("debts unpaid across lifetimes").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains gothic atmosphere with controlled diction ("ephemeral cameo," "lovingly venomous"), though some passages drift into elevated register beyond POV plausibility ("karmic imbalance that kept her tethered"). Perceptual signature weakens during peak moments with generic phrasing like "heart ached."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("she ghosted" appears multiple times) and ornamental metaphors that don't advance pressure ("eyes like shadowed embers"). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions across visits, though the final transformation lands with clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ghost bride as debt-repayer across lifetimes offers a fresh angle on supernatural romance, with "lovingly venomous" capturing genuine complexity. However, the alchemical greenhouse and endless night feel somewhat generic fantasy, lacking the specific lived detail that would elevate the concept.</comment>
