<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" creates a compelling internal drive that culminates in her discovering Silas's burden mirrors her own. The character shows genuine struggle with inherited legacy, though the epiphanic resolution ("the burden of her legacy lightened") arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient embodied cost in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through echoes, diaries, and the film negative toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reframes her burden as "a shared narrative to rewrite." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—the line "the burden of her legacy lightened" tells rather than showing through embodied action or concrete sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as more than backdrop—the thick foliage muffles sound, forces physical struggle ("forcing her to squeeze through tangles"), and preserves the forgotten study. The sensory work ("thick with the scent of decay and salt") and spatial choreography remain consistent, with the environment actively constraining Elara's movements and discoveries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering truth to lighten inherited burden—remains consistent but escalation is modest. The discovery of diaries and film negative deepens understanding but doesn't force a costly choice; Elara's vow to "chart not just echoes, but redemptions" lacks concrete opposition or sacrifice that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of inherited burden and shared narrative emerges organically through Silas's parallel struggle with "the legacy of denial that accelerated the world's unraveling." The walls' dreams metaphor works as accumulated regrets rather than fantasies, though the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("a shared narrative to rewrite") edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception ("sensitively perceptive, attuned to the faintest vibrations") and profession-specific focus on echoes and resonances. Some elevated diction ("verdant shroud," "singed envelope") fits the literary tone, though phrases like "heartquickened" and occasional filter verbs ("she noticed," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows strong atmospheric control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "legacy's burden" appears multiple times without variation, "burdened by the legacy of denial" relies on nominalization, and the final paragraph contains conceptual loops ("chart not just echoes, but redemptions, turning the past's burdens into guides").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer profession offers a fresh angle on post-climate exploration, and the concept of mapping whispers in ruins shows originality. The integration of climate collapse with personal archaeological discovery avoids typical dystopian tropes, though the resolution toward redemptive rewriting feels somewhat safe rather than bold.</comment>
