<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's prosopagnosia creates a compelling lens for investigation, and his methodical approach reveals character through specific action. The awakening of dormant empathy provides a clear arc with visible cost. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed in the final beats, and Jane Doe/Lila remains more concept than character, limiting relational complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from ribbon discovery through investigation to closure/memorial, with Elias's empathy awakening as the decisive change. The closure lands with emotional cost as Elias connects with another's isolation. However, the resolution feels convenient—the ribbon too easily yields Lila's identity, and the leap from portrait to family finding closure lacks dramatized causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry's mist and shadowed depths effectively mirror the mystery's opacity, with sensory details like "drip of condensation" grounding the atmosphere. The contrast between opulent masquerade and desolate quarry creates productive tension. The studio space remains somewhat generic, missing opportunities to reflect Elias's unique perceptual world through spatial detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the cold case to awaken empathy—progresses through investigation beats, with the ribbon discovery tightening focus. The internal conflict between detachment and connection provides pressure. However, escalation remains mostly intellectual rather than visceral, and the lack of active opposition or time pressure limits urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of seeing beyond surfaces resonates through Elias's face blindness and the masked victim, with "unifying opposites" working as both method and thematic principle. The final image of connections forged in shadow offers resonance. Yet the theme sometimes announces itself too directly ("unifying the factual with the emotional"), reducing subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and employs specific diction like "calipers, grids" that reflects Elias's methodical nature. POV control holds steady throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("dormant empathy he scarcely acknowledged, buried under layers"), and some passages read as exposition rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Several passages suffer from abstract telling and repetitive phrasing ("methodical/methodically" appears multiple times, "dormant empathy" repeats). Lines like "unification of opposites: the chaos of decay with the order of art" explain rather than embody. The prose achieves moments of clarity but accumulates enough scaffolding and conceptual redundancy to impede momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise of a face-blind portrait artist investigating a masked victim offers genuine originality, creating natural thematic resonance. The specific synthesis of prosopagnosia with forensic art feels fresh. However, the execution relies on some familiar cold case conventions, and the resolution's tidiness undermines the conceptual boldness.</comment>
