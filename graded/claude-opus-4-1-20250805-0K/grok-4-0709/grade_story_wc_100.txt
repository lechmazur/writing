I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and inadvertent stubbornness manifest through embodied details like "bent like a drowned willow" and his refusal to leave until souls find peace. His motivation crystallizes from exhaustion to resolve when the lens arrives, driving meaningful choices. The character arc from passive undertaker to active guide lands with visible cost in his final exhaustion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through ghostly manifestations building to the transformation sequence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the library transforms from "tomb of turmoil" to "serene repository," with Elias's exhaustion as visible cost. The orientation anchors (underwater city, library, Elias as undertaker) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater library setting constrains every choice through "pressurized silence," "waterlogged corridors," and "impossible spaces" that Elias must navigate. Bioluminescent algae and the domed glass ceiling create atmospheric pressure while the broken lens enables access to metaphysical spaces. The setting literally shapes the resolution method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal exhaustion to collective spiritual unrest, with the lens discovery triggering active engagement. The "impossible spaces" sequence raises cost as Elias risks being pulled into memory whirlpools. His stubbornness driving him into "tighter voids" shows agency under pressure with clear trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of unrest into rest, with the library's dual nature as tomb/repository embodying the central question. The final image of "unchased peace" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "chased stillness." Specific ghosts (scholar, lover) avoid abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphors ("bent like a drowned willow," "echoes in a cavern"). Some elevated diction ("ethereal archives," "metaphysical wards") occasionally strains the undertaker's POV. Perceptual signature strong in how Elias notices decay and spiritual manifestations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("dim, watery glow," "pressurized silence"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("He'd stared...He'd ignored..."). Strong opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively. Some filter constructions ("felt his inadvertent stubbornness") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The underwater library housing restless spirits offers fresh specificity, while "impossible spaces" as metaphysical architecture provides non-obvious world logic. The transformation from distress signals to permanent addresses shows conceptual integrity. Some familiar ghost-laying tropes prevent higher scoring.</comment>
