Looking at this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive (evident from its lyric quality and pattern-based resolution), I'll evaluate each category:

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "understand the mathematics of emotion" drives consistent action through the ritual, with embodied grief in clutching the glass eyes. The final vision provides earned closure through accumulated detail rather than dramatic reversal. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("ambiguous loss," "buried optimism") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the vision of Mira "stepping through a veil" that reweights the ambiguous loss with possibility rather than finality. The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through ritual detail and memory. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"knowing his invention had bridged the unbridgeable" lacks the visceral price that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with its dripping stalactites and mosaic stone creates a vivid, constraining environment that shapes the ritual's execution. Sensory detail effectively filters through Elias's perception ("twisted trees," "luminescent fruit"). The setting actively participates in closure through the moonlight-glass eye-mosaic interaction that enables the vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elias's need for closure about Mira's fate, with escalation through the ritual's progression from placement to vision. The deepening occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat—the vision provides exactly what he seeks without meaningful trade-off or unexpected cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between mathematical certainty and emotional ambiguity, culminating in "possibility, of loss that was not absolute." The taxidermist eyes breathing "false life" resonates with the uncertain nature of the vision. Slight deduction for the explicit statement about "mathematics of emotion" that could trust the imagery more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("secretive conjurer," "tiny architect sculpting the stone"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for this reflective mode. Some elevated diction ("dovetail," "incantations") fits the conjurer's perspective without breaking character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ceaseless drip," "gentle invention," "ambiguous loss" in close succession). Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. Template cadence appears briefly ("Elias, a man of..." "His life was one of...") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, magic, and mathematical logic offers a fresh angle on loss narratives. The specific detail of using taxidermist eyes in a mathematical-magical ritual feels original. However, the resolution toward "buried optimism" and finding hope through ambiguity follows somewhat predictable emotional paths for this type of story.</comment>
