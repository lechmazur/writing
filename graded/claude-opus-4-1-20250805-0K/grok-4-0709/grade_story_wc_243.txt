I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve ephemeral moments is clear and consistent, driving his ritual at the jetty. The internal progression from grief to "haunted euphoria" shows genuine emotional complexity. However, the transformation relies heavily on abstract descriptions ("spectral whispers," "ghostly presence") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene, and Mira remains more symbol than person.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the ritual's completion. However, the closure—Elias feeling Mira's presence after steeping her photo—lacks visible cost beyond what was already established (her death). The "regeneration" of their covenant happens through assertion ("feeling her hand brush his") rather than a decisive change with new stakes or genuine reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight creates a vivid, sensory-rich environment that actively participates in the ritual through "salt spray mingled with floral scents." The walnut ink's "earthy and bittersweet" aroma effectively bridges past and present. Setting details like the "weathered planks" and "wild sea roses" ground the mystical elements in physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story establishes the stake of preserving memory early and builds pressure through the ritual's steps. However, there's no meaningful opposition or tightening—Elias performs each step without obstacle or cost, and the "haunted euphoria" arrives without earned resistance. The ritual succeeds too smoothly, lacking the friction that would make the closure feel consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving ephemeral moments emerges through concrete action (the steeping ritual) rather than assertion. The walnut ink serves as an effective motif linking past and present. However, the resolution toward "haunted bliss" and spiritual reunion feels unearned, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would deepen the meditation on memory and loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled diction ("bruised purples," "ephemeral"). Some passages achieve genuine texture through specific sensory details. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elias as archivist doesn't fundamentally shape how he notices or describes, and elevated phrases like "spectral whispers" feel more writerly than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Several passages suffer from overwriting: "haunted euphoria—a joyous ache laced with spectral whispers" piles abstractions without advancing the scene. Template structures appear ("First, he uncorked..." "As he lowered...") creating mechanical progression. The prose reaches for literary effect through density of figurative language but often obscures rather than clarifies the actual events.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of an archivist using walnut ink to commune with the dead offers a fresh angle on grief narratives. The specific ritual of steeping a photograph creates original imagery. However, the resolution into straightforward spiritual reunion ("feeling her hand brush his") retreats to familiar territory rather than following the premise's more complex implications about memory and preservation.</comment>
