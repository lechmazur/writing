<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from manipulative calligrapher to truth-seeking puppeteer is earned through the argument's catalyst, with concrete embodiment in his handling of the story stick and puppet prototype. The internal shift feels genuine but the epiphanic language ("half-lit epiphanies flickered") tends toward abstraction rather than embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias reverses his artistic practice from deception to truth-telling, with visible cost in losing Lena and abandoning profitable work. The causal chain from argument to reflection to new purpose holds, though the transformation happens entirely in reflection without present-scene testing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radar dome setting is vivid with "geodesic panels filtering moonlight into fractured patterns" and the acoustic properties amplifying puppet movements. However, the environment doesn't actively constrain choices beyond providing atmosphere; the seedy bars exist only in Elias's imagination rather than being dramatized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether art can serve truth rather than manipulation—is clear and tightens through Elias's reversal decision. Cost is visible in losing Lena and abandoning lucrative deception, but escalation happens through internal reflection rather than present-scene pressure testing his new commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between deceptive calligraphy and subversive truth-telling puppetry, with the story stick bridging both worlds. The ending's image of Elias planning "scripts that challenged power structures" offers a non-literal answer to the ethical storytelling question, though some thematic statements feel overly explicit ("could subversion heal the wounds of deceit").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains elegant, literary consistency with phrases like "meteor hush" and "fractured patterns," though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geodesic panels," "ethical explorations") that feels slightly removed from embodied experience. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is distinct in noticing ink stains and shadow patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and sophisticated vocabulary, but suffers from abstraction loops ("half-lit epiphanies," "partial revelations glowing dimly") and repetitive conceptual phrasing around ethics and reversal. Several passages restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle reflection sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fusion of calligraphy artist with puppet theater subversion offers a fresh angle on artistic integrity, particularly the specific image of using a campfire story stick to animate dome-scrap marionettes. The ethical exploration feels somewhat familiar but gains specificity through the concrete details of seedy bar performances.</comment>
