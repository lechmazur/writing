I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" drives consistent action through guerrilla gardening, with his guilt about the palace's decay providing internal conflict. The character's "heuristically gentle" approach creates genuine constraint in his methods. However, the emotional progression relies on telling phrases like "Absolution felt tenuous" rather than embodied contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias uncovering the mosaic and transforming the courtyard, with visible cost in his confrontation of personal guilt. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of "secret warmth" against winter. Causality tracks cleanly from tea house establishment through guerrilla gardening to the mosaic discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard functions as more than backdrop—vines "strangling" statues and the hidden mosaic discovery make setting instrumental to closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("chamomile from a chipped cup," bread's "faint yeast"). The tea house as micro-setting constrains access and creates sanctuary, though some descriptions lean generic ("leaves rustling like whispers").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming "normalized neglect" through uncloaking hidden beauty, with Elias's personal absolution as secondary pressure. The mosaic discovery provides meaningful escalation that forces confrontation with his guilt. However, the resolution lacks immediate opposition—the transformation happens without resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between decay and renewal, with the bread from the vanished bakery serving as tangible symbol of loss feeding new growth. The final image of "secret warmth" in winter resonates without stating a moral. The concept of finding "sacred in the ordinary" integrates naturally through guerrilla gardening acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "heuristically gentle" and "creeping normality" establishing distinct diction. POV remains stable in close third. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("normalized wilderness that visitors romanticized") that strains against the intimate scale, and filter phrases accumulate ("he felt," "he watched").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstraction loops and telling phrases: "Absolution felt tenuous, a fragile pardon he chased but never fully grasped, like mist slipping through fingers" restates the same idea three ways. Template constructions appear ("He had watched," "He'd achieve," "He stepped out"). Several sentences could be cut without loss, particularly the redundant philosophical statements about normalcy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The guerrilla gardening concept offers a fresh angle on restoration narrative, and the mosaic discovery provides genuine surprise. However, the execution relies on familiar beats of hidden beauty revealed and redemption through gardening. The specific detail of bread from a vanished bakery feeding new growth shows originality in synthesis.</comment>
