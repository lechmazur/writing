I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of descriptive detail and metaphorical weight toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara finds renewal through interpreting cosmic signals.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions of climbing, tuning, and interpreting. The philosophy of "finding beginnings in endings" earned through mentor's loss provides consistent drive. However, internal contradiction lacks scene-level tension—she moves with too much certainty for someone seeking personal answers, missing the embodied struggle that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when visions reveal the tower city's dormancy as potential rebirth, reweighting Elara's loss as beginning. The accumulative lens holds through layered imagery building to this revelation. Cost appears in "the loss forging her into a better interpreter" but feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally paid on-page, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned tower city suspended over the gorge creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere—"rusted spires clawed at the sky" effectively merges decay with reaching. The setting actively shapes choices through height creating "natural echo chamber" and the gorge's winds carrying signals. Sensory detail integrates action: "boots scraping against corroded metal" grounds movement in texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding renewal in endings—is signaled early and tested through the tuning sequence. Escalation occurs through methodical discarding of assumptions that brightens the fragment's response. However, the resolution arrives too easily through visions without meaningful resistance or trade-off, lacking the foreclosed option that would demonstrate true cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between city's abandonment/dormancy and Elara's loss/growth, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "shard of hush" as weighted silence holding unspoken stories enriches the thematic texture. The ending reweights prior material effectively, though the insight "loss forging her into a better interpreter" edges toward abstraction rather than earned specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent register blending technical ("celestial signal interpreter") with poetic ("whispers of stars"). Perceptual signature strong in how Elara notices cosmic patterns in mundane decay. Some register drift occurs with "methodically letting go of preconceived notions" which reads more clinical than the established lyrical tone, creating minor friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery—"moon hung swollen and insistent, pulling tides and tempers alike" compresses multiple tensions effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "endings hid seeds of renewal"/"turning loss into a practical quest for hidden starts" restate without advancement. Filter verb stack in vision sequence ("she saw") dulls immediacy at a crucial moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of "shard of hush"—silence as canvas holding unspoken stories—offers fresh angle on signal interpretation. Combining cosmic signal reading with practical tools ("pragmatic blend of ancient runes and salvaged tech") creates non-obvious synthesis. The Hollywood star fragment as amplifier shows originality, though execution occasionally relies on familiar "abandoned city" atmosphere.</comment>
