<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to negotiate with her ghost-self is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in turning the camera wheel to collect story fragments. The chronological confusion creates genuine internal contradiction that acts in scene. However, the final negotiation with the ghost lacks embodied cost—the agreement feels abstract rather than viscerally earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's negotiation with her ghost, showing ambitions "no longer eroded but reshaped." The accumulative/textural lens holds as fragments build toward this crystallization. Cost is implied through "regret washed over her fully now" but lacks a specific, visible price at closure—the reshaping feels conceptual rather than dramatically paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon constrains choices effectively—Elara must wade through its pools to collect fragments, and the carousel's halt triggers her reckoning. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting, its clicking mechanism enabling her fragment collection. Setting directly shapes the final negotiation occurring within the lagoon's "fractured stillness."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara confronting her eroded ambitions through ghost negotiation. The carousel's halt creates urgency, and collecting fragments builds pressure adequately. However, the ghost confrontation lacks tangible cost—no specific option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid when ambitions are "reshaped."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through collected fragments about erosion and ambition, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elara "whole in her broken sky" offers resonant answer to the central question of reconciling past/present selves. The camera wheel's transformation from film-advancing tool to story-collecting talisman creates meaningful metaphoric depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled imagery ("kinetic lagoon," "fractured stillness"). The chronological confusion manifests through syntax ("years—or was it moments?—ago"). Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("spectral echo," "talisman"), but overall texture supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in fragment collection sequence ("Another fragment drifted by...Elara collected it greedily"). The paraphrase loop of "ambitions erode/eroded" recurs without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chronologically confused scavenger negotiating with her ghost-self offers fresh angle on ambition/regret themes. The kinetic lagoon setting above clouds creates distinctive world-logic. However, the resolution of reshaping rather than rebuilding ambitions takes a safer middle path, avoiding bold commitment to loss or renewal.</comment>
