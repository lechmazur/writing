<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's guilt-without-memory paradox creates genuine internal contradiction that drives his choice to walk the labyrinth. The widow's characterization as "simultaneously ancient and somehow untouched by time" feels specific and earned. Minor deduction for the old woman's expository dialogue about time travel that briefly flattens her mystique.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Charged Poise closure—Marcus steps onto the bridge with visible cost ("a man with no memory of his sins, carrying only the strange, terrible gift of still being able to feel"). The baseball's impossible signature and bioluminescent paths constrain choices effectively. Slight deduction for time-travel exposition that doesn't fully integrate with present stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake functions as more than setting—it reveals paths that shape Marcus's choice and creates a labyrinth that constrains movement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("phosphorescent moss," "shifting constellations of blue and green"). The cave-as-cathedral metaphor enriches without overwhelming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal forgiveness to systemic empathy restoration through Marcus visiting multiple victims' families. The revelation that his victims' loved ones have lost empathy deepens pressure. Cost is visible in Marcus's acceptance of his paradoxical burden, though the antagonistic pressure could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the forgiveness/memory paradox and the baseball's temporal impossibility—"futures could be changed." The final image of Marcus becoming "another ghost becoming light" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong integration of empathy-as-contagion concept through specific dramatic choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Marcus's focus on physical sensation ("surgical scars still ached," "memory extraction ports were still tender"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly "forgiveness isn't really about the forgiven." Some register elevation in narration ("cathedral of stone") slightly mismatches Marcus's post-procedure state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("another ghost becoming light"). Information density is high without overwriting. Deductions for occasional elevated diction ("indefinable that the procedure couldn't erase") and one instance of abstract phrasing ("something essential") that could be more specific.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The memory-extraction premise offers fresh angle on redemption narratives—guilt without memory is genuinely paradoxical. The bioluminescent organism paths as literal choice-visualization is inventive. Time-travel baseball signature adds unexpected depth. Slight deduction for familiar mystical-guide archetype.</comment>
