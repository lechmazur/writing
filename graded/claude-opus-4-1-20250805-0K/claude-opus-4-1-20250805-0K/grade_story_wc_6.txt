<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal conflict between inherited fire and chosen water manifests through embodied details (scarred hands, volcanic sand ritual) with clear motivation. The contradiction between destruction/preservation plays out through concrete choices, though some therapeutic framing ("proving that scars can sing") edges toward diagnostic language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Maya's grafting ritual crystallizes her transformation from inherited trauma to "unyielding compassion." Cost is visible through seven years of return, father's legacy, and the weight of saving what he destroyed. The piece teaches its pattern of elemental transformation early and pays it off through the talisman's creation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic sand constrain and enable Maya's ritual - the specific properties of cooled destruction becoming nurture matter to her transformation. Sensory details are selective (kelp touching ankle, clouds' shadows) and filtered through her firefighter's alertness, though some passages lean descriptive rather than active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transformation from destructive inheritance to protective purpose escalates through the ritual's layers - coin, thread, sand each adding meaning. The warehouse memory demonstrates cost (captain's doubt, her surprising tenderness), and the final grafting completes with "kelp-drift peace" as earned resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of grafting - binding what burned to what cooled - without explicit moralizing. The final image of Maya as "guardian of the space between destruction and renewal" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior fire/water imagery with earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with distinct perceptual signature - Maya reads fire and safety "as twin currents in the air." Voice modulates effectively from meditative ritual to urgent memory of the warehouse rescue, maintaining her professional alertness throughout without head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("obsidian lagoon breathed beneath the dunes"). Minor template patterns appear ("She understood...she chose," "She was not...nor was she") but don't obscure closure. Information density generally strong with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The grafting ritual as healing method and Maya as firefighter-daughter transforming inherited destruction offer fresh angles on trauma recovery. Specific details (brass coin from grandfather, red thread from mother) avoid generic healing narrative, though the "scars can sing" metaphor trends familiar.</comment>
