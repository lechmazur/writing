<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's journey from emptiness to integration is earned through concrete details like the shell cutting her palm and dirt under fingernails. The contradiction between her skepticism and being "charmed by the peace" creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "tragically radiant" label and some emotional summary in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Marina integrates her quarantined memories, transforming from "tragically radiant" to "simply, fully, herself" with visible cost (three years of emptiness, physical digging). The two shell halves reuniting creates a satisfying causal-within-accumulative structure. Slight deduction for the Institute backstory exposition that could be more compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden's transformation from absorbing light to releasing perfume mirrors Marina's journey effectively. Sensory details like "purple blooms so dark they seemed to absorb the dying light" and the shell's "calcium carbonate lattices" ground the fantastical premise. The garden constrains choice by holding the buried shell half, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from whispers to coordinates to full memory recovery, with Marina's digging representing agency against the Institute's imposed emptiness. The cost is clear—accepting both "grief and grace" rather than sanitized peace. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth progression without significant resistance or complication in the recovery process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shell metaphor—"not healing the break but honoring it"—avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept that memories are "architecture" not "diseases" reframes the entire premise. The final image of memories "learning to dance" offers resonant closure without stating the moral directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with evocative phrases like "archaeology in reverse" and "incandescent with grief." Some register drift into elevated diction ("calcium carbonate lattices," "resonance structures") that doesn't fully match Marina's established perspective. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the digging sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "velvet garden") and occasional abstract phrasing ("familiar unfamiliarity"). Minor template cadence in the middle exposition about the Institute.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of archiving trauma in a seashell's structure is genuinely fresh, combining sci-fi memory extraction with organic imagery. The specific detail of "calcium carbonate lattices" storing memories shows originality. Slight deduction for the somewhat familiar trauma-recovery arc, though it's elevated by the unique mechanism.</comment>
