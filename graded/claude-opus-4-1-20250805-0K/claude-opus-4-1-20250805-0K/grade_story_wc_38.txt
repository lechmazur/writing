<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation through inherited mystery and the dance-as-decryption method creates strong character-specific action, with embodied movement replacing standard cryptography. The revelation of familial connection lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "destiny" and "memories she'd never lived" that verges on telling rather than embodying the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dance methodology building to Resonant Reconfiguration when Maya understands her inherited role ("both the lock and the key"). The "Welcome home, granddaughter" reveal reweights all prior material with visible cost in the flooded laboratory's patient waiting. Orientation anchors establish who/where/when efficiently by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded laboratory constrains movement and creates atmospheric pressure through "green-filtered sunlight" and "brackish water." The hangman's dice and water formations actively shape choices and meaning. Setting doesn't quite reach 8+ because some descriptions remain ornamental rather than constraining specific decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Maya's dance revealing increasingly complex encrypted data, with the reversal sequence demonstrating "mastery over both creation and undoing." The dominant stake of decrypting forbidden knowledge carries cost in the world learning "what Dr. Elena Voss—her grandmother—had truly discovered." Pressure coheres but lacks a sharp foreclosure of options that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "encrypt vulnerability as strength" and transforming limitation into "something beautiful, something defiantly, mysteriously alive." The dance-as-language metaphor avoids explicit moralizing. The final water spiral holding its shape after Maya steps away provides resonant non-literal closure about inherited patterns persisting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Maya's movement-based cognition ("where others saw random symbols, she perceived choreography"). Voice maintains lyrical consistency through phrases like "patient intentions waiting for the right dancer." Some elevated diction ("impossible geometries," "mathematical poetry") occasionally drifts from the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("familiar weight of destiny," "smelling of memories she'd never lived"). Information density is strong in action sequences but occasionally loops conceptually around the dance-decrypt metaphor. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dance-as-decryption concept offers fresh transformation of the code-breaking trope, with specific embodied methodology replacing standard cryptography. The grandmother-granddaughter inheritance through movement creates non-obvious synthesis. The reversal sequence requiring Maya to "unweave what she'd woven" demonstrates committed risk-taking within the premise.</comment>
