<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's transformation from future-focused clairvoyant to present-aware witness is earned through concrete struggle, with her gift's blindness in the cave creating genuine vulnerability. The shadow-entity and pilgrim apply meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophizing about "everyday magic" that edges toward therapy-speak in the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera's perception fundamentally shifts from seeing only futures to witnessing the "living tapestry of the present," with the cost being her former certainty about dramatic prophecies. The accumulative/textural lens holds as the cave's sensory details and shadow-manifestations build toward this perceptual repricing. Slight dock for the explain-everything quality of the shadow-entity's dialogue mid-piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The singing crystal cave with its "phosphorescent veins" and "overlapping shadows that seemed to breathe" creates a vivid, constraining environment that enables Vera's transformation. The cave pearl dissolving into her palm provides tactile specificity. The setting directly shapes the protagonist's altered perception and charges the final image of "bright darkness."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: Vera's blindness leads to the shadow-entity's revelation about "quiet enchantments," then to her expanded awareness of the cave's history, culminating in her transformed sight. The cost—losing her certainty about dramatic futures—is legible but could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked present-moment magic versus dramatic future visions emerges through concrete cave imagery and Vera's perceptual shift. The "bright darkness" paradox resonates without forcing interpretation. However, the shadow-entity's explicit articulation of theme ("quiet enchantments that inhabit every ordinary second") and the final paragraph's direct thematic statements reduce subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical passages like "crystal formations sang their ancient harmonies" and controlled rhythm during Vera's expansion sequence. The shadow-entity's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldliness. Minor register drift when narration slips into explanatory mode ("Magic wasn't in the dramatic prophecies...") that doesn't match Vera's established perceptual voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid sensory work, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "bright darkness" concept is restated multiple times, and the final three paragraphs repeatedly explain Vera's transformation rather than embodying it. Template phrasing appears in "She could sense... She felt... understood that..." sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The inversion of a clairvoyant being blind to immediate reality offers a fresh angle on prophecy narratives. The "bright darkness" paradox and inhabited shadows create memorable imagery. The synthesis of seeing present complexity rather than future threads feels earned, though the explicit articulation of theme reduces originality impact.</comment>
