<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mariel's motivation is concrete and embodied through her careful transcription work, mixing dust with ink, and her "thistled calm" when discovering the broadcast targets her specifically. The internal complexity of preserving forbidden stories while maintaining her cover as an orchestra copyist drives credible choices. Minor deduction for the grandmother's wisdom feeling slightly convenient, though it's anchored in the present choice to activate dust.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mariel stepping into the mist carrying "luminous burden" crystallizes her choice with clear cost (risk of discovery). The piece teaches its pattern early (music containing hidden stories, dust as narrative carrier) and pays off through the concert hall activation plan. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove's warmth constrains Mariel's work conditions, while the shortwave radio's amber glow becomes both light source and connection to resistance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"mist-wrapped night," dust particles drifting through alcove air. The concert hall as future setting shapes tactical choices about dust dispersal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovery of pirate broadcast → realization it's meant for her → decision to embed rebel songs → preparing dust-infused scores. The dominant stake (restoring storytelling capacity) tightens when Mariel realizes she's known to the pirates, forcing commitment. Cost is visible in the risk she accepts stepping into the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of dust remembering stories, avoiding abstract statements about censorship or resistance. The ending reweights earlier details—the radio's non-electrical glow connects to "fireflies and foxfire," suggesting story's fundamental persistence. The concept of "secretly luminous" notes that only trained eyes can see creates layered meaning about hidden resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"The ember alcove breathed warmth" establishes tone immediately. Perceptual signature shows in how Mariel notices light qualities ("shortwave radio dial glow that painted her fingers in amber"). The pirate broadcast lyrics feel authentically cryptic yet decodable. Minor deduction for slight elevation in register during exposition about the story famine.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"transcribing orchestral parts by the shortwave radio dial glow" establishes action, setting, and constraint simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive passages and shorter urgent beats. Some mild redundancy in explaining the dust's narrative properties across two separate passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept of dust as traumatized story-carrier offers genuine freshness, transforming the censorship narrative through specific magical realism. The "secretly luminous" notes visible only to trained eyes provides non-obvious resistance mechanics. Risk-taking in the lyrical, indirect revelation method heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
