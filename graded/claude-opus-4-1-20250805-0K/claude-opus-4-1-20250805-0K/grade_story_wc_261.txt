<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's obsessive need to reopen healed wounds drives genuine internal contradiction, with embodied details like "drilling microscopic tunnels through scar tissue" grounding the compulsion. The final realization that "some wounds were meant to stay open, not as injury but as invitation" earns its resonance through prior dramatization, though the epiphany arrives somewhat cleanly without sufficient struggle in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation (scars, coffee rings, dispersed miracles) leading to a Conceptual Repricing where Maya reconceptualizes wounds as "channels through which wonder might flow." The cost is conceptually clear—perpetual openness to pain—though it could be more viscerally felt on the page. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tower setting and rooftop garden constrain Maya's perception through plant telepathy, with sensory details like "dawn light filtering through narrow windows, painting amber stripes" creating atmosphere. The coffee ring becomes micro-setting that charges the final understanding, though the hospital and city remain somewhat generic beyond the "meteor hush" metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on Maya's search for meaning in her scars, with escalation through the revealed dispersal of the miracle into "ten thousand tiny healings." The tension between seeking closure and remaining open provides genuine conflict, though the resolution arrives through revelation rather than dramatized struggle, limiting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of wounds as openings rather than closures emerges organically through concrete imagery, with the dispersed miracle serving as metaphor for democratized grace. The final insight that "miracles weren't displaced, only transformed" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the transformation feels slightly neat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with medical precision ("microscopic tunnels," "collagen") balanced against lyrical observation ("vegetable grief," "chlorophyll dreams"). The perceptual signature of reading patterns in accidental marks distinguishes Maya's consciousness, though some phrases like "grace might travel" drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The frosted hourglass turned for the last time" establishing both object and finality. Some elevated diction ("irreversible has burned through the atmosphere") occasionally strains, but rhythm varies effectively and no significant loops appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of reading stories in scar tissue offers fresh specificity, transforming the wounded healer trope through concrete medical detail and plant telepathy. The dispersed miracle avoiding concentration in favor of democratic distribution provides non-obvious moral calculus, though the resolution's tidiness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
