<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation to preserve a dying language through sensory translation is clear and compelling, with her copper veins serving as both physical trait and functional tool. Her transformation into a bone tower achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor deduction for the dying speaker three valleys away who never appears on-page, creating slight distance from the central conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the storyteller becomes part of the canyon's echo system, paying the ultimate price of her physical form. The closure lands with undeniable cost as she transforms into bone and copper threads. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of Thuvenli's texture-based properties which could be more concretely dramatized in the translation process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon setting directly constrain and enable the storyteller's choices, functioning as both instrument and eventual fate. Vivid sensory details like "copper veins catching moonlight" and towers humming "like organ pipes" create strong atmosphere. The environment becomes inseparable from the story's resolution, with the canyon walls literally incorporating the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving Thuvenli intensifies through the storyteller's active choices: using the cursed diamond, carving patterns into bone, creating a hybrid language. The escalation from listening to creating to becoming part of the canyon shows clear agency with visible cost. Minor deduction as the middle section could show more struggle or failed attempts before the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically from the concrete action of translating texture into sound. The final image of the storyteller becoming a bone tower powerfully reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral. The story achieves resonance through the paradox that true preservation requires fundamental change and sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the mythic tone, maintaining consistency through phrases like "copper-veined" and "texture-sound." The perceptual signature focuses on sensory translation and pattern recognition. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated diction ("phoneme of texture-sound") that briefly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("cascading through her consciousness"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for the abstract description of Thuvenli's properties and occasional register elevation that creates slight distance from immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of preserving an extinct language through sensory translation offers a fresh angle on linguistic death. The specific synthesis of copper veins, bone towers, and texture-based language creates an original mythology. The transformation of the storyteller into part of the canyon's architecture is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
