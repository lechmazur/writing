<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's grief-driven transformation from wedding rings to memorial pieces provides clear motivation, with contradictory impulses (designing the phoenix tattoo but unable to commit) acting in scene. The final choice to help another griever while contemplating her own permanent mark lands with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for the stranger's entrance feeling slightly convenient, though her parallel grief creates effective pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with density increase through repeated motifs (cranes, coordinates, memorial transformations) building to a resonant reconfiguration where Elena's workshop becomes a beacon for others. The closure lands with felt cost—her "subdued ardor for life returning...changed, refined by fire"—making the before/after transformation legible. Orientation anchors (observatory, three years since Marcus, six months since rock bottom) establish clearly within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting with its "stars wheeling overhead...marking time in their own ancient way" creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors Elena's transformation. Physical details (candlelight constellation, rice paper cranes, jeweler's bench) constrain and enable choices, particularly the workshop's glowing windows serving as beacon. The abandoned church, lighthouse, and rooftop garden coordinates ground the theme in specific places where "light broke through darkness."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to transform grief into purpose—deepens through Elena's interaction with the newly grieving woman, forcing her from solitary craft to active mentorship. The pressure coheres as Elena must demonstrate what she's learned about transformation while still unable to commit to her own phoenix tattoo. Cost is visible in her foreign-feeling smile and the recognition that transformation comes "refined by fire into something both genuinely artificial and absolutely true."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The phoenix motif—"half ash, half flame"—emerges organically from Elena's specific experience, avoiding stated morals while offering a resonant answer about "learning to burn without dying." The origami cranes containing coordinates create a concrete system for mapping recovery without exposition. The final image of the glowing workshop reweights all prior transformations as part of a larger pattern of souls finding light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with Elena's selective perception (noticing grief postures, recognizing fresh loss). The prose modulates effectively between lyric description ("curtains of intention...hung invisible") and grounded action. Dialogue between Elena and the woman carries subtext about transformation without over-articulation, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variations, particularly in the accumulation of coordinate locations and the final paragraph's measured cadence. Information density is strong—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Some figurative density in places ("curtains of intention," "constellation of flames") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor redundancy in explaining the phoenix symbolism ("learning to burn without dying" closely follows "half ash, half flame").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of observatory-as-refuge with grief-transformation workshop offers a non-obvious angle on mourning narratives. The specific detail of folding coordinates into paper cranes—actual locations where healing happens—transforms the helper-narrative trope through concrete particularity. The "genuinely artificial" phoenix that's "too precise for nature, yet somehow more truthful" provides fresh insight into how crafted meaning can exceed natural metaphor.</comment>
