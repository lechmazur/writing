<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from passive map-seller to active journey-taker is earned through concrete sensory details (the chip's warmth, grandfather's promise) and embodied contradictions between his empirical gift and personal stagnation. The final choice carries visible cost—abandoning thirty years of safety—though the emotional complexity could deepen slightly in the cavern beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus's stance crystallization from seller to guide, with the cost of unlived paths made visible in the doorway's map. The accumulative lens holds as childhood promise, rising creek, and ant-following cohere into inevitable transformation, though the cavern's rules could be slightly more grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern's "impossible summer light" and crystalline pools reflecting "scenes that weren't there yet" effectively constrain Marcus's choice while the ants' precise paths create micro-setting that drives action. The shop and creek are efficiently anchored, though the limestone cliffs and kudzu curtain could use one more specific detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal stagnation through the chip's arrival to the doorway revealing "every choice he'd never made," with the Morocco expedition and waiting woman adding concrete cost. The transformation from selling maps to following them lands with clear agency, though one more beat of resistance before entering would strengthen the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of maps-as-possibilities resonates through concrete particulars—the type foundry chip reading moments not places, the doorway showing unlived paths, Marcus becoming guide rather than merchant. The final image of printing "new legends on blank paper" reweights the entire premise without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("dusty shop," "empirically intuitive nature") and modulates effectively from melancholic opening to crystallized ending. The grandfather's dialect "follow the ants home" distinguishes generational voice, though Marcus's internal register could vary more under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks, with evocative phrases like "topology—the shape of choices not yet made." Some filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "Marcus watched") dull immediacy in transition beats, and "impossible summer light" borders on overwriting without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography and personal journey through the "doorway of decisions" showing moments rather than places offers genuine freshness. The empirically intuitive gift—knowing truth through touch—adds specificity, though the cavern's magical realism elements echo familiar portal fiction without full transformation.</comment>
