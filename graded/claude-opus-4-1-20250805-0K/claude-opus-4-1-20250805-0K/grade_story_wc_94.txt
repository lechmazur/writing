<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal contradiction between creating forbidden art and maintaining cover is embodied through concrete actions (developing poems in darkness, hiding work behind timetables). The final choice to continue resistance despite risk shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("furiously tranquil") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors (scars/stars, storms/revolution) culminating in Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes the medium of resistance. Cost is legible in Maya's exile and ongoing risk. Orientation anchors (observatory, night photographer, 17 months) land cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices (isolation enables contraband work) and the darkroom's red light/chemical process provides tactile specificity. Storm and stars create vertical geography that mirrors theme. The timer functions as micro-setting that marks ritual and risk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (developing banned work) through discovery of manuscripts to creation of bolder poems, with lightning strike marking peak intensity. The cost of exile and ongoing risk is clear, though the immediate scene lacks a decisive test that could push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the metaphor of negative space—censorship teaching what cannot be said paradoxically shows how to say it. The final image of mist passing through chains resonates without stating a moral. The scars-to-stars transformation reweights all prior censorship as inadvertent instruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through photographic/astronomical metaphors consistent with Maya's dual role. Some elevated diction ("rarefy," "cartography") fits the poet-narrator but occasionally drifts toward purple. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but several instances of abstract telling ("furiously tranquil," "eternal three minutes") and mild overwriting in metaphor density. Some paraphrase loops around the censorship theme. Information density is high but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poeticism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of photography, astronomy, and poetry as resistance tools feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of learning revolution's grammar through censorship's negative space transforms a familiar dystopian setup. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
