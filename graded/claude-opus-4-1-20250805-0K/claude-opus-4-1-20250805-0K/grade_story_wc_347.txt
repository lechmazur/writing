<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between duty and freedom manifests through concrete micro-choices (giving away the walnut, creating light paths) with visible cost. The contradiction between her trapped state and her compulsive helping of others drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the grandfather's backstory feeling slightly exposition-heavy in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure—Mara's choice to remain and continue her duty lands with felt cost ("Perhaps tomorrow she'd be free. But tonight, she'd saved two more lives"). The walnut's journey from pocket to child's hand creates meaningful change. Deduction for the orchard curse mechanics remaining somewhat abstract despite their centrality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The inverted orchard ("trees that grew backward into the earth") and mechanical birds create a vivid, constraining environment that shapes choices. The labyrinth's stone corridors and frost deadline pressure action. Missing higher band because some world rules (the curse's origin, the blueprint's mechanics) lack full sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The frost deadline creates genuine time pressure ("Three hours, seventeen minutes") that drives pacing. Mara's choice to give away her freedom token (the walnut) represents meaningful stakes. The escalation from hearing the cry to guiding travelers to giving up escape is coherent but could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of duty versus freedom emerges organically through Mara's actions and the inverted orchard metaphor. The final lines ("Perhaps tomorrow she'd understand. Perhaps tomorrow she'd be free. But tonight, she'd saved two more lives") offer resonant ambiguity without moralizing. The "graceless beauty of survival" lands through scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's voice shows distinct perceptual signature ("offhandedly exact precision of someone who'd made this calculation thousands of times"). The narrative maintains consistent psychic distance and POV control. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot, though limited in quantity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in the middle section ("graceless beauty," "stumbling purpose") approaches overwriting but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The inverted orchard concept and Mara's light-path ability offer fresh angles on the reluctant guardian trope. The specific detail of trees growing downward while roots reach skyward creates memorable imagery. The mechanical birds as programmable sentinels rather than antagonists shows thoughtful world-building.</comment>
