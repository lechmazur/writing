<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her exile from the nostalgia ban, with embodied emotion in her dance movements that channel cosmic forces. The internal conflict between isolation and the need to create something lasting drives her final choice to sacrifice herself for future rebellions. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed in the final third without sufficient build-up of the cost, and some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("cosmic verse," "living document") rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the dance ritual that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts capture to seed future rebellion. The closure lands with visible cost ("by dawn, the authorities would detect...and come for her") and the transformation of her body into living art. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the moonstone dust multiplication which strains physical causality without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden setting with wisteria, marble statues, and pooling shadows creates vivid atmosphere that constrains Mira's choice to perform her forbidden art here specifically. Sensory details like "dew-slicked stones" and the moonstone dust's luminous threads effectively integrate with action. The garden becomes essential to the closure as it will "hold her imprint" and seed future rebellions, making the environment inseparable from the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating art that will outlast tyranny despite inevitable capture—is signaled early and tightens as the ritual progresses from a grain of dust to full-body transformation. The escalation follows the textural lens as the moonstone dust multiplies and spreads, with clear cost in accepting tomorrow's capture. However, the lack of immediate external pressure or complication during the dance itself slightly weakens the escalation's visceral impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory as resistance emerges powerfully through the concrete act of forbidden dance and the moonstone dust from the destroyed necklace. The ending offers a resonant answer about how art and memory persist through sacrifice, with the garden holding Mira's imprint for future rebels. Minor deduction for the slightly heavy-handed exposition about the Council's fears in paragraph six rather than letting the theme emerge purely through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to Mira's artistic sensibility, with distinctive phrases like "obsidian grace" and "tide dancer." The POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature focuses on cosmic and oceanic imagery fitting her character. Some diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin") that slightly distances from immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful figurative language that supports the mystical tone, particularly in descriptions of the dance and transformation. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("cosmic verse," "living document of defiance") and mild repetition of concept words (memory/remembrance, cosmic/celestial) create minor opacity. The "gaps between" concept in paragraph four, while thematically relevant, borders on over-explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story freshly combines dystopian memory suppression with mystical dance and cosmic connection, avoiding typical rebellion tropes through the specific choice of art as resistance. The moonstone dust transformation and the idea of seeding future rebellions through embodied art shows originality. The concept of finding truth in "gaps between" offers a non-obvious philosophical angle, though some elements like the wisteria garden feel slightly conventional.</comment>
