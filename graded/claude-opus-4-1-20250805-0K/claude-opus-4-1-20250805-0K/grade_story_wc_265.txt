<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to recover "untamed thought" drives consistent choices, with internal contradiction between his careful philosopher-self and wild-frontier memories creating genuine tension. The final choice to seed others' minds with mechanical growth shows earned agency with visible cost (dissolution into morning light). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("unlimited possibility") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the gear's placement transforms the forest's song and promises future arrivals, with cost visible in the protagonist's nightly dissolution. The piece teaches its pattern early (translocation, mechanical consciousness) and pays it off through the Loom Tree revelation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "Great Dampening" concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Mechanical Rainforest constrains choices excellently—each tree species' frequency guides navigation, and the Loom Tree's socket drives the crucial gear placement. Vivid sensory work ("copper vines," "steam hissed," trees singing in frequencies) creates a lived-in hybrid world. The setting directly enables the final transformation when the forest changes its song.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: gear's hum → following it deeper → Loom Tree revelation → placing the gear → forest transformation. The protagonist's agency drives each step with visible cost (nightly translocation, fractured memory). The stakes deepen from personal memory recovery to collective liberation of "untamed thought."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mechanical-organic fusion metaphor—rigid philosophical thought versus wild frontier imagination. The Loom Tree as thought-made-manifest and the gear as "seed" of new thinking avoid direct statement while building resonance. The ending's promise of others arriving to rediscover their frontiers offers a non-literal answer to freedom of thought without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with philosophical register appropriate to character ("probability streams ripening toward miracles"). Consistent POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("liminal moment," "feral and mate with logic") but mostly serves the piece's conceptual density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("wild frontier of unlimited possibility," "careful, catalogued garden") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical nature with consciousness themes creates memorable world. The specific innovation of trees singing in frequencies that encode memory/thought is non-obvious. The "Great Dampening" backstory and rebellion through dream-architecture shows risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
