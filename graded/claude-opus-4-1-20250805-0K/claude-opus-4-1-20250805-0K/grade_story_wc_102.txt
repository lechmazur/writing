<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mae's spiritual curiosity drives consistent choices through the camera obscura's revelations, with embodied reactions to the past life memory ("copper of that ancient heartbreak on her tongue") and the breathing pattern as learned behavior. The ghost woman adds pressure that forces Mae's final renunciation—giving rather than taking—with visible cost as she releases years of captured loneliness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design builds through sparks→memory→tear→door revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mae discovers she must give rather than take, releasing her photographs with clear cost ("empty and full simultaneously"). The closure lands with Mae's pilgrimage completing through sacrifice, though the orientation could anchor "where" more precisely early on.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The viaduct with twilight-blooming wisteria creates atmospheric pressure, while Kwan Yin's tear and the camera obscura function as micro-settings that constrain Mae's choices. Sensory details like "frequency felt more than heard" and "door made of compressed starlight" serve the mystical tone, though the physical geography remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative revelation: sparks intensify→ghost appears→tear transforms vision→door manifests→understanding inverts (give not take). Mae's agency drives each deepening through breathing patterns and the choice to use the tear, with clear cost when she sacrifices her life's work of photographs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "unused love" must be fed rather than harvested, reweighting Mae's entire photographic practice as unconscious preparation for this offering. The final image of sparks trailing "like a comet's tail" while Mae carries the secret forward resonates without moralizing, suggesting healing through giving rather than taking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive mystical voice with controlled rhythm ("phosphorescent trail that only the spiritually curious could see") and effective modulation during revelation sequences. The ghost's dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly register, though some phrases like "foggy lucidity" and "spiritually curious" edge toward abstraction rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("prayer written in stone," "compressed starlight and forgotten promises"), though some abstract phrases weaken precision ("foggy lucidity," "spiritually curious"). Minor redundancy in explaining the camera's purpose twice, but strong propulsion through varied sentence structures and the final paragraph's rhythmic acceleration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura as spiritual tool revealing "what light concealed" rather than capturing it, with the inversion that unused love requires feeding rather than taking. The specific detail of crystallized tear as lens modifier and photographs dissolving into light shows imaginative particularity beyond template mysticism.</comment>
