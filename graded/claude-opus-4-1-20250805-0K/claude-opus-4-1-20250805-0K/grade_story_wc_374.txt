<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's transformation from skeptic to weather-carrier is earned through embodied sensory details (tasting compass directions) and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final acceptance carries visible cost as her implants shift from doubt-blue to aurora-green, though some expository passages about weather-carriers lean toward tell over show.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and convergences build toward Marina's transformation into a weather-carrier, with cost visible in her acceptance of what she'd spent a lifetime denying. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she tastes "her destiny on tin and starlight," though the forest election subplot doesn't fully integrate with the main revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora serves as active setting that constrains the convergence point and enables the transformation through "terrestrially cosmic forces." The tin compass ring functions as micro-setting, its changing metallic tastes guiding Marina's journey and charging the final image of "tin and starlight."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Marina's skeptical investigation to discovering her inherited weather-carrier nature, with meaningful deepening when the other carriers arrive and reveal the truth. The cost is legible in her lifetime of denial being overturned, though the forest election feels like a parallel rather than integrated pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of inherited destiny versus skepticism emerges through the tin ring's taste-based navigation and Marina's neural implants shifting from doubt to acceptance. The final image of tasting destiny "on tin and starlight" resonantly answers the central question, though Simon's explanation edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Marina's synesthetic taste-compass system and the bioluminescent doubt visualization. Voice maintains consistency through scientific-poetic register ("terrestrially cosmic," "emergent compass"), though dialogue occasionally drifts toward exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("copper-sweet magnetic north shifting to bitter east") with strong sensory specificity. However, some passages contain expository density that slows momentum, and phrases like "futuristic nostalgia" and "atmospheric consciousness" edge toward conceptual abstraction rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The taste-based compass navigation system and bioluminescent doubt implants create fresh, specific world-building that serves character and theme. The synthesis of scientific monitoring with inherited mystical ability transforms the weather-carrier trope through lived sensory detail, earning bonus for risk-taking that heightens coherence.</comment>
