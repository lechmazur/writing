I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between performed masculinity and authentic self drives compelling choices, particularly in the unwrapping scene. The contradiction between protection through disguise and imprisonment by it creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for Torven's somewhat abrupt emotional softening, though his vulnerability lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - Mira's transformation enables seeing Cetacea. The scrimshaw discovery through binding removal to island manifestation follows coherent escalation. Cost is visible in abandoning protective identity. Deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the final third and convenient timing of multiple arrivals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as liminal space between worlds, constraining where transformation occurs. Phosphorescent water and bioluminescent beaches create vivid sensory detail. The dock setting establishes Mira's performed identity effectively. Minor weakness in generic workplace opening before finding specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal safety through identity revelation to collective authenticity. The Pacification worldbuilding creates unique non-violent conflict. Mira's choice to unwrap bindings despite vulnerability shows clear cost. The arrival of others slightly dilutes individual stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of authentic self versus constructed identity emerges organically through Mira's binding/unbinding and the island's appearance condition. The scrimshaw as key to "guarded hearts" resonates without overstatement. Final image of abandoned clothes reweights the journey effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's selective perception of grace and danger reflects her defensive positioning well. Dialogue between Mira and Torven carries subtext about hidden selves. Some register elevation in passages like "sublittoral fringe" and "detach from false selves" slightly exceeds dock worker lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the transformation sequence. Several instances of elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "shimmering," "phosphorescent") create mild register inconsistency. The "authentic souls" phrase in the penultimate paragraph approaches thesis-speak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Pacification creating bodily rebellion against violence offers fresh worldbuilding. Cetacea as manifestation of collective authenticity rather than physical place shows originality. The specific intersection of gender performance and magical realism feels distinctive, though the self-acceptance arc follows familiar patterns.</comment>
