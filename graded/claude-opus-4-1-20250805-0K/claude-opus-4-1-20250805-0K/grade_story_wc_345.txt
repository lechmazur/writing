<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's ghostly motivation—protecting the community she watched grow for centuries—drives her chalk messages with clear internal consistency. The families' progression from suspicion to collaboration shows authentic character change earned through discovery. Slight deduction for the convenience of Marina's perfect timing and knowledge of the fungal network solution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as Marina's messages gradually build trust and understanding across the divided families, culminating in the bell's materialization as a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (Marina's fading) and community transformation. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient six-month resolution timeline that compresses the agricultural reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating stone arches and crimson sky create a distinctive otherworld setting that frames the ghost's movements. The fungal network beneath the orchards becomes plot-critical, constraining solutions to cross-boundary cooperation. The butterfly bell's transformation from ethereal to physical charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blight creates genuine pressure that forces the families from isolation into desperate collaboration. Marina's messages escalate from cryptic hints to specific instructions, tightening options toward cooperation. The cost—Marina's final fading after completing her purpose—is visible but the agricultural crisis resolves somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of community transcending suspicion emerges organically through the fungal network metaphor—diversity creating immunity. Marina's final message "Strangers built this world. Suspicion nearly killed it. Family saved it" resonates without preaching. The bell's transformation from ghostly tool to communal symbol perfectly embodies the thematic arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The omniscient POV maintains consistent distance while accessing Marina's ghostly perspective and the colonists' reactions. Voice modulates appropriately between ethereal descriptions of Marina and grounded agricultural concerns. Some register elevation ("brambled hope," "nebula of respite") slightly strains against the practical orchard setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures supporting the accumulative rhythm. Information density is generally good, though some passages lean toward the descriptive ("frozen clouds," "butterfly garden watering bell"). Minor template cadence in the resolution section ("The Hendersons brought... The Nakamuras added... The Okafors contributed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ghost-as-community-guardian who communicates through chalk messages offers a fresh angle on spectral intervention. The fungal network as metaphor for community interdependence transforms the blight plot beyond simple agricultural crisis. The specific detail of the butterfly bell materializing adds memorable particularity.</comment>
