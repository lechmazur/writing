<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal rebellion through drumming creates contradictory impulses that act in scene, particularly in her maintenance of individual consciousness while entering the collective. The final choice to transform rather than extract is earned through prior causality with visible cost (her body failing). Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("experimental treatment guinea pig") and slightly convenient knowledge of the scientists' true purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira transforms the memory cage into a "nursery for dreams." Cost is visible through her physical dissolution and the irreversible transformation. The pattern of drumming messages accumulates meaning that pays off when the subnet activates. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the experimental setup's mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image of transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("acoustic flowers pulse in rhythm with her failing heartbeat"). The crystalline barrier and the boundary between individual/collective consciousness shape Mira's tactical options throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Mira's drumming pattern reaches critical mass at "the hush of the universe inhaling." The dominant stake (preserving human consciousness versus harvesting it) tightens when Mira releases her encoded pattern, forcing an irreversible transformation. Cost is legible through her physical dissolution and the system's inversion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between capture and creation, with the final image offering a non-literal answer that consciousness "isn't meant to be captured. It's meant to create." The acoustic flowers' impossible bloom and the transformation of "aurora sorrow" from ending to transformation resonates without stating a moral. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in the collective consciousness passages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through musical/acoustic vocabulary and the specific way Mira notices frequencies and resonances. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the transition to the shared consciousness space. Some register elevation in peak moments ("ineffable quality that made them sacred") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional elevated diction mismatched to context ("confluence where consciousness pooled"), some abstract phrasing in the middle section, and minor repetition of "consciousness" without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of encoding rebellion through drumming patterns that create a subnet within a memory-harvesting system offers a fresh angle. The transformation of memory preservation into active dream generation is non-obvious and feels earned. The specific synthesis of sound, memory, and consciousness creates genuine novelty within the experimental treatment framework.</comment>
