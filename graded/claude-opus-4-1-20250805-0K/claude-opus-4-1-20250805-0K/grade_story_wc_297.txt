<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's root-bound nature creates genuine internal tension between being anchored and understanding temporal flux, with her "purposefully curious" trait driving concrete investigative actions. The final choice to sign the covenant carries visible cost ("ready to sign her name in starlight"), though the emotional specificity could deepen beyond "anxious elation."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as temporal fragments and scars layer toward Mira's signing of the covenant—a Charged Poise moment where she accepts her role as anchor. Cost is conceptually present ("roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing") but could be more viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (cobalt glade, dusk, Mira with topiary cutting) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glade's blue grass and the maze topiary cutting function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the cutting holds coordinates and must be pressed to earth to reveal the intersection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("waxy leaves bend but not break"), with the environment actively responding to Mira's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural layering: future-self's warning, the cutting's warming response, spreading maze pattern, until Mira must decide whether to sign. The dominant stake (understanding/healing temporal wounds) tightens as the intersection reveals itself, though the final cost could be more explicitly dramatized beyond conceptual acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the root-bound metaphor—being anchored enables perception of change, limitation becomes strength. The final image of "roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing" offers resonant non-literal answer to the paradox of stability versus transformation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Mira's botanical lens ("root-bound," "seeds," "gardener") and her unique ability to read reality's scars "like braille." Some register elevation occurs ("liminal space where collective unconscious met quantum possibility") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery, though abstract passages ("intersection of dreams—that liminal space where collective unconscious met quantum possibility") occasionally drift into conceptual telling. Some elevated diction ("anxious elation thrumming through her veins like electricity through water") borders on overwriting without quite crossing into purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of time folding backward with only root-bound individuals noticing offers genuine freshness, particularly the concept of reading reality's scars as navigation method. The synthesis of botanical metaphors with temporal mechanics creates non-obvious connections that feel earned through Mira's specific perspective.</comment>
