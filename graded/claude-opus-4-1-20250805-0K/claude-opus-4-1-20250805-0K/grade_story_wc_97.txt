<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marion's contradictory impulses—strategic creativity in constructing hope versus the reality of loss—act simultaneously throughout, culminating in her improvised symphony that literally creates a corridor through impossible physics. The final choice to build refuge rather than merely search earns its resonance through accumulated musical attempts and film study, with visible cost in her "trembling fingers" and two years of solitary persistence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through musical phrases, film frames, and compass behaviors until Marion's improvisation crystallizes into Sophia's return—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights "home" from destination to creation. The cost is legible in the two-year wait, the broken clock lurching forward, and the explicit acknowledgment that compasses "point to where home waits to be built."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Celestial Terminal's coral bones become an instrument Marion plays through, with compasses serving as active constraints that shape her musical experiments and ultimately respond to her improvisation. The setting's vertical impossibility (floating station with coral roots through clouds) and magnetic storms aren't mere backdrop but create the specific conditions enabling the film-refuge discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries—from finding the films to recognizing spliced frames to matching musical patterns—until tonight's "stronger magnetic disturbance" forces Marion's improvised bridge between worlds. The cost manifests in her two-year isolation, the risk of temporal displacement, and the irreversible choice to alter reality's fabric through unauthorized harmonics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme emerges through the transformation of navigation from finding existing destinations to creating refuges where the lost can return, crystallized in Sophia's line about compasses pointing "to where home waits to be built." The broken anniversary clock's single tick forward and the stars as "perforations in film" create a resonant answer about time and possibility without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct register of impossible geography ("calcified coral reaching down through cumulus") and temporal distortion ("compasses... pointing toward memories instead of north") that never breaks character. Sophia's dialogue carries appropriate weight for someone dwelling between frames, though Marion's internal voice could risk more compression under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the sun tracked its arc toward evening" simultaneously marks time, isolation, and routine—though occasional filter constructions ("Marion could feel") slightly dull immediacy. The syntactic variety from complex opening imagery to shorter action beats during the improvisation creates effective rhythm without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of aviation disaster, musical performance, and cinema as literal refuge creates an inevitable-feeling logic where film emulsion becomes a habitable space between realities. The specific innovation of compasses pointing toward memories and musical harmonics creating magnetic corridors elevates familiar lost-love elements through committed world-building.</comment>
