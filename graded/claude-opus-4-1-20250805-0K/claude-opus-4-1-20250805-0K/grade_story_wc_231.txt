<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Magnus's gift of wearing memories creates compelling internal contradiction between his burden and need for connection. The final choice to keep watching with recovered memories shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for the son's motivations arriving late without sufficient groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories layer and gaps reveal pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Magnus recovers stolen joy while accepting isolation. Cost is legible in the son's "baptism" and Magnus's continued solitary watch. The revelation structure works backward causally from gaps to wholeness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock's moonstone colors and lighthouse beam rotation constrain discovery through timed gaps in memory. Nautical twilight precisely frames the liminal investigation. The Edelweiss as mountain bloom "exiled to tidal pools" charges the father-son separation spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from investigating a stranger's gesture to recovering one's own stolen memories, with the son's burden-shedding creating reciprocal cost. The pattern of gaps aligning with lighthouse sweeps tightens the investigation methodically. Cost lands in both the son's desperate cleansing and Magnus's acceptance of "witnessed isolation."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of inherited memory and its burden emerges through concrete objects—boutonniere, compass, watch—each containing stolen joy. The final image of memories surfacing "desperate and gasping" reweights the opening's severed finger as amputation and recovery. "Softly persistent" recurs meaningfully as both resistance and return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with phrases like "nautical twilight" and "softly persistent silence." The perceptual signature of noticing gaps and timing patterns reflects Magnus's lighthouse-keeper precision. Minor repetition of "softly persistent" works thematically but slightly dulls freshness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and selective detail, particularly in the discovery sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("witnessed isolation," "softly persistent") occasionally strains but serves thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of edited memories—gaps as the only intact spaces—offers fresh angle on memory fiction. The specific use of nautical twilight and lighthouse rotation to structure revelation shows originality. Somewhat familiar territory of father-son estrangement limits higher scoring.</comment>
