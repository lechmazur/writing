I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered reflections and symbolic accumulation rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation around ethical storytelling is consistent and embodied through concrete details like the calligraphy practice and puppet shows. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - he remains "uncommonly serene" throughout without visible struggle. The story tells us about his revolutionary heart but doesn't show internal contradiction in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with Marcus preparing for tomorrow's show rather than dramatizing any actual change or choice. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear, but the accumulative structure doesn't cohere toward a resonant reconfiguration. The final image of touching brush to paper doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radar dome setting is vivid and purposeful, transforming echoes into meaning that mirrors Marcus's narrative experiments. Sensory details like "shadows in the dying light" and "meteor hush" are selective and atmospheric. The setting constrains choice through its acoustic properties and isolation, though it could more actively pressure the immediate conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ethical storytelling) is signaled but never faces concrete on-page testing - the conflict happened twenty minutes ago and Marcus simply prepares for tomorrow. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; he remains in the same serene state throughout. The piece lacks escalation under any lens, with no visible price paid or options narrowed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of narrative ethics emerges through concrete details like the story stick's notches and puppet show descriptions. The concept of "reversing narrative flow" offers an interesting angle, though it's more stated than dramatized. The piece avoids moralizing but doesn't achieve resonant ambiguity because the protagonist's stance never wavers or gets tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice has distinct texture with phrases like "cathedral echo" and "meteor hush," maintaining consistent psychic distance. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("manufactured consent," "subversive act") that feels more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("curved overhead like the skull of some ancient giant") but suffers from abstract telling about Marcus's methods rather than showing them. Several paraphrase loops appear, like the repeated explanations of his narrative reversal technique. Information density is uneven, with some paragraphs restating concepts without advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of using puppet shows to reverse narrative causality in dive bars is genuinely fresh. The story stick as memory holder and the radar dome as acoustic workshop show inventive world-building. However, the execution doesn't fully commit to showing this premise in action, keeping it at arm's length through summary.</comment>
