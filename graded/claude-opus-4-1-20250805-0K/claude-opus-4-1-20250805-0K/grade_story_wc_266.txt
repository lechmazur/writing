I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphorical accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Marina releases her need for control.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal contradiction between wanting freedom for her dog and fearing loss manifests beautifully through embodied details like the star-punched ticket and "fingers that knew how to open." The confession "I was never brave enough to let him run free" crystallizes her motivational core. Minor deduction for the ferry guides remaining somewhat archetypal despite their "gently persistent" characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marina's transformation from gripping to releasing lands with visible cost—the star-shaped holes "where light could finally enter" poetically render her changed state. The accumulative structure coheres as limestone/water/twilight imagery builds toward the final image of "no longer needing any leash at all." Slight softness in the middle transition between boat and shore keeps this from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway functions as both literal and metaphorical setting, with limestone, mist, and hidden water creating atmospheric pressure. Strong selective detail like "channels between the limestone teeth" and water that "whispered names." The setting constrains choice through the twilight-only crossing rule, though the sudden appearance of water "where none should exist" could use clearer grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening—from chasing the dog to boarding the ferry to seeing "every unleashed joy she'd ever denied herself." The star-punch moment creates tangible transformation. Cost is legible in what Marina must release, though the stakes could intensify more sharply in the middle passage where the ferry journey feels somewhat predetermined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of holding/releasing, with the leash becoming a symbol for all constrained possibilities. The ending reweights everything—the dog transforms into "every adventure she'd postponed," making Marina's journey universal without stating a moral. The ferry guides' role as threshold guardians between "holding on and letting go" resonates without overexplanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm—"limestone spine where mist clung like unspoken prayers" establishes texture immediately. POV remains stable in close third, with free indirect style handling Marina's realizations naturally. The guides' dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly register. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds Marina's established lexicon ("phosphorescence," "traverse").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and metaphorical tracks. Some figurative density in peak moments ("voices braiding together like mist and limestone") occasionally tips toward overwriting but remains coherent. The closing image powerfully synthesizes the journey without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry/crossing mythology with the specific emotional truth of pet ownership and control. The transformation of the dog into "the shape of every unleashed joy" is earned and non-obvious. The "indirect routes" motif and star-shaped light create memorable specificity. Risk-taking in the metaphorical expansion pays off, though the ferry-crossing frame itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
