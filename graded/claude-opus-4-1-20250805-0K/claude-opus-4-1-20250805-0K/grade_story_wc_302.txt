<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's progression from seeker to keeper shows clear motivation rooted in the cipher's unfolding, with embodied details like the watch growing warm against her palm. The transformation lands with visible cost—she must document forever, becoming part of the library's system. Internal contradictions between caution and exuberance operate throughout, though some abstract phrasing ("mixture of caution and exuberance") lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the dreamer discovers she's both seeker and keeper, with the cost being her eternal role in the library's propagation system. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of delay and documentation build toward the revelation. Causality tracks cleanly from invitation through discovery to transformation, though the "future self" letter mechanism strains slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing library with its amber windows, humming bookshelves at different frequencies, and mist-cut robes creates vivid atmosphere that directly shapes the protagonist's journey. The setting functions as more than backdrop—the propagation delays and breathing walls ARE the discovery. Spatial choreography tracks well through marble steps, infinite halls, and transparent walls revealing other libraries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively as the dreamer moves from seeking a hidden library to understanding she must become its eternal keeper. The propagation delays create meaningful pressure by forcing her to document patterns rather than rush through. Cost becomes legible when she realizes her documentation will guide future seekers forever, though the conflict could use more resistance to this fate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept that "unspoken words speak loudest in the pause"—manifested in propagation delays, documentation gaps, and the space between letters. The final image of the dreamer lifting her veil while the library recognizes her "coming home" resonates without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom about silence and potential through concrete library mechanics rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains dreamy precision with phrases like "consciousness folding through time like origami being undone and refolded" that fit the surreal setting. The librarian's dialogue carries appropriate formality and the POV stays controlled. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("cautious exuberance," "luminous maze") that occasionally feel writerly rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery like "whispers that echoed from nowhere and everywhere at once." Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Some abstract phrasing ("mixture of caution and exuberance," "infinite potential of the pause") and occasional template constructions ("She began to document," "She lifted her veil") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a library existing "between moments" accessible only between two letters offers fresh perspective on knowledge and silence. The propagation delays as the system itself rather than flaws transforms expected library tropes. The revelation that the dreamer has always been both seeker and keeper, writing her own future invitation, provides a non-obvious synthesis that feels earned.</comment>
