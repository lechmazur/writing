<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from grief to purpose is earned through concrete sensory memories and the physical catalyst of the perfume. The contradiction between preservation and loss drives authentic internal conflict, though some emotional transitions ("Tears came unbidden") lean slightly toward telling rather than embodied showing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through layered extinct scents building to Elara's transformation into "a living archive of olfactory memory." The closure lands with clear cost—she becomes the repository of loss itself—though the transformation mechanism could be more physically grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains and enables the transformation, with "spectral root systems" and "crystal shadows" creating a liminal space between presence and absence. The extinct flowers' nameplates and empty beds function as both setting and thematic pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to inherited purpose as each extinct scent triggers deeper revelations about her mother's work. The transformation carries clear cost—Elara loses her individual self to become a living archive—though the physical mechanics of this change remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "Some things must be lost to be truly held," with the final image of tears as "translations—converting loss into something luminous." The story resists simple preservation-versus-loss binaries, finding resonance in transformation itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with phrases like "trafficking in the light of lost things" and controlled psychic distance. Some moments of elevated diction ("aromatically cautious," "temporal echoes") occasionally drift from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("tears that weren't solely sorrowful but were portals to preserved worlds") but occasional abstract passages dilute momentum. Some metaphor mixing occurs ("tears...splitting into spectrums that painted memories") though the overall effect remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct flowers, memory preservation through light, and transformation through grief creates a fresh angle on loss. The specific detail of "lanterns infused with the final breath of dying stars" and the olfactory archive concept elevate beyond familiar grief narratives.</comment>
