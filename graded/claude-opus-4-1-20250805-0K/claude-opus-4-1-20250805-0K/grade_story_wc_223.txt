<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory impulses—documenting truth while being labeled false, preserving small gestures against grand narratives—drive genuine internal conflict throughout. Her final choice to remain as witness despite the new government's call shows earned renunciation with visible cost. The "benevolently ruthless with truth" trait manifests in concrete actions like spelling names of the forgotten. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "microseconds of meaning" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through Marina's word-walking ritual, the pawnless chessboard metaphor, and architectural acoustics toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she chooses witnessing over official participation. The cost is legible in "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N" and her commitment to the gallery over the new government. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the middle section's slight causality drift between crisis survivor backstory and present documentation work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as more than setting—its acoustic properties enable Marina's word-walking practice and metaphorically embody the preservation of unheard voices. The pawnless chessboard constrains meaning (absence of the ordinary dead) and charges the final image. Sensory detail filters through Marina's historian perspective. Minor deduction for some abstract passages that could ground more concretely in the physical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marina's choice between official witnessing and preserving small truths—coheres but doesn't significantly tighten until the arrival of the other survivor. The pressure builds through accumulation (her walking-writing ritual, the absent pawns' meaning) rather than causal escalation. The cost appears in her refusal to join the new government, but middle passages meander without increasing pressure under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing versus performance, small gestures versus grand narratives, emerges organically through the pawnless board and Marina's documentation practice. The final "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. However, passages like "historian of small gestures" and "unbinding small truths from large lies" edge toward thematic articulation rather than pure emergence through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina's perceptual signature—noticing architectural acoustics, small gestures, absences—remains consistent and character-specific. The walking-writing device creates distinct rhythm. Dialogue (brief but present) carries subtext when the other survivor calls. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("where whispers traveled like ghosts of legislation") but suffers from abstract passages and some paraphrase loops ("small gestures"/"microseconds of meaning"). The walking-writing creates propulsion, but middle sections contain scaffolding phrases. Information density varies; some paragraphs could be cut without loss. No major artifacts touch closure, preventing lower score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The walking-writing concept and pawnless chess metaphor offer fresh angles on witnessing and historical memory. The whispering gallery as sanctuary for unofficial history shows originality. However, the crisis actor conspiracy theory element feels somewhat familiar, and some philosophical passages ("nomadic penumbra") lean abstract rather than grounded in specificity.</comment>
