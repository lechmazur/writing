I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages, from the father's deception to Maya's honest reckoning, with Wei's arrival forcing the final moral calculation.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's characterization achieves exceptional depth through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - her inherited nimble fingers but not deception, her mathematical mind calculating fairness while working with death's finality. The line "subtracting his sins from her love, calculating what remained" crystallizes her earned stance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong causal architecture leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya's honest accounting transforms inherited debt into acknowledged responsibility. The closure "subtracting his sins from her love, calculating what remained. The answer, she found, was surprisingly simple. Everything" lands with clear emotional cost and reconfigures the entire premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prep room functions as more than setting - its "deathly vitality" and chemical-sweet air create a liminal space where transformation occurs. The embalming process constrains and shapes Maya's choices throughout, though some descriptive moments could integrate more tightly with action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Maya's "waiting actively" for Wei, through revelation of the account numbers, to the ink pot containing ashes - each beat tightening the moral calculation. The cost is legible in Wei's trembling hands and Maya's precise stitching of her father's lips, though one more turn could have deepened pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the mathematics metaphor - "calculate what people want to believe, subtract their skepticism" transforms into Maya's honest accounting. The ink pot's transformation from stolen object to vessel for ashes-as-apology reweights every prior element without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya's voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through mathematical framing and precise physical descriptions. Dialogue carries strong subtext - "That's not enough"/"No, but it's honest" - though Wei's voice could be more distinctly characterized beyond inherited rage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "working restoration cream into her father's weathered hands" simultaneously advances action, reveals character, and builds metaphor. Minor repetition of "mathematics" and some filter constructions ("Maya didn't flinch") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of con artistry, embalming, and mathematical honesty creates a non-obvious premise executed with precision. The transformation of the ink pot from stolen object to vessel for apologetic ashes shows genuine ingenuity, avoiding template redemption narratives through Maya's clear-eyed accounting.</comment>
