<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by thirty years of dedication to proving objects absorb emotions. Internal conflict between scientific validation and mystical knowing creates genuine tension. The final choice to document the frost patterns shows earned agency, though the emotional cost of her isolation could be more viscerally embodied in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the frost patterns provide visible proof, transforming Vera from outcast to vindicated scientist. The accumulative lens holds as emotional signatures layer through three generations into the final revelation. Cost is present in decades of isolation, though the triumph feels slightly unearned given the convenient timing of perfect conditions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and glass prism function as active setting elements that constrain and enable Vera's experiment. Sensory detail effectively captures the mist, light refraction, and frost formation. The arbor's accumulated whispers and the prism's generational history create lived-in specificity that charges the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is clear from the start and escalates when the prism reveals unprecedented frost patterns. Pressure tightens as morning warmth threatens the evidence. However, the lack of active opposition or complication makes the resolution feel too smooth; coincidence (perfect conditions) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "truthful lies"—truths told in languages science hasn't learned to speak. The final image of Vera holding crystallized generations resonates without stating a moral. The piece effectively bridges subjective experience and objective reality, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statements ("The boundary between mind and matter was more fluid...").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mystical-scientific register with controlled rhythm that modulates during the revelation sequence. Perceptual signature shows Vera's dual nature as mystic-scientist through selective attention to emotional wavelengths. Some elevated diction ("accumulated whispers," "emotional archaeology") fits the POV, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the revelation. Information density is high, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. However, some abstract phrases ("truthful lies," "shifted hush") appear without sufficient grounding, and occasional repetition of "accumulated" creates minor loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of objects absorbing emotions gains freshness through the specific mechanism of frost patterns revealing emotional signatures. The three-generational scope and synthesis of mysticism with scientific documentation creates a non-obvious angle. The "truthful lies" paradox and visual language of emotions offer genuine originality, though the vindicated-outsider arc follows familiar patterns.</comment>
