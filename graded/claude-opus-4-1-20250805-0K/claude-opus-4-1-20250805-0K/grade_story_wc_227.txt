<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—trembling hands against purposeful action, "too stubborn or too broken to flee" capturing her complex stance. The final choice to transmute despair while plunging toward death is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her acceptance of physical destruction for conceptual preservation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's plunge transforms from defeat into purposeful transmutation. Cost is unmistakable—her literal death traded for the story's survival. The kintsugi metaphor constrains tactics throughout, making the closure feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The acid sea and tilting workshop create genuine spatial pressure that forces Mira's choice, with sensory detail ("acid tang burning her throat") grounding the urgency. The statue's transformation from stone to "swirling galaxies" charges the final image, though some setting details remain ornamental rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through physical degradation (cables dissolving, platform tilting) that compresses time and narrows options toward the single choice. The cost is legible as Mira trades her life for the charm's preservation, with agency maintained through her smile at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kintsugi theme emerges organically through action—golden seams filling cracks—rather than declaration, with the final insight that "broken things weren't meant to be restored...but to become something more beautiful" reweighting all prior damage. The conceptual cost (accepting destruction as transformation) lands without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through alchemical precision ("three deliberate indentations") and compressed urgency under pressure. Brief dialogue with the statue maintains voice consistency, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("dire enchantment against the void") slightly beyond Mira's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and concrete imagery, but figurative density in places ("threads of golden light streaming from every crack") and occasional register elevation ("transmuting despair into something eternal") create minor friction. The phrase "dire enchantment" feels forced into the final paragraph rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of environmental catastrophe with kintsugi philosophy offers a non-obvious angle, particularly the inversion where preservation requires accepting destruction. Some elements feel prompt-driven (the exact phrase "dire enchantment") but the core transformation of breaking-as-beauty lands with specificity.</comment>
