<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma response through somatic markers and the palm-to-bark grounding moment. The protagonist's quiet talent emerging post-bombing creates compelling internal complexity. Minor deduction for some therapeutic self-awareness ("Dr. Mansour had taught her to read these somatic markers") that feels slightly too diagnostic for peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure through the image of dirt under fingernails while automated beacons sweep the landscape. The piece builds density through plant cultivation as response to destruction, landing on Earned Stasis with visible cost. The "both facts existed simultaneously, without resolution" crystallizes the acceptance of ongoing violence alongside persistent growth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting constrains choices effectively—the protagonist works within an abandoned space that mirrors her isolation. Sensory detail filters through trauma-altered perception ("white orchids everywhere, then white phosphorus"). The ancient cedar that "witnessed centuries" charges the grounding moment with temporal weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on finding sustainable response to trauma through cultivation rather than healing. The somatic panic sequence creates internal pressure that the protagonist manages through practiced grounding. Cost is visible in the acceptance that "the world would continue its violence" while she continues planting—a genuine trade-off between seeking justice and finding personal continuance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cultivation metaphor without stating its moral. The final image of automated beacons sweeping over "the living and the dead" while Amira drives with dirt under her nails resonantly answers how to persist after atrocity. The jade cutting that will "multiply into dozens of small, resilient offspring" embodies stubborn optimism without denying horror.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the world through botanical awareness and trauma markers. The voice modulates effectively from clinical observation of somatic responses to lyrical passages about plant succession. No dialogue appears, maintaining consistent interiority throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "white orchids everywhere, then white phosphorus, then white sheets." Some filter-verb clustering ("She thought of," "Perhaps he'd understood") and occasional abstraction ("something essential in aligning herself"). The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds to closure despite minor redundancy in "continue/continuing."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma response through botanical cultivation rather than conventional healing narrative. The "signature strike" detail and somatic marker framework provide specific grounding. The choice to make the garden's future succession patterns her legacy offers a non-obvious response to violence.</comment>
