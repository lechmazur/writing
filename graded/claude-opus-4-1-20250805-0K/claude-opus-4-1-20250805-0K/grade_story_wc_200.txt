<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with embodied emotion ("mouth opened and closed without sound") and clear internal conflict between perfectionism and self-acceptance. Thomas's confession "Never learned to laugh at my mistakes" reveals character-specific pain that drives the resolution. Minor deduction for Mara's somewhat generic helper role lacking internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking closure where Thomas embraces imperfection ("Play it broken and beautiful"). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as Thomas dissolves into light after accepting his flaws. Orientation anchored cleanly by ~50 words with who/where/when established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as more than backdrop—it amplifies sound to create pressure ("footfalls became thunderclaps") and transforms at sunrise into "cathedral of gold." The misaligned harp serves as micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory detail filtered through Mara's professional POV ("crocodile's tooth grew almost hot").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: Thomas's failed materialization → confession of shame → Mara's deliberate off-key humming that models acceptance → final embrace of broken music. The cost is legible when Thomas accepts imperfection means "worthlessness" yet plays anyway. One meaningful deepening that reweights his relationship to error.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: Mara's deliberate off-key humming teaches "We make mistakes into music." The final image of Thomas becoming "part of the morning's glow" offers non-literal answer about integration through acceptance. Minor deduction for slightly neat resolution of complex grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's professional attention to spectral states and Thomas's musician-specific focus on sound. Dialogue carries subtext ("what if the bride preferred it that way?"). Minor register elevation in "achingly luminous" doesn't match established voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("echoes...echo"). Information density solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for elevated diction clusters ("achingly luminous," "marriage of sorrow and joy") and one paraphrase loop ("another soul collected, another confession heard, another healing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle on ghost story through specific profession (lost soul collector) and unique resolution mechanism (embracing imperfection). The crocodile tooth compass and musical ghost avoid generic haunting tropes. Somewhat familiar therapeutic arc of self-acceptance limits higher scoring.</comment>
