I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered details of resistance (wing-beats, garden patterns, seed encodings) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Marcus's smile amid capture crystallizes the distributed nature of their rebellion.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus and Serena demonstrate clear, consistent motivations rooted in intellectual resistance. The contradiction between Marcus's apparent calm ("smiled despite himself") and underlying tension creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for Serena's slightly convenient competence without visible struggle in the tunnel escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building to Charged Poise - Marcus facing the Auditors while knowing the rebellion continues. The cost is legible in his acceptance of capture to enable Serena's escape. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, university, three years post-Tax) land cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both sanctuary and trap, with insects providing tactical advantage ("false positives on the scanners"). Vivid sensory work ("hummed with ten thousand wings," "condensation-fogged glass"). The beetles' response to tension and the mantises' scanner interference directly constrain choices at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation follows the accumulative lens through density increase - from coded seeds to Auditor arrival to orchestrated insect defense. The trade-off is clear: Marcus sacrifices himself to protect the network. One meaningful tightening as the Auditors triangulate and force Marcus's defensive gambit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ecosystem metaphor ("resistance isn't just action, it's ecosystem"). The final image of Marcus smiling while captured, knowing seeds are being planted, offers resonant answer to whether individual sacrifice enables collective resistance. No explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voices - Marcus's scientific precision versus Serena's "candidly cryptic" playfulness. Strong perceptual signature in how Marcus notices insect behaviors and their effects. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "photosynthetic rebellion" that doesn't fully match established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum. Information density high ("each groove a letter in their evolving alphabet"). Deduction for metaphor density in places ("choreographed dance of trowels and seeds") and one instance of template cadence in the insect release sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian surveillance with botanical resistance - "they hadn't yet learned to read tomatoes." The insect frequency scrambling and garden message grids offer non-obvious angles. Risk-taking in the quiet resistance model pays off with coherent world-building.</comment>
