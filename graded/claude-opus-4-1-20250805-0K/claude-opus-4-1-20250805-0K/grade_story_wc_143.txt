<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's purposeful curiosity drives meaningful choices through the final documentation of sublimating ice, with her decision to leave the hourglass creating visible cost. Her isolation and dedication are embodied through specific actions rather than labels, though some interior passages lean toward elevated register ("pregnant and blue," "dawnlit melancholy") that slightly distance from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered details toward Charged Poise closure where Vera's final vigil crystallizes humanity's retreat with felt cost. The hourglass placement and her departure with "only her camera and the knowledge" create legible before/after with visible renunciation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing in places ("what we'd dreamed and what we'd settled for").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tycho crater's fissure and sublimating ice constrain Vera's final vigil timing and shape her chemical message system choice. The lunar environment—vacuum, earthlight wavelengths, regolith properties—directly enables her documentation method and charges the final image of humanity's retreat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through the countdown to both ice's final emergence and evacuation rocket arrival, forcing Vera's choice between departure and witness. The chemical timer's six-hour burn creates temporal constraint that shapes her vigil. Cost is visible in leaving the hourglass and accepting humanity's retreat, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the grain of sand's journey, the last wisps of ice, footprints that will outlast their maker—without explicit moralizing. The final image of the Moon waiting "while humanity remembered why it had reached for the stars" reweights all prior material through earned resonance rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("pregnant and blue," "dawning hush"), though register occasionally elevates beyond Vera's technical background. Some passages drift toward essay voice ("The space age would continue, perhaps, but not like this") rather than maintaining embodied perspective throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Several instances of elevated diction ("dawnlit melancholy," "ethereal tendril") and abstract phrasing ("between what we'd dreamed and what we'd settled for") that could be more concrete. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward overwriting in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar space-age decline through specific details: chemical message system using lunar regolith, sublimating ice in Tycho's fissure, the nightwatch's hourglass containing Earth sand flung to Moon. The particular combination of elements feels organic rather than assembled, though the melancholy tone is somewhat expected for this premise.</comment>
