<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mae's contradictory impulses—loyalty to her father's memory versus her federal duty—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in the watch fob reveal where trust breaking becomes embodied action. The final choice to complete the recording despite permanent exile carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("racing pulse") rather than fully embodied sensation in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly with because/therefore linkage through Mae's three infiltration attempts leading to the watch fob gambit. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: Mae gains evidence but loses her father's world forever ("could never return"). The "sound of trust breaking" conceptually reprices from abstract goal to concrete betrayal. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the pirate market setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rotting pier and candlelit market maze constrain Mae's movements and tactics throughout. The watch fob functions as micro-setting that enables the crucial trust-breaking moment. Strong sensory work with "barnacle-crusted piling" and "dripping beams." Deduction for some generic elements ("candlelit chaos") and the market's physical layout remaining somewhat vague during the middle navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from failed infiltrations to the watch fob reveal that forces Mae's final choice between mission and belonging. The dominant stake—capturing evidence versus maintaining bloodline trust—tightens when the woman recognizes the federal badge, foreclosing Mae's option to remain. Cost is legible in "could never return." Minor deduction for the shipment stakes feeling slightly abstract compared to the personal betrayal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of trust's fragility emerges through concrete action—the watch fob's dual nature, the market's "truce of hush," Mae hunting "the precise moment when loyalty crumbled." The final image of "empty bottles and the echo of broken trust" resonantly answers whether some sounds are worth breaking. Deduction for Mae's closing line "Some sounds...were worth the breaking" slightly over-articulating the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mae's perceptual signature shows in how she notices criminal infrastructure through her father's lens ("forty years back"). Strong free indirect moments like "Tommy's girl. Not a question." Dialogue carries effective subtext, especially "Your daddy died honest. That's rare currency here." Deduction for some filter verb clustering ("Mae knew," "Mae understood") and slight register elevation in "gray economy's veins."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "drowning in reverse" and "algae in still water." Information density high in scenes of market navigation. Deductions for filter verb stack in emotional peaks ("Mae waited, knowing"), some elevated diction outside Mae's voice ("nocturnal rhythm," "gray economy's veins"), and repetitive "Mae [verb]" structures in several passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of recording trust breaking as sound offers a fresh angle on the undercover infiltration trope. The three failed attempts building to bloodline recognition shows solid transformation of familiar material. The specific detail of moonshine heritage grounding federal work adds authenticity. Deduction for the undercover agent story being fairly conventional despite these specific touches.</comment>
