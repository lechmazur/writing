<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's relationship with death as "colleague" and translator of its "syntax" creates a distinctive professional identity that drives her descent and interpretation of the captain's work. Her internal progression from technical recovery to philosophical understanding earns the final choice to carry the message forward, with visible cost in the library's imminent flooding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the impossible transmission, the preserved library, the infinite recursion of the snow globe, and Marina's final understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina accepts her role as messenger, with the cost legible in "The library would flood within hours" and her conscious choice to let it happen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library's air pocket creates a physical impossibility that constrains Marina's time and choices, while the snow globe's infinite recursion charges the final image. Sensory detail like "darkness thick as centuries" and "brass handles green with verdigris" grounds the fantastic elements in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the library's knowledge—tightens through Marina's discovery of the captain's equations, her understanding of his message, and her decision to surface with only the globe and journal. The air pocket's contraction creates temporal pressure that forces her choice, with cost visible in letting the library flood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation versus preservation emerges through concrete particulars: Earhart's plane "diminished" by discovery, the captain's equations mapping entropy, the snow globe's infinite preservation. Marina's final note that "preservation and release are the same motion viewed from different angles" offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a contemplative register appropriate to Marina's expertise, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophy ("death's language," "syntax through countless recoveries"). The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of someone attuned to electromagnetic frequencies and underwater archaeology stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several passages contain abstract phrasing that slows momentum ("another legendary disappearance solved, another mystery surrendered to time's patient archaeology"). Some metaphorical density in non-peak moments ("darkness thick as centuries") and occasional template constructions ("Marina understood... Marina descended... Marina lifted") reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of an underwater library maintaining an air pocket for 73 years, containing a recursive snow globe that models preservation itself, offers genuine freshness. The parallel with Earhart's discovery and the captain's equations mapping entropy create a non-obvious synthesis about loss and transformation.</comment>
