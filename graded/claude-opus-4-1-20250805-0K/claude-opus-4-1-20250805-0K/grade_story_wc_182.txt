I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal Drive Lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Mira decodes the diary, navigates traps, and negotiates with the mountain.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and builds causally from linguist to negotiator, with her expertise enabling the solution. The time traveler and other seekers lack individual characterization beyond their frozen state. Mira's offer to "document not hoard" shows character-specific problem-solving rooted in her scholarly nature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Mira transforms the library from trap to garden, with clear cost (completing the diary binds her to this work). The causal chain from diary discovery through trap navigation to negotiation holds well. Who/where/when anchored immediately in opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore setting actively constrains choices through self-rearranging passages and the circular trap room. Vivid sensory work with books "humming" and singing "pure meaning." The amber preservation and "condensed starlight" book binding create specific texture, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from exploration to survival as Mira discovers the frozen seekers and must avoid their fate. The circular room trap forces active problem-solving. The negotiation represents genuine agency with visible cost - she commits to completing the diary rather than taking knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "unlearned lessons" develops from title through discovery to transformation - knowledge hoarded versus shared. The final image of the mountain opening "all its passages at once" resonantly answers the question of wisdom's purpose. Subtext operates through the botanical diary's gaps being space for future knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception fitting an arcane linguist. Some register elevation in phrases like "condensed starlight" and "museum of failed rescue missions" that slightly exceed the established voice. The mountain's communication "not heard but felt" shows controlled non-standard dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some overwriting appears ("labyrinthine bookstore that had consumed Mount Erebis from within, its corridors spiraling through hollowed rock like the chambers of an ancient heart"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into ornamental metaphor. The "unheard symphony" edges toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a library preserving "unlearned lessons" offers a fresh angle on the knowledge-quest trope. Mira's solution to complete rather than take from the diary shows non-obvious problem-solving. The botanical diary serving as both map and payment method creates an organic synthesis of elements.</comment>
