<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's methodical-playful contradiction manifests beautifully through concrete action—she embraces uncertainty while maintaining professional precision. The final choice between explaining everything or nothing carries genuine cost as she seals away magic she's discovered. Minor deduction for Marcus's underdevelopment as mere exposition vehicle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—Elena crystallizes between infinite nested possibilities, choosing playful concealment over certainty with visible cost of sealing away discovered magic. The accumulative/textural lens holds as acoustic reflections and spiral rotations build pressure toward her stance crystallization. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden's acoustic architecture actively constrains and shapes the magical revelation—sounds transform, reflect, fracture into harmonics that become the mechanism for nested awakening. The hobo nickel's carved faces and the mural's rotating spirals create micro-settings that directly enable Elena's choice. Environment literally bends reality through designed acoustic properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through layered discoveries—nested artists, the hobo nickel, frozen time, reflected future voices—each tightening Elena's awareness of recursive reality. The cost manifests as she chooses ignorance over understanding, sealing the coin away for future iterations. Minor deduction: Marcus's freezing feels slightly convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mural's literal nested layers—art within art, dreams within dreams, each discovery questioning authenticity of experience. Elena's choice to preserve mystery over certainty offers a non-literal answer about cyclical discovery and the value of wonder. The hobo nickel's alternating sleep/wake faces elegantly embody the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception—Elena notices spiral curves, acoustic harmonics, carved details that reflect her restorer's eye. Dialogue between Elena and Marcus feels natural with appropriate subtext about the garden's purpose. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("crystallizing into something tangible") that slightly exceeds established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and rhythmic control during the transformation sequence. Information density high—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("could feel," "could hear"), one paraphrase loop about choosing differently, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density during peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The acoustic garden as reality-bending space offers fresh angle on recursive awakening—sound architecture becomes the mechanism for temporal loops. Elena's choice to preserve rather than expose mystery subverts typical revelation endings. The hobo nickel as dimensional key between sleep/wake states provides specific, grounded magic.</comment>
