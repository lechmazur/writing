<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thrain's sensitivity drives concrete discovery through tactile reading of burned pages and the tapestry's shifting dragons, with her role as keeper providing clear motivation. The final understanding of her purpose—to tend echoes for the next axis shift—represents earned insight through accumulated sensory evidence, though some transitions between realizations feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through layered discoveries (tapestry, diaries, wall-whispers) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Thrain understands her purpose as echo-tender. The cost is legible in humanity's departure and her isolation as keeper, though the axis-shift concept could use clearer grounding in the middle section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The silo's verticality constrains movement and discovery sequence, while burned diary fragments and the tapestry function as micro-settings that enable key realizations. Sensory details like "bronze-quiet" air and walls "dense with listening" create atmospheric pressure that charges the final image of Thrain descending to continue her work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through discoveries that reweight understanding—from physical fragments to consciousness sliding along the displaced axis—narrowing toward Thrain's acceptance of her role. The dominant stake (preserving stories for the next cycle) gains weight through each revelation, though the middle section's abstract philosophizing briefly dilutes tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The axis displacement emerges through concrete discoveries rather than exposition, with dragons as markers creating a non-literal answer to cyclical reality shifts. The final image of Thrain descending into "bronze quiet" resonates with purpose rather than despair, though some thematic statements ("they were never meant to dream in just one direction") edge toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Thrain's tactile sensitivity ("fingers trailing along spines that remembered being trees") and selective attention to whispers and impressions. Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression, though occasional register drift ("existential axis") momentarily breaks the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression create momentum, with lines like "The world had gone bronze-quiet" doing multiple jobs efficiently. Some abstract passages ("sliding of reality's centerline that occurred in cycles too vast") and mild repetition of "bronze quiet" prevent higher scoring, but no major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human keeper role with medieval cosmology creates an non-obvious angle on apocalyptic fiction. The specific detail of reading pressure-impressions in burned paper and the axis-shift concept tied to dragon positions shows originality, though the broader frame of last-human scenarios limits full distinction.</comment>
