I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination**: This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens. The moonbeams don't steal golden light but reveal hidden truths beneath it—a pattern of accumulating revelation that builds toward the mother's understanding. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final revelation about the daughter's departure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassia's motivation as a "portrait archaeologist" who reveals hidden truths is clear and consistent. The mother's emotional progression from desperate seeking to relieved understanding shows genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "archaeology of light" metaphor that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the revealed truth about the daughter's departure reweights the photograph's meaning with clear emotional cost—the mother's tears of relief. The accumulative lens holds as moonbeams consistently reveal rather than steal. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~120 words to fully anchor the metro station setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald-tiled metro station creates atmospheric pressure, and the moonbeam jar functions as a tool constraining how truth can be revealed. The battery-powered spotlights and jade pillars effectively frame the exhibition space. Doesn't quite reach higher bands because the setting doesn't actively constrain choices beyond providing atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the daughter left—is clear and emotionally charged. The revelation that "she was already leaving" provides meaningful deepening that changes the mother's understanding. Cost is visible in the mother's emotional response, though the conflict lacks multiple pressure points typical of higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept that "beauty could lie" and "truth is more beautiful than the lie, even when it hurts." The moonbeam revelation technique perfectly embodies this thematic question. The final image of silver patterns that "would fade by dawn" resonantly answers the central question about truth versus beautiful illusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"emerald-tiled walls gleamed like scales," "amber glow from sunset photographs." The perceptual signature of someone who thinks in terms of light and its capture is consistent. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in phrases like "archaeology of light" that momentarily drift from the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Deduction for the slight conceptual loop between "portrait thief" and later clarification that she doesn't actually steal but reveals, and for occasional elevated diction ("unrepeatable golden light") that borders on overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of using moonbeams to reveal hidden emotional truths beneath golden-hour photography is genuinely original. The transformation of the "thief" concept into archaeological revelation shows sophisticated reworking of expectations. Risk-taking in the metaphysical premise pays off through specific emotional grounding.</comment>
