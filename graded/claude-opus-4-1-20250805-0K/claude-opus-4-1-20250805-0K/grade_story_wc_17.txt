<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited ability and professional duty, with concrete embodied details like pressing palms to walls and physical sensations. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (photographing before touching, placing her notebook beside Voss's), though internal contradiction could be stronger during peak discovery moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira adds her whisper to the walls' collection, accepting her role in the chain of preservation. Cost is visible in "Legacy's burden" and the weight of being the last practitioner, though the final moment could sharpen the price of this acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivy-conquered university setting actively constrains movement ("passage narrowed, forcing Mira to brush aside curtains") and provides discovery opportunities through the archive room. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the walls themselves functioning as recording devices that shape Mira's choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to discovering she's not alone in her ability to understanding her role in a larger preservation chain. The discovery of Voss's hidden archives meaningfully tightens options and forces Mira to decide whether to continue the tradition, with visible cost in accepting the burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of walls as memory vessels and the burden of preserving human experience. The final image of Mira adding her whisper offers a non-literal answer about continuity and purpose without moralizing, though "Legacy's burden" edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature of someone attuned to acoustic memories and physical vibrations. Voice modulates appropriately with discovery and maintains distinct texture, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("eternal collection") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied rhythm and purposeful information density, particularly in discovery sequences. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "eternal collection" and "green conquest," and there's slight repetition in vegetation descriptions, but clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of echo cartography and walls as memory storage offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic preservation. The synthesis of climate disaster with acoustic archaeology feels specific and earned, though the ending's philosophical framing ("ensure the future could still hear its dreams") leans slightly toward the abstract.</comment>
