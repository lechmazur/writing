<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and internal contradiction throughout, particularly in Vera's physical reactions to the perfume and her struggle with past mistakes. The transformation from brutal exorcist to collaborative participant is earned through specific sensory details and micro-choices. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("parasitic spirit") but recovers through concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Vera learns to "follow" rather than lead, completing the requiem as the orchard dies. The cost is visible in both the lost trees and Elisabetta's final dissolution. Strong causality from email summons through collaborative completion, with the perfume as persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archive setting effectively constrains choices through time pressure (chainsaws above) and provides necessary scores. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that enables the ghost connection. Sensory details (yellowed paper, bergamot, roses) are selective and purposeful, though some spatial choreography could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal reconciliation to preserving artistic legacy against the ticking clock of the orchard's destruction. The reversal—possession as collaboration rather than invasion—transforms options meaningfully. Cost is legible in the trees falling and Elisabetta's permanent departure after the requiem's completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of possession as water finding cracks, recontextualized from destructive to collaborative. The final image of sheet music written in perfume resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of "imperfect miracles" concept throughout, earning its thematic weight through specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style. Dialogue carries subtext effectively (Marcus's "You've been ripping spirits out like weeds"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("distilled memory itself") but largely maintains POV consistency. The metaphorical framing device works well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("memory itself, distilled"). Minor template cadence in the middle section. Strong opening and closing lines that anchor voice and recharge earlier motifs. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle on possession narrative through the family connection and artistic collaboration frame. The synthesis of exorcism-as-journalism with ghost-as-collaborator feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in the quiet, collaborative ending rather than dramatic confrontation serves the theme well.</comment>
