<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's methodical exploration driven by intellectual skepticism creates strong interiority, particularly in his decision to document but not disturb the valve wheel—a choice that crystallizes his values under pressure. The "drowsy alertness" and Methodist-influenced questioning establish distinctive characterization. Minor deduction for the radio voices feeling slightly orchestrated rather than organically discovered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as radio fragments and tunnel exploration layer toward Marcus's discovery and ethical choice. The Earned Stasis closure (leaving the valve wheel untouched) carries visible cost—forgoing potential fame/content for respecting the dead. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for the radio confessions feeling somewhat convenient in their clarity and timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tunnel's "sweating brick walls" and maintenance equipment "like metal tombstones" create atmospheric pressure that shapes Marcus's choices. The valve wheel's specific location "behind a rusted junction box" provides crucial spatial grounding. Setting constrains the final choice effectively. Minor deduction for some generic industrial descriptors that don't fully leverage the textile mill's specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from urban exploration curiosity to moral witness as radio confessions reveal the valve wheel's tragic significance. Marcus's choice between documenting for fame versus preserving the site creates genuine tension. The "weight of swallowed truth" lands with cost. Deduction for pressure building more through revelation than active conflict—appropriate for the lens but limits escalation ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel transforms from industrial artifact to moral touchstone, with prayer beads threading literal faith through failed machinery. "Some confessions aren't meant to be absolved. They're meant to be witnessed" resonates without moralizing. The ending reweights exploration as witness-bearing rather than conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent reflective distance with phrases like "that peculiar state between exhaustion and adrenaline" showing Marcus's analytical nature. The radio voices feel distinct from Marcus's narration. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("DNA strands") that doesn't fully match the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. "The tunnel exhaled behind him" provides evocative closure imagery. Some figurative density in places ("like DNA strands," "metal tombstones") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in the middle radio confession sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fusion of urban exploration with industrial ghost story through ham radio confessions offers a fresh angle. The beaded valve wheel as rosary-industrial hybrid is inventive. Execution stays within genre conventions without significant transformation—competent but not groundbreaking.</comment>
