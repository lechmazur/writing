<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miran's gift creates genuine internal tension between absorbing centuries of pain and walking away, with the choice earned through her "brittle surface, flexible core" nature. The transformation from chef to "vessel for fortress's sorrows" shows meaningful change with visible cost ("body heavy with purpose"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory-tasting that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memory layers build toward Miran's choice to "subsume it all" and transform stored grief into acceptance. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost ("swallowing centuries," "digested grief of ages"). Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how exactly the pavilion "conducts memories."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal pools function as setting that constrains choice—Miran must touch them to access memories, creating immediate stakes. Vivid sensory work ("salt and sorrow," "calcified regret") grounds the fantastical premise. The coral pavilion beneath drives the central decision and charges the final image of pools reflecting "stars that seemed...to shine without sorrow."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory-smoothing to absorbing centuries of collective grief, with clear cost ("emotional contagion hit her like a sandstorm"). The choice between walking away or subsuming creates genuine tension. Some softness in how the transformation mechanism works reduces full escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of digesting historical trauma and transforming it into communal healing via food. The final feast that will "taste not of regret, but of acceptance" offers a non-literal answer to processing collective grief. Slight deduction for the explicit "forgiveness" in the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through food/taste metaphors ("sandpaper memories smooth," "memories have flavor profiles"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("monument to stored remorse"). The POV's culinary lens effectively filters the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("pooling in ancient depressions that hadn't held water since before Chef Miran arrived"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("frozen scream," "tuning fork conducting sound") and abstract phrasing around the memory-absorption mechanism. Minor template cadence in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chef protagonist with memory-tasting gift applied to historical trauma creates non-obvious angle. The coral pavilion as "frozen architecture conducting memories" and tidal pools as "carefully maintained eyes" show imaginative specificity. Risk-taking in the fantastical premise heightens stakes without losing emotional grounding.</comment>
