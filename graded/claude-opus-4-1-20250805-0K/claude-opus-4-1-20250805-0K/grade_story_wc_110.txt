<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal contradiction between protecting/concealing drives both characters' choices, with embodied tension in Samuel turning the lens and Mira's slow approach creating ripples. The final choice to take hands carries visible cost of vulnerability after months of mistrust. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("relief that flooded through her") and slight therapy-speak in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught doodles, lens imagery, and whispered confessions building toward Resonant Reconfiguration where taking hands crystallizes new trust with felt cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchored early (museum, night registrar, forecourt). Minor deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally shown in the final gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt's acoustic properties actively shape the scene—whispers become music, creating intimacy that enables confession. The projector lens constrains choices as a physical reminder of their past trust. Some generic descriptions ("trapped moonlight," "spring rain") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through layered revelations: Samuel protected Marcus, Mira made corrections to muddy waters, Marcus confessed—each tightening the emotional pressure toward reconciliation. The dominant stake of trust/mistrust coheres throughout with visible cost in their three-month silence. Slightly abstract at times rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of transparency versus protection emerges through concrete actions—the lens showing things "clearly, even when they weren't," the doodles being "ambiguously clear." The final image of the lens gathering rain and moonlight equally resonates without stating a moral. Minor deduction for occasionally explicit thematic language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Mira, distinctive perceptual signature in how she reads Samuel's doodles and notices acoustic properties. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I kept it" implying deeper meaning). Some register drift into elevated literary language ("architectures of protection") not fully aligned with character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("weighted with what remained unspoken"/"silence into something almost musical" near "resonant hush"). Template phrases like "relief that flooded through her" and abstract emotional labeling reduce immediacy. The recurring "ambiguously clear" works as pattern but other repetitions feel redundant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cryptic doodle communication system offers fresh specificity—spirals within squares, arrows pointing nowhere, clock faces without hands. The acoustic forecourt as confession space shows originality. However, the core mistrust-to-reconciliation arc follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
