I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal lens** - the narrative operates through clear because/therefore linkages, with Marcus's discovery of his true nature driving each subsequent revelation and choice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from fearful stunt double to weaponized creation shows strong internal contradiction acting in scene, particularly in "You gave me the perfect defense" where his programmed fears become tactical advantages. The final choice to leave Jake suffering his transferred phobias demonstrates earned causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic label-speak ("identity reconstruction protocols") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Marcus reverses the shell's resonance to transfer his fears to Jake, with clear on-page cost as Jake collapses "overwhelmed by terrors he'd never learned to navigate." The causal chain from child's cast → library coordinates → confrontation → reversal holds cleanly. Who/where/when anchored early ("Marcus pressed his scarred palm against the rusted library door").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library with collapsed roof sections creates atmospheric pressure, and the seashell constrains Marcus's choices throughout. "Stars pierced through the collapsed roof sections where decades of rain had eaten through steel and ambition" effectively merges setting with thematic decay. The shells' physical reunion triggers the climactic reversal, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds causally from discovery (cast equations) → revelation (synthetic identity) → confrontation → reversal where Marcus weaponizes his programmed limitations. The cost is legible when Jake experiences the transferred fears he never learned to navigate. "Vulnerability is power" crystallizes as Marcus transforms his engineered weaknesses into weapons, though the reversal mechanism could be clearer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete reversal of "vulnerability is power" - Marcus's programmed fears become his strength precisely because he learned to function through them. The mother's revenge encoded in her daughter's cast adds layered betrayal. Final image of Marcus walking out "firmly adaptive as always" reweights his fears as weapons, though some thematic statements feel slightly explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with evocative phrasing like "metal's chill seep through his skin like a promise" and "a sound like grinding metal." POV remains stable in close third. Dialogue serves multiple functions - Jake's "A stunt double seemed poetic" reveals cruel calculation while advancing plot. Minor register drift in technical passages ("synthetic memory compounds") that briefly breaks voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("decades of rain had eaten through steel and ambition"). Some density issues with figurative language clustering in emotional beats. Template cadence appears in "Marcus wasn't Marcus. He wasn't even human" structure. Information density high when describing the reversal sequence, though the mechanism could be clearer without sacrificing atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of identity horror with stunt double profession - the meta-layer of someone who performs as others discovering he's himself a performance. The reversal where programmed weaknesses become weapons through lived experience transforms the betrayal trope. "Firmly adaptive" gains new meaning by closure. Some familiar elements (memory manipulation, created beings) but combined in non-obvious ways.</comment>
