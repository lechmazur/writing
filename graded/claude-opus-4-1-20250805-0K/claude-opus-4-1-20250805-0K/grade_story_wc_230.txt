<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's compulsion to truth creates genuine internal pressure through embodied confession ("I smuggled this," "I haven't slept properly"), and her final choice to distribute cure selectively shows earned wisdom about truth's dignity. The contradiction between involuntary truthfulness and chosen discretion drives meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through ravine descent, truffle discovery, and cure synthesis, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara gains agency to "speak sideways" with explicit cost acknowledged ("different burden"). The hanging orchard's sideways growth metaphor charges the final image of humanity learning to "bend truth without breaking it."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard's steel cables and horizontal trees create a visceral environment that mirrors the story's central tension about adaptation. Setting constrains action through storm-bent branches catching the rake and provides the specific mycelium needed for cure, making environment essential to resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal suffering through involuntary truth to broader social reconstruction, with Mara's agency driving the cure discovery and synthesis. The cost is explicit: choosing when truth emerges creates "a different burden" of discretion versus compulsion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sideways-growing trees offer a resonant non-literal answer to surviving truth's tyranny—adaptation without surrender. Theme emerges through concrete particulars (glass eye seeing "past veils," truffle cure, hanging orchard) rather than abstractions, with the final image reweighting all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective detail ("verdigris," "mortar and pestle") though occasional overwriting appears ("fractured grace," "hanged men"). POV control is solid with no head-hopping, but some filter constructions ("she watched") slightly dull immediacy during key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("glass eye rolled between Mara's fingers") but suffers from occasional density issues with multiple metaphors per sentence and some register elevation ("blessed silence in her throat"). Template cadence appears in middle exposition about the virus's effects, though line-level craft improves at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The empathy virus creating involuntary truthfulness offers fresh speculation on pandemic aftermath, while the Victorian cure through truffle and glass eye creates unexpected synthesis. The sideways orchard metaphor for human adaptation feels earned and specific rather than convenient.</comment>
