<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is crystal clear—painting possibilities to reach her comatose daughter through dream-maps. The "borrowed heartbeat" creates genuine internal contradiction between urgency and necessary calm. The final choice to set down the brush with "infinite grace" while "trembling only slightly" embodies earned restraint with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered paintings, coded songs, and the sparrow's transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the sparrow sings Sophia's lullaby back, making the "borrowed heartbeat growing stronger" a felt cost of Maya's artistic vigil. The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and causality tracks through Maya's deliberate pattern of leaving painted messages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prism parapet constrains Maya's artistic choices—she must paint while "rainbow fragments" remain trapped in crystal. The terrace's echo amplifies every sound, making her coded lullabies carry further. Setting actively participates when the sparrow lands on the specific prism parapet to sing back, though occupational painting details could deepen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching Sophia through painted possibilities—faces one meaningful tightening when the sparrow transforms from observer to messenger. Cost is visible in Maya's "borrowed heartbeat" quickening and doubling. However, escalation remains gentle without a decisive foreclusion of options or forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of painting "possibilities, not realities" and bending light through prisms. The final image of "mirrors she'd taught to dream" resonantly answers whether art can bridge consciousness without stating a moral. Subtext operates beautifully in the coded lullabies and the cathedral bells' mysterious jamming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature is distinct—she sees "rainbow fragments trapped" and paints "dusky harmony" between states. Voice modulates effectively from calm observation to urgent creation. The brief dialogue (sung lullabies) carries crucial subtext about finding doors "painted spring," though more varied syntax under pressure would elevate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most lines advance both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak beats ("sweet and golden" taffy metaphor) slightly slows propulsion, and "infinite grace" borders on overwriting, but no loops or scaffolding appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of painting dream-maps to reach a comatose child offers a fresh angle on grief and hope. The specific synthesis of "mirage painter" with actual metaphysical purpose transforms the archetype. However, the resolution's optimism (sparrow singing back) chooses a safer middle path rather than confronting harder costs.</comment>
