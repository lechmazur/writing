I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered symbols, weather codes, and the recurring motif of "necessary distances" rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to decode her father's disappearance is clear and embodied through specific actions like tracing grain patterns and following weather codes. The internal contradiction between accepting loss and seeking connection drives genuine tension. However, the final whisper lacks the visceral cost needed for 8+ range—we see recognition but not the full weight of choosing to engage with absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's discovery that love itself is "a necessary distance we're always crossing," with the threshold serving as a physical manifestation of this concept. The cost is conceptually present but not fully dramatized—we understand Marina chooses to inhabit liminal space like her father, but the immediate price of this choice remains abstract. The accumulative structure coheres well through weather codes and grain patterns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The corn maze and observation terrace function as more than setting—they embody the story's central metaphor of necessary distances and constrain Marina's navigation through weather codes. The spiral grain patterns in wood matching the maze design creates meaningful spatial coherence. The sacred circle's temperature differential providing a "permanent pressure differential" directly charges the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding why certain spaces feel sacred, with pressure building through Marina's navigation of the maze using her father's codes. The discovery of the threshold represents meaningful deepening rather than reversal. However, the resolution lacks immediate dramatic tension—Marina's choice to whisper back needs higher cost visibility to reach the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of atmospheric pressure differentials representing emotional and existential thresholds. The concept that "love itself is a necessary distance" resonates without explicit moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract articulation of "sacred geometry of loss and return" which edges toward theme-statement rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("featherly determined," "fractured hush"). The POV filters details through Marina's inherited understanding of weather patterns and sacred geometries. Some phrases like "sacred geometry of loss and return" drift toward elevated register that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "corn whispered in fractured hush" and maintains good rhythm variation. However, several abstract formulations weaken immediacy: "sacred geometry of loss and return," "atmospheric pressure of a daughter's love," and repetitive use of "necessary distance" without variation. The filter verb "felt" appears at crucial moments where more direct sensation would strengthen impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a weather-mapped corn maze as portal between presence and absence offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of meteorology, sacred geometry, and emotional topology creates an original constellation. The specific detail of "three degrees cooler" temperature differential as threshold marker grounds the mystical in scientific precision.</comment>
