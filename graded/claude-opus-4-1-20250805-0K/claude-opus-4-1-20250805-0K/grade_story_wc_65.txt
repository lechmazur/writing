<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique philosophy of mapping ignorance rather than knowledge, with her internal conflict between direct confrontation and subtle manipulation playing out through concrete actions. The character's choice to embed "controlled chaos" through visual algorithms shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though the Council members remain somewhat stock despite their brief individualized descriptions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise, where the Council unknowingly adopts revolutionary ideas they believe are their own, with the cost being Mira's invisibility and the irony that transformation requires deception. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns and visual algorithms accumulate pressure toward the crystallized ending where "everything became possible," though the transformation happens somewhat quickly for the word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Obsidian Spire functions as more than setting—its non-reflective darkness mirrors Mira's invisible influence, while the frozen lake and kingfisher imagery create a coherent metaphor for seeing beneath surfaces. The maps themselves become micro-settings that constrain and enable choices, though some occupational detail about the Council's actual work remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mira's personal creative philosophy to systemic transformation of innovation culture, with the tension between "rigid frameworks" and "controlled chaos" driving the conflict. The cost is legible in Mira's acceptance of anonymity—she wins by disappearing—though the Council's transformation feels slightly too smooth given their established rigidity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through evolution rather than revolution emerges organically from the concrete action of embedding visual algorithms, with the final image of footprints "writing new paths across ancient ice" offering a resonant non-literal answer. The story resists simple binaries between order and chaos, instead proposing "controlled chaos" and "teaching systems to dream."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature is distinct—she sees voids, blank spaces, and possibilities where others see boundaries, with prose rhythm accelerating during her map-creation sequences. The brief dialogue maintains naturalism while the narrative voice modulates effectively between philosophical reflection and concrete action, though the Council members' voices aren't fully distinguished.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "darkness cannot darken what already gleams black" doing multiple jobs, though some passages drift into elevated register ("visual symphonies of probability"). Minor template cadence appears in the Council description sequence ("The engineer who... The botanist whose... The programmer who...") but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of "ignorance cartographer" offers a genuinely fresh angle on creativity and innovation, with the specific synthesis of mapping voids rather than territories feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk of making transformation invisible and evolutionary rather than revolutionary heightens the stakes and adds +0.3 within band for unconventional approach to change narrative.</comment>
