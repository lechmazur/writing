<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to gather fragments and teach others feels earned through his unique temporal perception as a borrowed-time timekeeper. The final choice to "step into uncertain chronology" carries visible cost—accepting a world without numerical certainty. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional states ("sticky tar of grief") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Marcus understanding his purpose to help humanity adapt to experiential chronology. The cost is legible: living in a world where time cannot be counted, only felt. The progression from discovery to understanding to acceptance coheres well, though the middle could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo's crystalline walls and rust-colored horizon establish a vivid post-temporal world. Setting constrains choice when Marcus must physically touch the silo to feel time's vibrations. The "texture of time" concept (sandpaper anxiety, silk contentment) effectively merges setting with theme, though some descriptions remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal search to humanity's survival in a post-numerical world. The deepening occurs when Marcus discovers the urn fragment contains part of Voss's consciousness and solution. Cost is clear: accepting borrowed time and teaching others means living outside conventional chronology forever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the garage sale messages—everyday objects carrying desperate warnings about temporal collapse. The final image of Marcus stepping into "uncertain chronology" resonantly answers how humanity adapts when numbers fail. The cremation urn fragment as distributed consciousness avoids abstraction through concrete detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive concepts like "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "the Great Uncounting." POV remains stable with Marcus throughout. Some register elevation in explanatory passages ("temporal anomaly," "experiential chronology") slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon during crisis moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cracked like an egg," "emerald frequency"). Information density high in the garage sale advertisements. Deductions for repetitive "understood" constructions and some abstract phrasing around time's texture that could be more concrete. Minor scaffold in exposition about Voss's plan.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time capsule and garage sale concepts to explore temporal collapse. The idea of consciousness fragments hidden in mundane classified ads shows genuine ingenuity. The "borrowed-time timekeeper" living on temporal credit creates an original perspective on chronology, though execution occasionally relies on abstract description.</comment>
