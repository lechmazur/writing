<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to restore beauty through music is clear and consistent, with embodied tension between knowing the cost and pursuing transformation. The statues' dual nature (mechanical surface/buried hearts) creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of discovering the locust shell "three dawns ago" without showing how this discovery specifically triggered today's action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through musical intensification toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard transforms with visible cost (approaching enforcement squadrons, Lira "playing herself empty"). The locust shell metaphor of transformation through abandonment effectively charges the closure. Minor deduction for not fully dramatizing what "becoming the shell another's freedom might require" means for Lira specifically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard setting actively constrains choices through its mechanized state and statue patrols. Strong sensory work with the "iron lattice humming with industrial frequencies" and trees "welded into productive angles." The bridge as liminal performance space works well. Setting transformation mirrors thematic arc effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from personal risk (playing forbidden music) through statue awakening to full orchard rebellion with enforcement squadrons approaching. The music's effect deepens from causing confusion to shattering clockwork hearts to trees uprooting themselves. Cost is visible in Lira "playing herself empty" and the approaching consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of beauty versus efficiency emerges organically through the orchard's transformation and the locust shell's metamorphosis metaphor. The ending achieves resonance without stating a moral, as promised liberation requires self-sacrifice ("becoming the shell"). Strong integration of art as resistance without becoming preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("metronomic time," "binary programming") fits the mechanized world. Deduction for occasional register drift into abstraction ("imperfection's grace," "beauty that served no purpose except its own existence") that pulls away from Lira's immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("something stirred in her chest," "remembering gentle") and some repetitive constructions around "began to" that slightly dull momentum. The final paragraph contains philosophical abstraction that weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-resistance with the specific mechanism of matching buried heart rhythms to break mechanical programming. The locust shell as metaphor for necessary abandonment adds originality. Some familiar dystopian elements (Mechanization Council, beauty declared inefficient) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
