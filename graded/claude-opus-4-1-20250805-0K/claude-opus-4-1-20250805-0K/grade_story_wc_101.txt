<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's evolution from individual charity to orchestrator of communal dignity shows strong character-driven causality with embodied details like "weathered hands paused on the bell rope." The final cost—her exhaustion and transfer of responsibility—lands concretely. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("creating dignity") and the slightly convenient perfection of the community's transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout as midnight rituals layer into communal transformation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when anonymous giving becomes "their very identity." Cost is visible in Marta's exhaustion and the community's unified silence against officials. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression of food distribution expanding without sufficient friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and silver bell constrain choices effectively—the midnight timing structures all exchanges, and the arbor becomes "their silent marketplace of dignity." Sensory details like "shadows would emerge from every corner" create atmosphere. Missing higher bands because some details remain generic (rice, beans, plums) rather than culturally specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual survival through communal exchange to confronting government officials, with the bell ritual providing coherent pressure throughout. The cost of maintaining anonymity ("need has no face") shapes tactics meaningfully. Slightly weakened by the too-smooth progression where "something had shifted" without showing sufficient intermediate struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bell's transformation from survival tool to celebration, with "a thousand quiet acts of midnight grace" crystallizing the dignity-through-anonymity concept. The final image of the bell's echo living "in every heartbeat below" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, though one instance of theme-speak ("benevolent shadows") slightly diminishes impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal register with selective details like "terra-cotta arbor" and "antique silver bell" creating texture. Dialogue feels natural ("From someone who remembers hunger"). Some filter verb clusters ("she discovered," "she found") and occasional register elevation ("benevolent shadows") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm, particularly strong in "The bell fell silent, but its echo lived on in every heartbeat below." Several instances of abstract phrasing ("survival required more than just endurance") and mild redundancy ("unified silence" after showing silence) create drag. Information density is generally good but occasionally lapses into summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The anonymous midnight charity system offers a fresh angle on community resilience, with the specific detail of maintaining donor anonymity to preserve dignity. The transformation is earned through accumulated detail rather than twist. Loses points for somewhat familiar refugee narrative framework and the convenient tidiness of the resolution.</comment>
