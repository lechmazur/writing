<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between mercy and justified vengeance plays out through concrete micro-choices, particularly her decision to share the drawer pull with Thorne. The final act of accepting his apology "as down payment" shows earned complexity with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around forgiveness that borders on diagnostic clarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the drawer pull accumulating meaning across beats until the final "waiting for the darkness that would make them all equal" resonantly reconfigures the opening weight. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost in Elara's acceptance of future healing. The moon phases structure provides coherent escalation through ritual timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parapet setting actively constrains the encounter as neutral territory "where empires met but never touched," and the mist creates tactical pressure by limiting visibility. The drawer pull functions effectively as micro-setting that charges the final image. Some atmospheric description tends toward the generic ("storm-worn," "wind and war").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the reveal of Thorne's son among prisoners, the apology exchange, and the drawer pull ritual, each tightening moral pressure. The cost is legible in "Both were wrong. Both were young. Both deserve the chance to transform their errors into understanding." Agency manifests through Elara's choice to share wisdom rather than exact revenge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grandmother's story paralleling current events—"recycled her mistake into wisdom." The moon phase metaphor (waning/waxing/new) provides non-literal resonance without stating morals. Final image of "waiting for the darkness that would make them all equal" reweights the entire exchange without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled formality matching the diplomatic tension ("anchored her to this moment," "furrowed hush"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Thorne's "You received my letter" carrying unspoken apology. Some register elevation in peak moments ("uncommonly thoughtful") slightly strains POV consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong opening ("weighed nothing...yet it anchored her") and closing images. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "wisdom" and "mistakes," plus some abstract constructions ("choreography of redemption") that slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drawer pull as inherited talisman of prisoner exchanges offers a fresh angle on diplomatic negotiation. The moon phase system for exchanges shows originality. However, the core reconciliation arc follows familiar patterns without significant transformation, and some thematic statements feel safely middle-ground.</comment>
