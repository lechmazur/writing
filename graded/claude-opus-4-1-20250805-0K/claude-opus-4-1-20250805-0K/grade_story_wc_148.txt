I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages as Marcus discovers truth through his father's journals, leading to his testimony that transforms the confessional lattice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in inherited imprisonment and the need to clear his father's name. The internal progression from passive acceptance to active truth-seeking is earned through the journal discovery. Minor deduction for some telling rather than showing of emotional states ("Marcus smiled") and slightly convenient timing of discoveries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery to testimony, with clear closure as Marcus transforms the confessional into a testament. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (his continued imprisonment while proving innocence). Orientation anchors established early. Minor deduction for some convenience in the warden's suicide timing and the preservation of evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting constrains choices effectively - the ajar door, the confessional lattice, and copper light all participate in the closure. Sensory details like "salt air had turned green" and "scuffed by desperate fingernails" create atmosphere. The hovering ability integrates well with the impossibility theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal vindication to exposing systemic injustice, with the supply boat deadline creating urgency. The dominant stake (proving truth before discovery) tightens through Marcus's choice to testify rather than escape. Cost is visible in his acceptance of continued imprisonment for truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the labyrinth metaphor - truth requiring navigation through lies. The confession booth's transformation from "cruel joke" to testament resonates. "Truth lives in the spaces between heartbeats" pays off in Marcus's final hover between imprisonment and vindication. The inherited curse becoming inherited mission adds depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains fairy-tale register appropriately ("Devil's Tooth Reef," "Marcus True-Tongue"). POV stable with controlled psychic distance. Some moments of elevated diction ("amber repose") fit the mythic tone. Minor deduction for occasional telling over showing and some filter phrases that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with strong imagery like "hover-carved itself into the wood." Some repetitive structures ("Marcus understood," "Marcus began," "Marcus smiled") create mild template cadence. The "copper light" motif works well. Minor overwriting in places ("defying gravity as casually as logic").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy tale with prison gothic creates originality. The hovering as manifestation of impossible existence is inventive. The reversal of the boy who cried wolf legacy through generational vindication offers a non-obvious angle. Transformation of confession booth from joke to justice instrument shows ingenuity.</comment>
