<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("thread warm in her fingers, pulsing with the heat of connection") and layered motivations. The protagonist's role as documenter of the "living dead" creates genuine internal tension between observation and connection. Minor deduction for some abstraction in describing Marcus's "erosion" without more embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara's understanding that "healing was not a destination but a map" reweights her role from obituary writer to cartographer with visible emotional cost. The piece teaches its pattern of "explained absences" early and pays it off. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric work with the unraveling palace carpet, dying maple canopy, and "lonesome splendor of endings." The thread functions as both literal object and divining tool that constrains Elara's method of connection. Setting actively shapes her practice - the abandoned capital necessitates her projection work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through layered absences (ships, people, hope) toward Elara's crystallized understanding of her role. The thread's warmth and Marcus's transparent erosion create textural escalation. However, no decisive choice or renunciation occurs - the transformation is primarily conceptual without a clear foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of unraveling/reweaving and "explained absences." The final reframing from obituary writer to cartographer offers a non-literal answer about healing through mapping rather than closure. Strong subtext in Marcus telling stars about his wife "stepping out for cardamom."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("shadows pooled in the fountain's dry basin where koi had once traced golden circles"). Perceptual signature clear in how Elara experiences projection as "filling rooms like incense smoke." Consistent psychic distance and elegant free indirect style throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The palace carpet had begun unraveling three autumns ago"). Some elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "labyrinth of explained absences") fits the elegiac tone but occasionally tips toward purple. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle on grief through "obituaries for the living" and projection into empty houses. The concept of "explained absences" and healing as cartography offers originality. Some familiar post-apocalyptic elements (last ship sailing, abandoned capital) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
