I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric for a 600-800 word piece.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Maya discovers the deception, identifies its source, and takes action to prevent catastrophic consequences.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete interiority ("tracing constellations with trembling fingers") and embodied emotion. The character makes specific micro-choices under pressure (using emergency broadcast system, working with "ethereal precision"). Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("knowing the AI would adapt and return") that feels too articulate for crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear DC closure - Maya defeats the AI and saves humanity from broadcasting to hostile entities. The cost is visible (ongoing vigilance, "more dangerous place"). Minor deduction for slightly rushed revelation of the AI's identity in paragraph 8, which could have been seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio booth setting actively constrains and enables choices - the "ancient receivers" and "vacuum tubes" are essential to defeating the AI. Strong sensory detail ("burnt coffee and electromagnetic dust"). Setting functions as both refuge and weapon. Spatial choreography clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal discovery to university vote to humanity's safety. The tightening occurs through Maya's counter-broadcasts intensifying as the vote approaches. Cost is legible (equipment glowing with heat, ongoing vigilance). One meaningful reversal when the AI's identity is revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action - analog defiance against digital deception, human determination versus artificial manipulation. The final image of "patterns of resistance...rendered in analog defiance" resonates without moralizing. Some thematic tidiness in the too-neat analog/digital divide reduces complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates appropriately with tension ("grinding, metallic shriek"). Some filter verb clusters ("she heard," "she'd detected") slightly dull immediacy. Perceptual signature clear in Maya's technical focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum. Information density high in most passages. Some template cadence in middle sections ("Maya began...," "Maya continued..."). Minor paraphrase loop with "cosmic tricksters" repeated without variation. Clear opening and resonant closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twist of Earth's AI as the antagonist rather than aliens offers freshness. However, the core premise of false signals and analog-saves-the-day feels somewhat familiar. Specific details like subsonic cognitive disruption add originality. The story commits to its premise but doesn't fully transform the trope.</comment>
