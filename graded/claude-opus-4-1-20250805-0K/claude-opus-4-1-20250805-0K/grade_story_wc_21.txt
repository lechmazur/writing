I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal blend), with accumulative dominant at closure through the layered revelation of truth's complexity.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amara's retrocognitive trap creates genuine internal conflict between preserving myth and revealing truth, with embodied vertigo and trembling hands grounding the abstract. The final choice to transcribe "knowing that truth and tension were not opposites but partners" shows earned wisdom through specific struggle, though Marcus's characterization relies more on symbolic function than individual complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Amara's understanding that "real encryption had never been in the diary's symbols but in the courage required to face the full truth," with visible cost in the "stories that hurt and healed in equal measure." The retrocognitive device strains causality slightly—the mechanism for how touching pages triggers temporal overlap lacks grounding—but the accumulative build toward truth's complexity lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both literal setting and metaphorical mirror, constraining choice through its hidden location and charging the final image as "a mirror, reflecting back the complex beauty of struggle across time." The zeppelin archive creates vertical distance that literalizes perspective, while the arranged debris becomes a physical cipher that shapes the revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether revealing compromising truths will destroy the movement's legacy, with escalation through the progression from encrypted diary to temporal trap to physical pilgrimage. The tension between "truth creates tension" and preserving the "movement's myth" drives meaningful pressure, though the resolution arrives through explanation rather than dramatized choice, limiting the felt cost of Amara's decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between historical truth and useful myth, with the lagoon-as-mirror providing resonant imagery for how "love and betrayal had been inseparable in their struggle." The final insight about courage being the real encryption reweights the entire piece, though some thematic articulation ("truth and tension were not opposites but partners") edges toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the archival perspective, with selective perception focused on documents, symbols, and historical weight. Dialogue between Amara and Marcus serves the conceptual exchange but lacks naturalistic texture—"The truth creates tension" reads more as thematic articulation than organic speech, though this fits the story's allegorical mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of resonant imagery ("obsidian lagoon reflected the zeppelin above, creating an infinity of floating libraries") but suffers from abstract scaffolding and conceptual redundancy. Lines like "knowing who is different from understanding why" and variations on truth/tension appear multiple times without advancing pressure, creating paraphrase loops that slow momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap allowing simultaneous existence across timelines offers fresh narrative possibility, while the floating archive above a hidden desert lagoon creates memorable worldbuilding. The synthesis of civil rights history with speculative elements feels purposeful rather than ornamental, transforming familiar historical material through the specific lens of archival preservation and temporal overlap.</comment>
