<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mariel's seasonal muteness creates authentic constraint that shapes her relationship to the bells, and her choice to sacrifice the irreplaceable fragment shows clear cost. The internal conflict between preservation methods builds naturally to the decisive action, though some emotional embodiment during the melting could deepen the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the iceberg's melting creating genuine urgency that forces action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where wonder becomes permanently encoded in bronze. The cost is visible—the last physical fragment dissolves completely—and the transformation of all bells creates clear before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choice effectively through its bell configurations and wind-activated mechanism, while the cloud-wreathed height isolates the action appropriately. Sensory detail of "turquoise threads spiraled through metal" and "golden motes" grounds the fantastical transformation in specific perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The melting iceberg creates legitimate time pressure that escalates from preservation attempts to the decisive sacrifice, with clear cost in losing the last physical piece of pre-change world. The stakes deepen when Mariel realizes the bells can hold what refrigeration cannot, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder emerges beautifully through the concrete action of encoding it into bronze bells, avoiding abstraction. The final image of children lifting faces to rediscover marvel resonates without moralizing, and the concept of truth existing "at frequencies beyond speech" enriches rather than explains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mariel's selective perception focuses appropriately on tactile and visual elements of her craft, with her muteness creating interesting narrative constraint. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("gossamer of curiosity") that slightly tensions against the otherwise grounded voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though phrases like "truth dressed in amazement" and "gossamer of curiosity" edge toward purple in peak moments. The recurring "glistening" effectively transforms from ice property to bell quality, and most sentences advance multiple story functions efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of seasonal muteness in a post-language world offers fresh perspective on communication, and encoding wonder into bells through melting ice shows genuine invention. The transformation could push further—the resolution feels slightly safe despite the imaginative premise.</comment>
