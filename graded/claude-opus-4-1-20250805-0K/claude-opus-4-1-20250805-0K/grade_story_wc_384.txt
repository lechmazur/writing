<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's internal contradiction between duty to her family's vengeance tradition and desire for freedom plays out through concrete choices, particularly the burning of both documents. The cost of her final choice—exposing herself through confession—is visible and earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change as Mei breaks the generational chain by choosing truth over forgery, with visible cost in her self-exposure. The causal lens holds throughout, with the grandmother's teachings and brother's forgiveness driving toward the final confession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary's marble columns, aurora light, and dripping stalactites create atmospheric pressure while the altar and key constrain choices. The setting actively participates in the revelation moment when the key reveals the grandmother's message in the marble.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from impersonal forgeries to her brother's life, with clear tightening when she must choose between condemnation and salvation documents. The cost of her final choice—exposing twenty years of work—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "calibrated treason against one's own nature" emerges through Mei's transformation from perpetuating to ending the family tradition. The final image of her genuine signature mattering more than forgeries offers resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality with selective perception focused on tools, light, and inherited objects. Some filter verbs ("Mei understood," "she remembered") slightly dull immediacy in middle passages, though the perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some passages lean toward tell over show ("For twenty years, Mei had wisely endured..."). Minor template cadence in "She had forged... created... destroyed" sequence, but momentum sustains through to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of forgery as inherited resistance offers a fresh angle, with the grandmother's hidden message providing an earned reversal. The specific detail of calligraphy tools as weapons and the dual document choice elevates familiar betrayal themes.</comment>
