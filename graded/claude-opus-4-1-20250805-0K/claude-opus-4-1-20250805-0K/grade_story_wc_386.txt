<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to "weave truth carefully from fragmented messages" drives her specific actions throughout, with the chemist ghost's materialization earned by prior established connection patterns. The protagonist demonstrates contradictory impulses (treasure-hunter turned voice-seeker) acting in scene, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during the transcription moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina accepts her role as "salvage artist of impossible things" with the cost of perpetual diving into dangerous wrecks made explicit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of ghost appearances building toward the formula revelation, though the twelve globes expansion slightly dilutes the singular focus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine's ice walls that "caught candlelight like borrowed starlight" actively constrain Marina's perception—she must read frost patterns at specific angles to decode the formula. The melted plastic edges cutting through diving gloves and candlelight creating constellation maps demonstrate environment shaping tactics and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: whispers→frost faces→visions→chemist materialization→formula revelation, with Marina's recognition that "every wreck she'd explored had been practice" foreclosing her option to refuse this calling. The cost of perpetual dangerous diving is legible, though the middle section's dream-cameo exposition slightly dampens pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete action of salvaging the antidote formula from melted plastic—"even in destruction, something pure could be salvaged"—without stating a moral. The final image of Marina carrying "borrowed starlight in her hands" resonantly answers the central question about connection between worlds through physical artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV maintains distinct perceptual signature through Marina's diver-specific lens ("three hundred feet below," "rusted portholes") and her unique ability to read ghost communications others cannot perceive. Voice modulates effectively from technical diving details to lyrical "borrowed starlight," though some passages like "salvage artist of impossible things" edge toward writerly declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("frost patterns on ice walls, their faces emerging and receding like breath on glass") with strong information density. However, template cadence appears in the chemist's dialogue section ("There are...Hidden in...Each holds") and some abstract declarations ("humanity will need") lack embodiment, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of ghosts communicating through strangers' dreams worldwide to expose a hidden antidote transforms the ghost-story trope through specific mechanism. The melted snow globe preserving chemical formulas in its warped plastic pattern offers genuine freshness, though the twelve-globes expansion feels somewhat derivative of quest narratives.</comment>
