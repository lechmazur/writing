<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between loss and artistic impulse drives the closure choice with visible cost ("bearing both worlds"). The twenty-three years of silence embodying her damaged fingers creates earned causality for accepting the teaching position. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heavy and unchanging") rather than fully embodied states in middle passages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through sensory accumulation (crystal whispers, petrichor, light patterns) toward Elara's decision to "bear both worlds" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost of splitting her life. The closure lands with "dreams that had changed shape but never truly died," showing transformation's price. Slight deduction for the middle section's reliance on backstory summary rather than present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline forecourt constrains choice through its "soundless sanctuary" nature - Elara's decision must navigate between silence and symphony. Sensory detail (petrichor triggering memory, crystal whispers) charges the final image. The sanctuary functions as both refuge and prison, shaping her compromise solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The letter creates pressure that forces Elara to confront her loss, with escalation through memory accumulation leading to her decision to "bear both worlds." Cost is visible in splitting her time between sanctuary and Conservatory. However, the conflict lacks present-scene opposition - mostly internal reflection without external pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of loss into evolution: "Her accident hadn't ended her relationship with music; it had forced it to evolve." The final image of "silence itself could sing" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the priest's wisdom feeling somewhat planted rather than fully organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through musical metaphors in non-musical contexts ("crystalline tiles hummed," "patterns that seemed almost musical"). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical descriptions. Some filter verb accumulation ("She remembered," "she understood") dulls immediacy in reflection passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("glacial hush that preceded true morning") with good rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "balm and prison"/"protecting...ensuring" restate similar protection/limitation ideas. Template cadence appears in "She would accept...she would also remain...She would bear" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of damaged pianist becoming composition teacher through silence offers a non-obvious transformation of the artist-injury trope. The specific detail of "excruciatingly gentle touch" serving quill work shows originality. Some safety in the resolution - accepting both worlds rather than choosing creates less risk.</comment>
