I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered details about memory, documentation, and the recovery of erased histories rather than through causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stationer's motivation to document erased histories is consistently embodied through concrete actions—her careful charting of frequencies, the gold-leafed petals, the patient listening. The character's "earnestly studious" nature manifests in specific gestures like "crouched beside the fountain's edge" and "cramped, careful script," though internal contradiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulation—the final image of returning "to collect more frequencies, more forgotten truths" reweights the opening's purpose with earned understanding. The cost is legible in "fingers ached from writing" and the patient, solitary work against erasure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth functions as more than setting—the trees literally "remember everything" in their scars and growth patterns, constraining how the stationer must work (listening, charting frequencies through water). The miniature forests create both physical space and conceptual framework for the story's exploration of layered time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from documenting histories to revealing specific erasures (the denied fire, the Chinese princess), culminating in the monk's silent acknowledgment that "the trees knew better." The physical cost appears in aching fingers and the patience required for this solitary work against institutional denial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete work of recovery—"invented histories in her notepad were not fiction but recovery." The final image of trees remembering "even if no one else did" offers a non-literal answer about institutional memory versus living truth without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through specialized attention to frequencies, modulations, and electromagnetic patterns—a scientific precision applied to mystical work. The controlled, formal register fits the stationer's methodical nature, though occasional phrases like "absorbed into the valley's throat" show purposeful elevation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains momentum with purposeful density, though some metaphorical reaches strain ("valley's throat," "manuscript written in living wood"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both the physical action and conceptual framework. Minor repetition around "frequencies" and "histories" could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of using electromagnetic frequencies from a fluorescent lamp to read temporal signatures in moisture is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of scientific method with mystical purpose, embodied in the "gilded-leaf stationer" profession, transforms the familiar "keeper of forbidden knowledge" trope through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
