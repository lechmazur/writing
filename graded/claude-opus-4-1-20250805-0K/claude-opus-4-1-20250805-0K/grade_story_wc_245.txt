I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous rubric for a 600-800 word piece.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered languages, sensory experiences, and symbolic resonances that build toward the stillpoint revelation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift, with concrete embodied details like "Portuguese flooded through her skin like warm honey." The transformation from seeker to embodiment of the stillpoint is earned through accumulated sensory experiences. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "uncharted emotional depths" that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes "the compass others would follow," with clear cost in her blindness-as-gift revelation. The accumulative structure coheres well through language-gathering that builds to the stillpoint discovery. The closure lands with "she had become the compass" showing decisive transformation with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions brilliantly as both setting and mechanism, with trees speaking "frequencies that bypassed ears entirely, resonating directly with bones and blood." The sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's blindness perfectly through tactile and sonic detail. Setting constrains her journey method and enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation of languages leading to the stillpoint, with clear escalation as "the platinum compass ring grew warmer" and the melody strengthens. The cost is elegantly rendered in understanding "why she'd been born blind." One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the melody "wasn't leading her somewhere—it was teaching her to become the destination."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of emotional cartography and "territories others couldn't perceive." The final realization that "sight would have distracted from this deeper seeing" offers resonant closure without moralizing. The recurring compass imagery effectively charges the transformation from seeker to guide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression and controlled rhythm, particularly in "the pause of shifting constellations, in that breath between stellar movements." Some elevated diction ("ultrasonic architecture") occasionally drifts from embodied perception. Strong perceptual signature through blind navigation and tactile language-absorption.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some abstract phrases like "vast territories of what people carried inside" and "quiet blaze of revelation" edge toward purple prose. Minor repetition of "ultrasonic forest" and some synonym cycling around emotional/uncharted/depths. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a blind mapmaker who absorbs languages through touch to navigate emotional territories is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of sensory compensation, linguistic absorption, and emotional cartography creates something memorable. The ultrasonic forest existing "across the pause of shifting constellations" shows bold imaginative reach.</comment>
