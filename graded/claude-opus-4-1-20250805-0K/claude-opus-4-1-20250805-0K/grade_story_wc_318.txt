I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and his "mournfully eager" state creates genuine internal contradiction. The Hendricks family's grief is embodied through specific cessations (Emma's singing, father's whistling). The transformation from grief to laughter feels earned through Marcus's ritualistic action, though Emma's final laugh could use more embodied resistance before breakthrough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the restoration of laughter through Marcus's symphony creates a Decisive Change with visible cost (three years of silence broken). The piece teaches its magical realism early ("laughter leaves echoes") and pays it off. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The "mournfully eager" repetition bookends effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as more than setting—it's the mechanism enabling transformation through its echo properties and ventilation shafts. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (leaf blowers' specific notes, pull cords "gleaming like teeth"). The limestone's porosity enabling sound travel constrains and shapes Marcus's method effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring joy to the grieving family) is clear from the opening. Escalation builds through the symphony's crescendo and the gradual awakening of laughter in the house above. Cost is visible—three years of accumulated grief requires monthly ritual maintenance. The conflict is primarily situational rather than oppositional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of mechanical prayer creating human connection. The concept that "joy, once given voice, never truly dies" resonates without being stated explicitly until earned. Bobby's echo discovery creates meaningful dramatic irony. The final image of pull cords composing their "quiet song" perfectly reweights the opening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("macerated more than flesh," "fossilized without proper aeration"). POV remains stable with Marcus as conductor-priest figure. The prose modulates effectively from mechanical precision to supernatural sustain. Some elevated diction ("supernatural sustain") occasionally strains but serves the ritualistic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("mournfully eager" bookend). Some density issues in exposition-heavy middle sections. The phrase "half-dance, half-prayer" and similar constructions feel slightly formulaic. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The leaf-blower symphony as grief therapy offers genuine freshness—transforming mundane tools into instruments of healing. The specific detail of twelve blowers creating musical notes elevates beyond generic "magical healing." The tunnel's echo chamber properties create a unique mechanism for emotional restoration that feels inevitable rather than convenient.</comment>
