I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds toward a resonant reconfiguration through pattern accumulation (spiral imagery, returning differently, twilight work) rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation coheres around capturing "density of presence" with clear internal contradiction between scientific pursuit and emotional memory. The final choice to reconceptualize presence as "something you return to differently" is earned through prior struggle. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ineffable weight of being") in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the nautilus-sun creation crystallizes a new understanding of presence with visible cost (three years of failure, revaluing everything). The accumulative lens holds as patterns (spiral, twilight, returning) cohere at the ending. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus and nautilus shell constrain choices throughout - the cooling surface drives urgency, the shell's geometry inspires the solution. "Crystalline veins pulsing" and "calcium curves throwing shadows" create vivid sensory texture. The laboratory setting at twilight specifically enables the discovery moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: failed experiment → Marcus's observation about patterns → Lyra's realization → successful creation. The cost is legible in "three years trying" and the grandmother's legacy weight. One meaningful deepening (the reconceptualization) that changes knowledge fits this length well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "returning differently" - how relationships and understanding deepen through iterative return rather than capture. The nautilus spiral becomes a resonant image for this principle. "Presence needs witness" crystallizes the theme without moralizing, and the final image of "small infinity, spiraling home" perfectly encapsulates the paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Lyra experiences the nexus ("dying heart at twilight") and scientific romanticism. Some register elevation in peak moments ("palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity") slightly strains the established voice. Dialogue between Marcus and Lyra carries effective subtext about their relationship.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of strong imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("ineffable weight," "density of presence") and mild overwriting in figurative language. "Scientifically romantic in the truest sense: precise in its tenderness" borders on explaining rather than embodying. Some repetitive structures in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific pursuit with emotional memory through the nautilus shell columella creates a fresh angle on the mentor-legacy story. The specific invention of "pocket-sun alchemy" and the reconceptualization of presence as iterative return shows genuine originality. The risk of blending scientific and lyrical registers mostly pays off.</comment>
