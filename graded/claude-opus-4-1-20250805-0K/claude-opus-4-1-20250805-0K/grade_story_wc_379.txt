<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are motivated and distinct, with Elena's trauma driving meaningful change through community support. However, the supporting cast functions more as helpers than complex individuals with their own conflicts. The final choice to write Sofia lacks the contradictory impulses or visible cost that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative lens with community actions building toward Elena's healing. While the closure shows Elena speaking again and deciding to write Sofia, the cost remains abstract—we don't see what this recovery demands or what path it forecloses. The orientation is clear but the ending's "This home" gesture toward the courtyard feels asserted rather than earned through visible stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The courtyard setting anchors the community but remains generic—"worn bench," "awakening streets" lack specificity. While the locked mailbox functions as micro-setting constraining Elena's past actions, the present-tense courtyard doesn't pressure current choices or supply resources that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Elena's healing through recovered letters) progresses smoothly but lacks meaningful resistance or complication. The resolution arrives through helpful neighbors making phone calls without obstacles—no competing priorities, failed attempts, or prices paid. The conflict resolves through collective goodwill rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of listening as healing emerges through action but tends toward the explicit, particularly in Marta's direct statements: "listening could unlock what seemed permanently sealed." The locked/unlocked metaphor works but the final meditation on abandoned objects feels more like authorial commentary than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains stability through Marta's perspective with appropriate access to her thoughts. However, the narrative voice lacks distinction—phrases like "sandstorm calm" and "gravity of quiet voices" feel writerly rather than emerging from Marta's thrift-curator consciousness. Dialogue serves plot but lacks subtext or character-specific rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract descriptors ("gravity of quiet voices," "invisible network") and telling over showing ("understanding ripple outward"). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats: "tears fell like rain after drought." The final paragraph's extended meditation on lessons learned stalls momentum without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locked mailbox holding love letters presents a serviceable premise but follows predictable beats: object discovered, owner identified, community helps, problem solved. The story doesn't transform its found-object frame—the resolution through neighbors' goodwill and convenient postal records feels safe rather than inevitable.</comment>
