<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's blindness creates genuine internal complexity through her heightened perception of water patterns, and her calm expertise under time pressure feels earned. The final line about "broken things learning to work again" resonates as both literal and metaphorical without being overstated. Minor deduction for Chen's relatively thin presence as mere observer-questioner.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: damaged drone threatens ship's navigation → Maya uses water-based perception to locate fracture → successful repair enables voyage. The closure lands with Maya's return to her workbench as Earned Stasis, accepting her transformed role. Cost is present but could be more visceral - the chemical explosion backstory provides context but the present-moment stakes feel slightly insulated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The depot's perpetual mist becomes functional setting that enables Maya's unique repair method through water droplet acoustics. Sensory detail effectively privileges sound and vibration over sight. The environment constrains and enables Maya's choices, though some descriptions lean toward the picturesque ("mist-coated," "corrugated metal eaves").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twenty-minute deadline creates temporal pressure and the Meridian's dependence on the drone establishes clear stakes. However, the repair proceeds too smoothly - Maya never struggles or makes a mistake despite the delicate work. The conflict lacks a meaningful complication or reversal that would force adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding new ways to perceive and work after loss emerges organically through Maya's water-based repair method. "Beauty isn't just visual" and the parallel between Maya's adaptation and the drone's repair avoid heavy-handedness. The ending image of broken things waiting to be understood resonates without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya's POV maintains consistent focus on tactile and auditory perception, with phrases like "whispered their locations through altered resonance" staying true to her blindness. Dialogue between Maya and Chen feels natural if somewhat functional. Minor dock for Chen's overly convenient setup questions ("How do you oversee such delicate work while blind?").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful technical detail about the repair process. Some figurative language enriches without overwhelming ("tiny vortexes in the mist that painted aerial patterns"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("magnetic calm" appears twice) and slightly repetitive sentence structures in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a blind repair expert using water acoustics offers a fresh angle on disability and expertise. The specific synthesis of mist, sound patterns, and navigation technology feels cohesive. However, the mentor-apprentice dynamic and race-against-time structure follow familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
