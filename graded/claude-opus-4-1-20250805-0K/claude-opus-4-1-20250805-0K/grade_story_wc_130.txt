<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morrow's motivation through grief and methodical searching lands strongly, with embodied details like kneeling and positioning the eyes. The transformation of Elias and other conjurers into "emotional mathematics" strains credibility without sufficient grounding in the established world rules, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the revelation that loss can be calculated as presence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where "absence, properly calculated, was just another form of presence" with emotional cost visible in Morrow's three-year search. The transformation mechanism feels under-explained, creating a slight causality gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with apple trees beneath stalactites creates a vivid, constraining environment that enables the transformation. Specific details like "limestone-filtered water rich with memories of ancient seas" and the mosaic's chipped patterns directly shape the ritual and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding Elias's disappearance, with pressure building through the ritual's steps and revelation. The cost appears in Morrow's acceptance that return is impossible, though the transformation's ease reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete mathematics metaphor—loss as an equation between presence and absence. The ending reweights earlier details like "Loss is never absolute when properly calculated," though some philosophical statements ("love transcends form") lean toward direct thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality with selective perception focused on patterns and calculations fitting Morrow's methodical nature. Elias's dialogue from "the mathematical certainty of the patterns themselves" feels slightly forced but doesn't break the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery like "stalactites dripping mineral water." Some abstract passages ("emotion operated on different mathematics") and repetitive constructions around "mathematics of emotion" create minor density issues without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of emotion as calculable mathematics offers a fresh angle on grief narratives. The underground orchard where conjurers transform into mathematical presence shows genuine invention, though the mechanism's vagueness prevents full originality.</comment>
