<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to merge timelines is clear and drives the closure, with embodied details like the hourglass "humming against his ribs." The character demonstrates consistent resilient positivity through concrete actions. However, the woman passenger remains underdeveloped beyond symbolic function, and Marcus's internal conflict lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus merges timelines. Closure lands with visible transformation as "the vanishing commuter ferry would vanish no more." Cost is legible through the shattering hourglass and Marcus's expansion/contraction. Orientation anchors (ferry, 11:47, Marcus as deckhand) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and interdimensional ferry create a vivid setting that constrains choices—Marcus must work within the ferry's materialization schedule and dimensional boundaries. Sensory details like "limestone cliffs phased between solid and ethereal" are selective and purposeful. The environment directly shapes the final convergence protocol, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of setting constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merging fractured timelines—is signaled early through the empty hourglass. Escalation occurs through accumulation of temporal fragments leading to the convergence protocol. However, the woman passenger subplot doesn't meaningfully complicate the main tension, and the resolution lacks a visible price beyond the hourglass shattering—we don't see what Marcus sacrifices or risks in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "permanent transience" and choosing to live all possibilities rather than shuttling between them. The final image of the compass pointing to "every now, always now, forever now" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The merging of the woman's three reflections embodies the thematic resolution concretely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and lyric touches like "when clocks run sideways and time folds into itself." The perceptual signature shows Marcus noticing dimensional details others might miss. However, dialogue is minimal and doesn't fully exploit subtext opportunities, and some phrases like "existential weight" drift toward abstract register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Marcus" appears 16 times) and some abstract passages that slow momentum. Phrases like "permanent transience" and "existential weight" lean abstract without embodiment. The "every now, always now, forever now" ending risks overwrought repetition though it attempts pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The interdimensional ferry concept offers a fresh angle on parallel worlds, avoiding typical sci-fi tropes through the specific detail of a commuter ferry. The empty hourglass storing moments rather than sand is genuinely inventive. The synthesis of time-travel and everyday transit creates an organic metaphor for life choices.</comment>
