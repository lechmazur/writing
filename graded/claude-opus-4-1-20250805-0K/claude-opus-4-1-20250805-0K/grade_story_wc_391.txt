Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through patient accumulation of details about lunar tracking, magnetic fields, and revolutionary planning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the viaduct's reprogramming crystallizes freedom's first stirrings.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira's seventeen-year patience crystallizes into revolutionary action with clear internal contradiction between wildness and restraint ("sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt"). The final choice to reprogram rather than destroy shows earned wisdom, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("Freedom always felt like falling at first").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - people wake to "thoughts they'd never known they could think" after Kira's patient accumulation transforms the control network. The seventeen-year preparation and midnight precision create clear before/after with felt consequence in that final image of "someone thinking their first free thought."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary constrains and enables the revolution - ice formation creates the precise window, hexagonal columns provide anchor points for copper rods, frozen lake reflects moon paths for navigation. Setting directly shapes tactics throughout, from the magnetic pull Kira feels to the dawn light revealing distant confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation - from solo waiting to coordinated twelve-sanctuary action, from tracking paths to placing rods, from individual patience to collective transformation. The seventy-three hour window creates genuine pressure, though the arrival of Tomás slightly deflates tension by confirming success rather than complicating it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete metaphor of water freezing "molecule by molecule" paralleling revolution's patient accumulation. The final image of someone thinking "their first free thought" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all that patient moon-tracking as preparation for this crystallized moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with geological metaphors fitting Kira's mapper perspective ("patience of geological time," "harder than basalt"). Some register elevation in conceptual passages ("synchronized thought," "ancient human urge") slightly exceeds the established naturalistic baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("basalt columns rose like organ pipes"), but several abstract conceptual passages slow momentum ("The revolution would not be loud. It would move like water freezing..."). Some repetitive constructions ("Kira understood," "Kira unfolded," "Kira felt") create mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological patience with revolution, avoiding typical violent uprising tropes for molecular transformation. The magnetic viaduct as thought-control network and its polarity shift after rain creates original world-logic, though the concept of patience-as-revolution itself echoes familiar slow-change narratives.</comment>
