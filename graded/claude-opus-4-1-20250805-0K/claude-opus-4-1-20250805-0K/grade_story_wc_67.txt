<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlene's contradictory impulses—preserving fugitives through art while documenting their crimes—create genuine tension that drives the closure. The old man's desire for his daughter's smile crystallizes believably against his dying breaths. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("she knew he was dying") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through ash portraits, the mask's history, and the gallery's dual nature, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marlene's role crystallizes with visible cost (tomorrow's inevitable repetition). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure lands with felt cost as the gallery's "ephemeral and essential" promise reweights all prior portraits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gallery's contested borderland status constrains every choice, while the porcelain mask and ash medium charge the final image. Sensory detail filters through Marlene's practiced precision ("each grain fell exactly where she intended"). The rocking chair's rhythm becomes a death clock that shapes the portrait's completion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: the chair's slowing rhythm, Marlene's selective truth-weaving, and the approaching authorities create mounting pressure that forces her ritual completion. The cost is legible—Thomas dies believing in transformation while Marlene knows it's illusion, perpetuating a cycle she cannot escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of false refuge emerges through concrete particulars—ash from burned criminal records, portraits that capture imagined selves, a gallery beyond jurisdiction but not consequence. The final image of "ephemeral and essential as breath" resonantly answers whether art can absolve without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Marlene's clinical precision ("scattered charcoal ash...with practiced precision") modulates effectively under pressure. The POV maintains consistent distance and never head-hops. Minor filter verb clusters ("She knew," "She heard") slightly dull immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some scaffold phrases ("She knew better," "Marlene understood this") could be cut. The final line resonates powerfully, recharging the vanishing/ephemeral motif. No loops or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ephemeral art, criminal documentation, and false sanctuary creates a non-obvious angle on fugitive stories. The twist that ash comes from burned criminal records transforms the portrait ritual meaningfully. Risk-taking in the morally complex ending (+0.3) where Marlene perpetuates illusion knowingly.</comment>
