<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aldric's transformation from isolated knight to guardian of possibility reads as earned through seven years of solitude learning the trees' languages. The final choice to take the marionette's hand carries visible cost ("splinters of potential pierce his skin"), though interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("the architecture of what might be").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aldric transforms into "something between flesh and possibility," with visible cost in blood becoming seeds. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward this crystallization, though the oath sequence could tighten its causal linkage to the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables—trees as "living equations," puppet stage at the heart, obsidian floor with starlight pools all participate in the transformation. "Each droplet of blood that fell became a seed" directly ties environment to closure with specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulated details: entering greenhouse → reading trees → finding stage → speaking oath → marionettes awakening → taking puppet's hand. The cost lands viscerally with "splinters of potential pierce his skin," though middle beats could sharpen their pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of inhabiting "the trembling moment before choice crystallized" emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of "unmanifest tomorrows, waiting to be born" resonates without moralizing, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("factually mystical energy").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice maintains elevated register appropriate to fantasy with phrases like "unsnapped the bonds between here and elsewhere." POV remains stable, though occasional drifts into omniscient knowledge ("three centuries ago") slightly exceed what Aldric would know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("trees bore fruit of crystallized potential") but occasionally overwrites with abstract compounds. Some redundancy appears ("trembling moment"/"shivering bliss"), though momentum generally sustains through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical greenhouse, puppet theater, and knight's transformation feels fresh—particularly trees as "living equations" and marionettes with "cores of molten possibility." The concept of becoming guardian of unmanifest possibility avoids genre clichés while maintaining coherence.</comment>
