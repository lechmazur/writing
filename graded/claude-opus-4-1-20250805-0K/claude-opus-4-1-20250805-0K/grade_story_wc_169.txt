I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal turns, with Marina's understanding deepening through repeated observations across timelines.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's motivation as a "detective of parallel selves" is clear and rooted in grief transformed into methodical exploration. Her internal progression from skepticism to understanding lands credibly. However, the emotional complexity remains somewhat abstracted through mathematical metaphors rather than embodied contradiction, and the final acceptance lacks visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered timeline observations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marina understands her grandmother's transformation. The cost is conceptual - accepting permanent separation - though more felt than visceral. The pattern of trial balloons → equations → dimensional travel coheres well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto functions as more than setting - its limestone spirals mirror equations and its tidal patterns enable dimensional confluence. The altitude gauge constrains Marina's perception across timelines. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("tide-polished," "phosphorescent ink"), and the space actively enables the story's central mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from seeking a lost grandmother to understanding dimensional travel to accepting a new form of existence. The forty-nine lantern configuration represents meaningful escalation. However, the resolution arrives through revelation rather than contested choice, and the cost remains primarily intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the equation H = (L × T²)/D and the pattern of trial balloons as "invitations." The final image of the grandmother "woven into the mathematics of hope itself" offers resonant closure without moralizing. The piece successfully explores grief and transcendence through concrete mathematical imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through emotional longing ("Marina traced the gauge's crystalline face"). The perceptual signature is distinct - seeing mathematics in nature, equations in spirals. Some passages drift toward explanatory register ("The disappearance hadn't been accidental"), but overall the voice sustains its unique texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with moments of genuine beauty ("where salt air met stone, the boundaries between parallel worlds grew thin"). However, several passages contain explanatory loops ("teaching others how to slip between worlds" restates the invitation concept) and some filter-heavy constructions dilute immediacy. Information density is moderate rather than high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum physics with emotional loss through "equations for hope" offers fresh specificity. The image of paper lanterns as dimensional messengers carrying mathematical formulas is genuinely inventive. The piece commits fully to its premise of mathematical transcendence without retreating into conventional grief narrative.</comment>
