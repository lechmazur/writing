<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's awkward confidence manifests physically through barefoot grounding and deliberate-yet-off-balance movements, creating genuine embodied character. Her progression from inherited observation (opera glasses) to revolutionary understanding shows earned change with visible cost—the three-month lull's exhaustion giving way to dangerous hope. Internal contradiction between caution and conviction plays out through concrete actions rather than labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kira's realization that revolution operates like opera—the pause before crescendo matters most. The ancient circle's harmonic resonance literally and metaphorically amplifies scattered resistance signals, with cost visible in the three-month exhaustion and risk of reigniting conflict. Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (hum, vibration, starlight) build toward the engine coughing to life.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport layers decay over ancient permanence, with the stone circle's pre-colonial markers creating temporal depth. Sensory hierarchy privileges vibration and frequency over visuals, matching Kira's discovery process. The environment actively constrains choice—the margin of daylight enables the stones' resonance, while the repair bay's "cathedral of rust" frames revolutionary possibility within exhaustion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal sanctuary-seeking to revolutionary reignition through Kira's discovery of the stones' amplification potential. The dominant stake—whether to risk restarting the failed uprising—tightens as understanding deepens, with visible cost in the "scattered resistance" and "broken promises." Pressure coheres through accumulative resonance rather than confrontation, matching the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The opera metaphor elegantly unites theme and action—revolution as generational song requiring both crescendo and pause. The ending's "forgotten engine coughed to life" offers non-literal answer to whether revolution failed, suggesting dormancy rather than death. Subtext operates through the stones' "harmonic resonance patterns" literally amplifying resistance while metaphorically connecting ancient and current rebellions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"cathedral of rust," "amber threads," "thunderous serenity"—without overwriting. Perceptual signature privileges tactile sensation (barefoot grounding, bone vibration) over visual, matching Kira's embodied discovery. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to intimate understanding, though occasional abstractions ("grace," "understanding") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence length and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror Kira's descent and discovery. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and internal realization. Some abstract phrasing ("thunderous serenity," "margin of daylight") borders on purple but serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition of "understanding" and filter constructions ("she felt," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of space opera rebellion with ancient stone circles and opera glasses creates unexpected resonance—technology and antiquity unified through frequency/harmony. The specific insight that revolution operates like opera (pause before crescendo) transforms familiar uprising narrative. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
