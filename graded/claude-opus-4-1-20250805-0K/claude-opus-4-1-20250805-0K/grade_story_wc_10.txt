I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through sensory patterns and thermal imagery rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes through embodied loss—her deafness paradoxically enabling new perception. The contradiction between grief and discovery plays out through concrete actions (pressing tuning forks, reading heat signatures). Her final acceptance that she "hadn't lost music at all" feels earned through accumulated sensory work, though some interior passages edge toward therapy-speak ("longing," "joy").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira's loss transforms into gain—she becomes the "first true listener" to thermal music. The cost is palpable: her hearing, her crewmates' lives, Kepler's death all weight the discovery. The accumulative lens holds as thermal patterns build toward the final image of "organisms that had learned to sing in temperatures."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as both setting and instrument—its surfaces refract light, conduct vibrations, hold breath. Thermal imaging transforms from monitoring tool to musical notation system. The Arctic environment's impossibility ("crystallized breath," "polar night") makes the plants' survival and communication miraculous, directly constraining and enabling Mira's discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal—each thermal discovery adds to Mira's understanding while the weight of loss (crew, hearing, mentor) provides constant pressure. The dominant stake of "rectifying what silence had stolen" evolves from personal loss to scientific breakthrough, with visible cost in frozen tears and isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of silent music and warmth in Arctic cold. The Indigenous consultants' wisdom about plant spirits gains credibility through Mira's discoveries, avoiding cultural appropriation through earned revelation. The final image of "quiet fire of life persisting" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting loss as transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision with scientific grounding ("62 Hz," "432 Hz fork," "two degrees Celsius"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Mira experiences the world through vibration and temperature rather than sound. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("prismatic symphonies," "crystallized breath") but mostly serve the piece's textural accumulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("frost patterns that seemed to pulse with unheard rhythms"). However, several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("music that could be seen and felt"/"music existed beyond sound") and abstract emotional labels ("longing," "joy") that could be more embodied. The filter-verb density in reflection passages slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of plants creating thermal music is genuinely fresh, transforming the "deaf person finds new way to hear" trope through specific scientific detail. The synthesis of Indigenous knowledge, acoustic botany, and thermal imaging creates something non-obvious. The risk of making temperature visible as music pays off through consistent execution.</comment>
