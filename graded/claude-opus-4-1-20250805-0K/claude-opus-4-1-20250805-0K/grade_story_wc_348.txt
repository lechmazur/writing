<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal contradiction between controlling/formulaic thinking and her need to understand Elena's artistic path creates genuine tension, with the chrysalis memory and foam observation driving a credible shift. The final choice to study Elena's scores shows earned change through specific experience rather than epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as foam patterns, chrysalis memory, and braided streams build toward Marina's recognition that "separation could become connection if you changed your frame of reference." The texts exchange provides closure with visible emotional cost ("sat down hard") and opportunity cost (six months lost), though the reconciliation arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ravine's braided streams and foam patterns constrain Marina's thinking, forcing the polymer chemistry metaphor that enables her breakthrough. Setting actively shapes the realization rather than merely hosting it, though some descriptive passages ("blue morpho butterfly") feel slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds through Marina's failed text drafts and the foam observation that triggers her shift from rigid to flexible thinking. The stakes (reconciliation with Elena) remain consistent, with cost visible in "six months of drafted texts, deleted" and Marina sitting "down hard," though the resolution lacks substantial resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The polymer/music synthesis emerges organically through Marina's observation that flexibility creates strength "not from rigidity but from flexibility." Elena composing about polymer chains while Marina learns symphonic thinking creates resonant convergence without stating a moral, earning the thematic integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina's scientific perspective colors perception consistently ("helical patterns," "polymer bonds," "optimal configuration") with clean free indirect style. The brief dialogue exchange feels natural with appropriate subtext, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("symphonically minded nature").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structure and purposeful scientific metaphors that advance meaning. Some redundancy appears ("separation became syncopation became symphony" following similar earlier constructions) and occasional overwriting ("luminous," "iridescent") but momentum generally holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The polymer chemist studying music/daughter studying chemistry reversal offers genuine freshness, with the scientific lens on emotional reconciliation avoiding generic parent-child templates. The specific synthesis of chemistry and music metaphors throughout creates memorable perspective.</comment>
