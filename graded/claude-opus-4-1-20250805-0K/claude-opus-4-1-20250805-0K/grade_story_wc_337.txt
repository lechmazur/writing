I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through pattern accumulation (mask fragments, knot unraveling) toward a resonant reconfiguration where spirits find peace through restoration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and grounded in her role as restorer, with concrete embodied details like "scarred fingers" and her ability to hear whispers others cannot. The internal progression from methodical work to spiritual communion earns the final acceptance of her inheritance. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("lucid unrest") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from single knot to seventeen restored masks, with the net's transformation from binding to mending creating resonant reconfiguration. The spirits' transition from "restless" to "radiant with recognition" delivers closure with felt cost (centuries of being unmoored). The pattern teaches itself early and pays off through the hemp becoming thread for restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Prism Sanctuary functions as more than setting—its crystal walls and rainbow shadows create the "interlaced hush" that enables spirit communication. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "hemp fibers black with age and salt," "subsonic vibration," "jellyfish made of starlight." The sanctuary's crystalline embrace in the final line charges the closure with meaning of containment and transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation: each unraveled knot releases another fragment, pressure intensifies through the prisms' hum and starlight focus. The cost is legible in "three centuries of tides" and spirits being "unmoored." However, lacks a moment of genuine struggle or choice under pressure—Mira's work proceeds smoothly without complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of binding into mending, fragments into wholeness. The masks as "anchors" that ground spirits creates layered meaning about identity and remembrance. The final image of the sanctuary holding "the living and the dead, the broken and the restored" offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception: "The fisherman's net lay coiled like a sleeping serpent." POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for this mystical work. Slight deduction for occasional drift into elevated register ("accumulating silence," "lucid unrest") that doesn't fully match Mira's craftsperson perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Some figurative density in places ("jellyfish made of starlight") serves the mystical tone. Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest") that could be more concrete, and slight repetition of "fragments" without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of mask restoration as spiritual anchor offers fresh angle on ghost stories. Specific details like using the drowning net as thread to mend masks shows creative synthesis. However, the core premise of craftsperson releasing spirits through restoration work follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
