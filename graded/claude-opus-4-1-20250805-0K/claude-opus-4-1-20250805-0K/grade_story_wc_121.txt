<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's internal conflict between fracturing and uniting drives meaningful change with visible cost (losing infinite possibilities to become whole), though the abstract nature of the "labyrinth of self" occasionally relies on conceptual telling rather than embodied struggle. The elder Kira's wisdom and the merging sequence effectively dramatize contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kira integrates her fractured selves, with clear cost (murdering infinite possibilities) and the viaduct's dissolution marking the transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks, though some middle passages lean heavily on exposition about the tablet's properties rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The viaduct's bioluminescent moss and procedural generation create a vivid, constraining environment that directly shapes Kira's journey, with the darkening glow mirroring her internal progression. The setting functions as more than backdrop—it actively responds to her consciousness and dissolves once integration is achieved.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical burden (tablet's impossible mass) through fractured identity to the ultimate choice of which timelines to let die, with the elder Kira crystallizing the cost: "refusing to choose murders you across all of them." The procedural generation's acceleration and the shadows of might-have-beens create coherent pressure, though mid-section exposition about the tablet's properties slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of integration versus fragmentation emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of gravity defiance as refusal to commit, with the final touchdown embodying acceptance. The collapse/unite rune and the distinction between "floating above life and truly living it" resonate without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the identity crisis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and strong perceptual signature ("between the drop and the ripple"), though occasional register drift into abstract philosophical language ("labyrinth of self," "quantum foam") slightly undermines POV consistency. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the merging sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some abstract conceptual language ("periodically eternal," "procedural generation based on her deepest fears") creates occasional opacity. Minor repetition of "fractured timelines" concept without varied embodiment, though the final paragraph achieves strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multiverse/identity crisis through the specific lens of gravity defiance as metaphor for non-commitment, with the viaduct as living maze responding to consciousness. The "periodically eternal" tablet and procedural generation concepts show risk-taking, though some elements feel more conceptually clever than emotionally grounded.</comment>
