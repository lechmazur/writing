I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered revelations and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between duty to preserve and knowledge of Thomas's crime creates genuine moral tension that drives her microscopic codicil solution. The final exchange with Eleanor embodies contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—mercy despite knowledge, preservation despite truth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully through Mara's codicil—preserving both Eleanor's need and historical truth with visible moral cost ("haunted euphoria"). The accumulative structure coheres as each revelation reweights the covenant's meaning, from simple restoration to moral reckoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty anchors the story spatially and temporally while the wisteria's purple waterfalls mirror across time (the locket photo to present). The walnut-ink stains and microscopic script constrain Mara's choices practically and symbolically, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archival task to moral crisis as Mara discovers Thomas's arson, forcing her choice between pure preservation and truth-telling. Her codicil solution carries visible cost—the "haunted euphoria" of keeping perfect records in an imperfect world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus truth emerges organically through Mara's discovery and solution, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of both women standing in wisteria sweetness "understanding that some covenants regenerate not through forgetting, but through the gentle thoroughness of remembering everything" offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("sheets of gold," "papery hands trembling"). The perceptual signature of an archivist noting ink quality and document details remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose occasionally overreaches with stacked modifiers ("haunted and luminous as the twilight itself") and some template phrasing appears ("Mara had sat with this knowledge"). However, key moments achieve strong clarity and the microscopic codicil image lands with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of an archivist adding secret testimony in microscopic script to preserve erased histories offers fresh angle on document preservation. The moral complexity of honoring a criminal's widow while recording his victims transforms the expected restoration narrative.</comment>
