I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's characterization through sustained silence and purposeful gesture creates a compelling presence, with her "spiralingly calm movements" embodying her philosophy. Thomas's grief over unfinished confession to his grandmother provides clear motivation. The transformation from burden to understanding feels earned through the mirror/shutter demonstration, though the epiphany arrives somewhat smoothly for the emotional weight involved.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through the mirror-and-shutter demonstration that teaches Thomas about darkness and light. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Thomas understands his grandmother already knew his love through actions, with visible cost in his tears and the dissolved secret. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2 ("canal guardian for seven years").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, wet planks with puddles reflecting stars, and the canal house with shutters create a specific, functional setting that enables the central demonstration. The dental mirror catching starlight and creating "miniature constellations" integrates setting with theme effectively. The canal's "gentle lapping" and "dark water carry[ing] reflected stars toward the sea" grounds the atmosphere in sensory detail that supports the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Thomas's need to resolve his unfinished confession—establishes early and deepens through Mira's wordless lesson about how "love spoken in actions echoes longer than words frozen by death." The escalation works through accumulation as each shutter configuration builds understanding, though the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won. Cost registers in Thomas's tears and the weight finally lifting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The darkness/light metaphor develops organically through the shutter demonstration, avoiding explicit moralizing while teaching that "darkness existed not to swallow light but to give stars meaning." The theme emerges through concrete action—opening shutters one by one—rather than assertion. The final image of Mira watching "reflected stars toward the sea, each one a secret finally spoken" resonates without stating the moral directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with occasional free indirect moments like "Mira recognized the weight of unfinished confessions." The prose achieves a meditative rhythm matching the "spiralingly calm" tone, though some phrases edge toward purple ("ribbons of sunset"). The complete absence of dialogue serves the theme of wordless teaching, creating a distinctive narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though several instances of overwriting appear: "spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse" strains the metaphor. Some redundancy exists between "guardian of the truth that the most profound empathy often speaks without making a sound" and earlier iterations of this theme. The closing sentence runs long without sufficient payoff for its complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a mute guardian teaching through physical demonstration offers a fresh angle on grief counseling. The specific use of shutters and a dental mirror to create light patterns feels inventive rather than derivative. However, the resolution—that unspoken love matters most—represents familiar territory in grief literature, executed well but not transformed into something entirely new.</comment>
