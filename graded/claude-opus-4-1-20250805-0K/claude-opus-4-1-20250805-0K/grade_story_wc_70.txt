<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between duty and preservation drives authentic choices, particularly her involuntary confessions creating immediate consequences. The transformation from secret-keeper to truth-teller is earned through the neural dampener failure, with visible cost in her isolation and eventual vulnerability. Minor deduction for the crowd's somewhat convenient wonder at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with the blackout triggering both the truth curse and drone failure, leading inevitably to Mira's revelation. Closure lands as Decisive Change when she broadcasts the truth, transforming from hidden guardian to public hope-bearer with clear cost (theft confession, vulnerability). The grandmother's riddle provides satisfying retrospective coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choices effectively—its height isolates Mira for her secret work while its broadcast system enables her confession. Sensory details like "nectar-sweet evening air" and "liquid gold" wings are selective and purposeful. The glass chamber at the peak functions as both physical and symbolic setting that shapes the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal secret to city-wide survival as the drone failure's implications unfold. Mira's agency drives the climax through her broadcast decision, with clear cost in admitting her theft. The quiet procession with candles rather than an angry mob provides earned complexity without deflating tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bees-as-renewal metaphor without explicit moralizing. The grandmother's riddle gains deeper meaning through action, and "some truths were meant to sting before they could heal" resonates without preaching. The lacquer box's painted bees seeming to move in candlelight provides strong non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's voice is consistent with selective perception focused on the tower and bees. The involuntary truth-telling creates natural voice modulation under pressure. Minor dialogue ("Tower's closed...") effectively reveals character state. Some filter verbs ("she'd been cursed") could be more immediate but don't harm closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in places ("like broken promises," "liquid gold") but serves the lyric tone. Minor template moments ("She described...," "They gathered...") don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The involuntary honesty curse provides fresh angle on the secret-keeper trope. Mechanical bees failing and requiring real bee salvation offers non-obvious environmental commentary. The transformation of a lightning tower into a hope lighthouse shows genuine synthesis. Somewhat familiar eco-disaster framework prevents higher scoring.</comment>
