I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal contradiction between healer and deceiver drives authentic choices throughout, particularly in the surgery sequence where competing impulses act simultaneously. The final acceptance of "knowing exactly who she was when everything false had been stripped away" represents earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("facades falling away") in mid-crisis reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's acceptance of her stripped-down identity, with clear cost (sanctuary closure, legal consequences). The causal chain from discovery to confession holds firmly. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words. The "quieter gift" lands as Earned Stasis with foreclosed paths visible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop setting actively constrains choices—glass roof panels become "windows into judgment," mist-dampened walls "absorb confession." The terrarium and surgical tools enable key actions. However, the redwoods and stars remain somewhat atmospheric rather than fully integrated into Marina's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (Marina's guilt) through professional (sanctuary closure) to ethical (300 animals needing homes), with each level forcing harder choices. The surgery sequence represents agency through renunciation—removing the modifications despite knowing it ensures the sanctuary's doom. Cost is unmistakable in the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between the chameleon's artificial colors and Marina's false facades. The final image of chameleon as "just a lizard now, just alive" resonantly reweights the entire deception without stating a moral. "Somehow, that was enough" offers a non-literal answer to questions of authenticity versus survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("chromatic dance," "prismatic displays") that reflects Marina's scientific background. Some filter-verb clusters in emotional peaks ("she'd felt," "she'd seen") slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature of noticing medical precision even in crisis ("micro-sutures," "subcutaneous light emitters") remains distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "told myself I was saving you/But I was using your pain" restates without advancement. Template cadence appears in the "She'd built/She'd removed/She'd felt" sequence. Information density could be higher in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of genetic modification for spectacle transforms familiar conservation corruption through specific detail (bio-chips, neural stimulators). The parallel surgery—removing false enhancements while reattaching the natural tail—offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the whistleblower-confession arc follows somewhat predictable beats without significant risk-taking.</comment>
