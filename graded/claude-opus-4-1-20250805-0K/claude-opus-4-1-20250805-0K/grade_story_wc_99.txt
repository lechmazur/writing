I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered symbols (lace, compass, bonsai) and memories toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kenji's decision to write tomorrow reweights the accumulated grief.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kenji's interior contradiction between teaching patience and his own paralyzed grief works well. The final decision to write "tomorrow" lands with earned cost through accumulated detail. Minor deduction for the student remaining functionally ornamental despite being on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands cleanly - Kenji's decision to write tomorrow reweights all prior symbols with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the lace pattern's hidden messages paralleling his own unspoken words. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The islet setting, weathered porch, and tactile details (silver droplets, kelp smell) create atmosphere that supports the isolation. The ghost ship's compass and grandmother's lace constrain Kenji's emotional options effectively. Setting enables the final choice through accumulated maritime imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through symbolic deepening - from teaching pruning to reading the lace to hearing the impossible bell. The cost crystallizes in "the color of every word he'd failed to say." One meaningful deepening that narrows emotional options, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between encoded lace messages and Kenji's inability to speak directly to Yuki. The final image of learning "how branches learn to bend without breaking" offers a non-literal answer to reconciliation. No explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Kenji's measured, elliptical teaching voice remains consistent and distinctive. The perceptual signature shows in how he reads meaning into objects (compass, lace). Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("The roots remember everything the tree forgets").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some metaphorical density in places ("the color of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat"). Information density high - most lines do multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "Tomorrow, he would..." repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of bonsai teaching, wartime encoding, and parent-child estrangement feels fresh. The ghost ship carrying undelivered messages adds originality. Risk-taking in the layered symbolic structure mostly succeeds without becoming overwrought.</comment>
