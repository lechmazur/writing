I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal Drive Lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Kira uses the shard to navigate realities, discovers her mother, and learns the truth about their gift's destructive nature.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with synesthetic perception ("rust became the taste of copper bells") and clear motivation driving Kira's search. The final choice to "map the repairs" feels earned through prior causality, though the mother's emotional state could be more viscerally rendered beyond "exhaustion."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change occurs when Kira transforms from seeker to healer, choosing to repair rather than merely map. The cost is legible - accepting responsibility for universal damage their gift causes. Causal linkages hold throughout (shard appears cyclically → leads to mother → reveals truth → transforms purpose).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity in the parallel universes ("walls breathed with bioluminescent fungi," "gravity pulled sideways") constrains navigation choices. The repair bay functions as setting that evolves causally with each redirect, though some transitions between worlds could anchor spatial choreography more precisely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through universe-hopping that narrows toward the nexus point, with the revelation about map makers' destructive impact raising stakes significantly. The cost of their gift creating "microscopic tears" that collectively destroy universes is unmistakable, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the discovery that exploration itself causes damage - a resonant metaphor that reweights all prior mapping. The ending offers a non-literal answer about transformation from curse to cure without moralizing, particularly strong in "some truths are withheld not from cruelty but from love."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic translations maintains consistency. Voice modulates appropriately with discovery ("Mom?" carries vulnerability), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("infinite universes waiting to be saved") that slightly exceeds the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, though some template cadence appears ("Another redirect" repeated structure). Information density is high in world-building passages, but phrases like "the vast work ahead" and "infinite universes waiting to be saved" lean toward abstraction rather than concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parallel universe navigation through sensory mapping creates memorable specificity. The concept of map makers inadvertently destroying what they explore offers genuine complexity, though the resolution mechanism of "mapping repairs" could be more concretely rendered.</comment>
