I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina's characterization succeeds through embodied habit ("packed her supplies mechanically") and the contradictory impulse between routine and the mysterious pull away from it. The final choice to continue both practices earns its emotional weight through the accumulated parallels with her grandmother. Slight deduction for the convenience of the cracked mirror timing and some emotional summary in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Marina's understanding transforms from painting "permanent things" at the quay to recognizing the practice of "loving something completely while letting it go." The cost is legible in "confused grief and unexpected joy." Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient discovery mechanism, though the accumulative structure coheres well.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond description - the phosphorescent cave light creates otherworldly atmosphere that separates this discovery from Marina's routine world. The quay's forty-three years of familiarity contrasts effectively with the hidden cove. The cave as repository constrains and shapes the revelation. Some generic coastal descriptors ("limestone cliffs," "weathered rope") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake - understanding artistic purpose and family legacy - deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The pressure builds from routine disruption through discovery to reconfiguration of meaning. The cost appears in Marina's realization that her grandmother "hadn't abandoned her family" but kept a different promise. Could score higher with more active agency in the discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shells-as-moments metaphor and the practice of "documenting the undocumentable." The final synthesis - "permanent in its impermanence" - resonates without stating a moral. The story earns its wisdom about art's relationship to transience through concrete discovery rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent distance with selective detail ("spider-webbing across Marina's reflection"). The perceptual signature shows an artist's attention to light and shadow throughout. Minor deduction for some register elevation in philosophical passages ("temporary eternities," "harsh light above") that slightly exceeds Marina's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good - most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("caves yawned like dark mouths"), some filter verb clustering ("Marina realized," "she understood"), and abstract phrasing in emotional passages that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hidden artistic legacy inverts the expected "abandoned family" narrative into one of parallel practices across generations. The specific detail of signed shells as diary entries feels fresh. The synthesis of public and private artistic practice offers genuine insight, though the convenience of the discovery mechanism prevents higher scoring.</comment>
