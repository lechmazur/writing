I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ira's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives consistent choices through magnetic field manipulation, though her internal conflict between duty (atmospheric repairs) and passion lacks embodied contradiction in scene. The final transformation from "obliging sky mechanic" to "navigator of time's hidden dimensions" lands with earned causality, but emotional complexity remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Ira's discovery reweights physics itself ("time had width as well as length"), with clear cost implied through Earth colleagues' future dismissal. Causal lens holds through because/therefore linkages (magnetic alignment → field manipulation → temporal perception), though the orientation arrives late (~150 words) without serving closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The xenobiology station setting constrains choices through its unique electromagnetic properties that enable temporal manipulation only during twilight alignment. Sensory details like "icy warmth" and "frost forming on surfaces even as they glowed with heat" create vivid paradoxes that mirror the temporal anomalies, though some technical descriptions lean toward exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal scientific validation to revolutionary physics discovery, with pressure building through Vasquez's interruptions and the station's physical shuddering. The tightening occurs when Ira must choose between safety (stopping) and proof (continuing), though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of "icy warmth" and creatures aging "backwards and forwards simultaneously," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of time as a navigable dimension with "width as well as length" offers a resonant answer to questions about perception and reality without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific register with purposeful technical precision ("magnetic nexus," "holographic principles") that reflects Ira's expertise. The perceptual signature shows through selective attention to electromagnetic phenomena others miss, though dialogue lacks distinct character differentiation between Ira and Vasquez.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and technical specificity without overwriting. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The lever locked into position with a soft click" simultaneously shows action completion, sound detail, and transition), though occasional filter constructions ("she could see") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-as-dimension with xenobiology research creates a fresh angle on temporal manipulation stories through specific details like "subdued awakenings" and paradoxical physics. The risk of grounding abstract temporal concepts in concrete electromagnetic manipulation and alien consciousness pays off, though some elements feel slightly derivative of classic sci-fi tropes.</comment>
