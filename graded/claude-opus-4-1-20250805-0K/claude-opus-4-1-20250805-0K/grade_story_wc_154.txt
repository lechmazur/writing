<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's trauma-driven motivation and the child's innocent need create authentic emotional complexity with contradictory impulses (survivor's guilt vs. desire to help) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to gift the coral fragment is earned through prior causality with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("lotus-hearted ache") but embodied perception and micro-choices under pressure elevate the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Maya's understanding of her survival's purpose crystallizes through the act of translation/connection, with emotional and opportunity cost visible on page ("better people hadn't" survived). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered languages, additions to the cast, and the final image of "two survivors writing new alphabets." Who/where/when anchored early (hospital atrium, post-bombing recovery).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse atrium with its misted glass and automated rain systems constrains the interaction to this liminal healing space, while the cast becomes a canvas that shapes the central action. Sensory detail filtered through morphine haze reflects Maya's state effectively. The coral fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image of endurance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in survival) deepens through accumulation as more patients join the translation ceremony, transforming individual trauma into collective healing. The child's request creates pressure that forces Maya to confront her survivor's guilt, with cost visible in "that lotus-hearted ache" and the giving away of her salvaged coral. One meaningful deepening sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of translation as transformation emerges organically through concrete action—decrypting cast messages becomes metaphor for processing trauma without explicit statement. The final image of "writing new alphabets of healing on the borders of their scars" offers resonant answer to the central question of how survivors create meaning. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "communication transcends language" reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through morphine-filtered awareness and translator's attention to language patterns. Dialogue between Maya and child feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some register drift into elevated diction ("convolutions," "collaborative art") that doesn't fully match the intimate, wounded POV established earlier, and brief head-hop to child's "shrewdly innocent gaze."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several artifacts damage immediacy: therapy-speak labels ("lotus-hearted ache"), elevated register drift ("collaborative ceremony of translation and transformation"), and some abstract telling ("understanding suddenly"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions mid-story. These artifacts don't touch the closure beat directly but accumulate enough to cap the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through the specific lens of a conflict translator finding new purpose in decoding children's cast graffiti. The transformation of medical necessity into collaborative art and the coral fragment as symbol of endurance through slow growth offer non-obvious angles. Specific details (Mindanao, Chamorro language) ground the universals effectively.</comment>
