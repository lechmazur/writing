I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and grounded in her professional expertise pivoting toward personal quest. Her internal contradiction between Guild training and intuitive discovery drives authentic choices. The final decision to "teach others to find beginnings in their endings" shows earned character evolution with visible cost (abandoning the Guild's commercial path).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure through Conceptual Repricing—Maya's discovery that "every ending was already writing its next beginning" reweights the entire premise. The cost is legible: six hours in trance, the fragment going dark (exhausted resource), and choosing teaching over monetization. Who/where/when anchored early with "abandoned radio towers of Silencia."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower city setting directly enables the story's mechanics—suspended architecture creates the swaying rhythm needed for gravitational gaps. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "each rung singing a different pitch," "mineral rain." The environment constrains choice through the need to climb for signal reception and the perigee timing window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the shard of hush) established early and deepens through Maya's discovery that silence contains "not emptiness but potential." The escalation follows accumulative logic as she traces the shard backward through cosmic history. Cost is visible: the fragment exhausts itself, and Maya must choose between Guild monetization and teaching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that "silence itself was a form of communication" and endings contain beginnings. The final image of the fragment as "a promise" resonates without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom through Maya's specific experience tracing signals backward through time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Maya filtering everything through signal interpretation: "electromagnetic poetry," "frequencies no machine could detect." Voice maintains consistency through technical-poetic fusion. Minor weakness in some elevated diction ("congregation of metal prophets") that occasionally drifts from Maya's practical interpreter perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied rhythm. Some overwriting in figurative language: "congregation of metal prophets," "frozen light and extinct dreams" cluster densely without pattern-teaching. The fragment "thrummed against her ribs" is physical and specific. Final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loop with "beginnings in their endings" restating the discovered principle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of signal interpretation with philosophical discovery—the concept of finding beginnings encoded in endings through "frequencies too quiet for their instruments" feels earned and specific. The abandoned tower city as signal-catching architecture shows originality. Risk-taking in the abstract concept pays off through concrete grounding in Maya's technical expertise.</comment>
