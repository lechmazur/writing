I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's jittery hands serve as both character trait and functional resonance mechanism, earning causality through the ending revelation. The internal conflict between nervousness and purpose drives authentic choices, particularly when her tremor becomes the key to bridging realities. Minor deduction for Corvin's somewhat convenient wisdom-dispensing role before vanishing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's role transforms from courier to "living bridge," with visible cost in Corvin's absence/transcendence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and the final reweighting of her tremor's meaning. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with character, setting, and situation clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway functions as more than backdrop—it's the testing ground where "the boundary between physical and ephemeral grew thin," directly enabling the Convergence. Sensory detail like "weathered vertebra humming with the planet's magnetic pulse" creates specificity. The pendant's vibration against electromagnetic fields shows environment constraining the pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from artifact delivery to witnessing/participating in the Convergence, with Corvin's fate revealed as willing transformation rather than loss. The cost lands clearly: gaining knowledge means accepting her mentor's absence and new responsibility. One meaningful deepening occurs when her nervousness transforms from liability to essential frequency-matching ability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of "routine into revelation," with the pendant serving as concrete vehicle for examining preservation versus resurrection of wonder. The ending reweights Elara's nervous tremor from weakness to gift—"Corvin's greatest discovery had been her all along"—without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the Luminari's ritual patterns and Corvin's chosen transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's courier-specific attention to artifacts' age and significance, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("gossamer robes," "collapsed centuries into heartbeats"). The free indirect style maintains consistency, and focalization stays controlled. Dialogue serves its limited purpose effectively when Corvin's teachings echo through memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears: "aurora's green ribbons," "spine of ancient stone," "weathered vertebra." Information density is high in key passages like the Convergence scene. Template phrasing emerges in "She watched them... She felt his presence... She carried the responsibility" sequence, creating mild cadence monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of artifacts as "seeds waiting for the right conditions to bloom" offers fresh angle on archaeological fiction. The tremor-as-resonance mechanism provides specific innovation, though the mentor-vanishes-leaving-cryptic-artifact setup follows familiar patterns. The Luminari civilization and Convergence ritual create adequate world-specificity.</comment>
