<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional identity as someone who creates spaces that "bent reality through orthogonal approaches." Her recognition of the corpse flower seed shows specific knowledge, and her understanding that "this wasn't just about planting" but preservation demonstrates layered thinking under pressure. The transformation from individual guardian to teacher of others lands with earned wisdom, though the emotional complexity could deepen further in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the growing flower, returning visitors, and expanding protection network. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira understands she must "innovate space itself" and teach others—a stance crystallization with clear cost (dedicating herself to this hidden work). The mysterious envelope sender and the unsolved escape room symbol create coherent pressure that forces this realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven "between office buildings, as if the city had forgotten to pave it over" creates immediate tension with the development plans. The corpse flower's transformation from death-scent to "rain on hot pavement, old books, bread baking" charges the space with possibility. The shimmering boundaries that make surveying equipment malfunction directly constrain developer choices, though some sensory details could be more POV-specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wild spaces from "comprehensive development"—is signaled early and tightens through the flower's growth and the space's self-protection. The escalation from solo planting to community gathering to Mira's final understanding that she must teach others shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the nightly dedication and the implied future commitment, though the opposition could apply more direct pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of escape rooms that "bent reality" paralleling the haven that protects itself "through misdirection." The transformation of the corpse flower from death-symbol to life-bringer resonates without stating its meaning. The final understanding that innovation requires "negative space, rooms to breathe" lands through earned experience rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent control with phrases like "whisper of paper against brass" and "storm-born silence that follows lightning but precedes thunder." POV remains stable with Mira's expertise filtering perception ("She recognized it now—Amorphophallus titanum"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("pocket of wilderness existed impossibly") that slightly exceeds the established voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, particularly in atmospheric passages. Information density is generally strong, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some conceptual repetition appears ("spaces that shouldn't exist" echoes similar ideas) and occasional elevated diction ("orthogonal approaches," "comprehensive development") creates mild register drift without full POV justification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of escape room logic with ecological preservation offers fresh synthesis—spaces that protect themselves through misdirection. The corpse flower's transformation from death-herald to possibility-scent subverts expectations meaningfully. The final revelation that Mira must "innovate space itself" grows organically from established patterns, though the mysterious sender's identity remains somewhat conventional.</comment>
