<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation as the last shore surveyor documenting drowned places is clear and deepens through specific embodied details like his careful handling of the inherited inkwell and ritualistic hiding of bottles. His stoic sensitivity manifests convincingly through controlled actions while internal pressure builds, particularly when he encounters his grandmother's performance space. The final choice to seal the bottle in the cornerstone carries visible emotional cost though his professional composure never cracks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with Edmund's ritualistic documentation building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where he transforms from surveyor to "archeologist of abandoned dreams." The closure lands with felt cost as he leaves "carrying the weight of witnessed absence" after sealing his grandmother's story in stone. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the pattern of preservation-through-documentation accumulates meaningfully through concrete actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as more than setting—it constrains Edmund's movements through knee-deep water and shapes his documentation method. Vivid sensory details like "barnacles crusted the lower walls and seaweed draped the doorways like funeral bunting" create atmosphere while the chandelier "hanging just inches above the waterline" provides a precise marker of decay. The environment directly enables the final act of hiding the bottle in storm-damaged mortar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving stories before demolition erases them—intensifies as Edmund moves deeper into the flooded structure and time pressure mounts with the turning tide. The conflict between official duty and personal mission creates authentic tension, particularly when "something loosened in his chest" in his grandmother's parlor. Cost is visible in his need to "wrest himself away" and the weight he carries at departure, though escalation could sharpen further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "interlaced absence" emerges organically through concrete details—empty seats making imagined crowds more prominent, silence amplifying ghost music. Edmund's method of placing notes in walls scheduled for demolition creates a resonant metaphor for memory preservation without stating it explicitly. The final image of him "carrying the weight of witnessed absence" reweights all prior documentation as acts of love rather than duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains Edmund's professional precision while allowing poetic observations like "pale fingers" for columns and "patient violence of water and time." His perceptual signature shows in how he notices "grooves where dancers had brushed" and documents "not just the angle of subsidence" but emotional residue. The controlled, formal register fits his surveyor role while subtle shifts like "whispered words" reveal emotional undercurrents.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The Victorian structure ahead wasn't just another casualty of erosion" establishes official purpose while revealing personal stakes. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, particularly in the varied paragraph lengths that accelerate toward closure. Some figurative language borders on precious ("hushed blaze of late afternoon light") but generally serves atmosphere without overwhelming clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a surveyor who secretly archives emotional histories in condemned buildings offers a fresh angle on climate fiction and memory preservation. The specific detail of three generations of surveyors using the same inkwell and Edmund's evolution into an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" transforms potential sentimentality into earned poignancy. The grandmother's piano recital backstory could feel convenient but is grounded through specific spatial details.</comment>
