<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyralei's internal contradiction between trained seduction and enforced celibacy drives authentic tension, with her rebellion earned through absorbed echoes of past courtesans. The transformation from "living poem written in gestures meant to entrance but never touch" to "living anthology of resistance" shows genuine character evolution with visible cost—her absence from the Academy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Lyralei's liberation transforms the Academy's control structure. The cost is legible: "one courtesan's absence proving that the most dangerous seduction was teaching someone to seduce themselves into liberation." The piece teaches its echo-harvesting pattern early and pays it off through escalating releases that culminate in systemic change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary function as more than backdrop—the threads become tactile barriers Lyralei must physically untangle, while the snow melting in "perfect circles where the echoes had passed" provides visual proof of transformation. Setting constrains choice through the magical threads that must be decoded using courtesan training.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each released echo grants Lyralei greater fluidity and certainty, from initial thread-work to "dancing through the courtyard's silence." The dominant stake—freedom versus conformity—tightens as she progresses from external untangling to internal transformation, with clear cost in her irrevocable break from the Academy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "devotion without submission" and the space "between sigh and smile" containing infinite transformation. The final image of melted snow revealing "silver stones that reflected not her trained poses but her authentic self" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, reweighting all prior gestures as potential rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm that modulates from contemplative opening to urgent middle action to triumphant conclusion. Some elevated diction ("infinitesimal pause contained lifetimes") occasionally drifts from character register, but perceptual signature remains consistent in how Lyralei reads bodies and threads as texts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("each flake catching starlight like scattered diamonds"), but occasional overwriting appears: "cada movement a verse in the poem she would write with her freedom" contains a typo and strains the metaphor. Some paraphrase loops exist between "devotion could exist without submission" and similar restatements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan narrative with magical rebellion, transforming the expected seduction story into one about self-liberation. The concept of harvesting echoes of past resistance offers genuine originality, though the Academy-as-oppressor framework follows familiar patterns without full transformation.</comment>
