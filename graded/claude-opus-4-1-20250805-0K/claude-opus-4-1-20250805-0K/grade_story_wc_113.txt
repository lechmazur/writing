I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where past and present merge.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (returning nightly to the flooded pit, transcribing dissolving notation). The contradiction between isolation and collaboration with the dead works well. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient final transformation lacking intermediate struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marcus completes Elisabetta's interrupted performance, with visible cost (standing chest-deep, risking drowning). The dual-signed program crystallizes the merger of past/present. Slight deduction for the miraculous dry state at the end which softens the physical cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded pit functions as both setting and instrument, constraining Marcus's choices (chest-deep positioning required for the final note). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - "black water reflecting the dozen oil lanterns" sets atmosphere efficiently. The transformed acoustics directly enable closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening revelation (program dissolving → notation appearing → ghost orchestra manifesting). The water level forcing Marcus deeper creates physical pressure. However, no real opposition or cost until the final movement - the journey feels somewhat frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "in-between space" metaphor - neither stage nor audience, neither past nor present. The final dual signature elegantly resolves the question of artistic continuity across death. Avoids moralizing while offering resonant closure about unfinished work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("like a patient dog," "peculiar purgatory"). Some register elevation in places ("architects never imagined") but generally consistent. The absence of dialogue works for the "wordless conversation" concept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("trembling reflection," "liminal space"). Minor template issues: "Marcus had heard...How she'd...How musicians still..." Information density is solid but could be tighter in the middle exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and artistic legacy through the water-as-developer metaphor. The dissolving/revealing inversion and the flooded pit becoming an instrument show genuine ingenuity. Slightly derivative ghost musician premise elevated by specific execution.</comment>
