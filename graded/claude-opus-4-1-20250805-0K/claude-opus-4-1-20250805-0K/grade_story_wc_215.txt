I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal turns, with the stained glass box serving as a focal point for meaning accumulation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization achieves strong embodied presence through "careful steps of someone who had learned that survival meant noticing everything while disturbing nothing." Her choice to preserve silence rather than speak gains weight through the grandfather's modeling, though the epiphany about the covenant's failure feels slightly over-articulated in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well with the glass box discovery catalyzing understanding of the collective's dissolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) - Mara accepts her role as keeper of silence with visible cost ("the last keeper of tangled promises"). However, the covenant's incompatibility explanation tends toward summary rather than embodied revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned apiaries "like broken teeth" and the stained glass box's "amber and crimson panels catching dawn light that shouldn't exist" create vivid sensory grounding. The oasis setting constrains Mara's choices effectively, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental ("luminous as honey in abandoned combs").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through the ghosts' urgent gestures and Mara's growing understanding of inherited duty. The tension between speaking and preserving silence creates genuine pressure, though the conflict resolution through understanding rather than action slightly diffuses dramatic force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of eloquent silence - communication's failure creating its own truth. The final image of Mara carrying "the luminous weight of their collective failure and love" resonates without moralizing, though some thematic statements edge toward the explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature ("translucent forms moving between the empty hives with purpose"). Some passages drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV ("mute eloquence," "museum of unfinished conversations"), creating occasional register inconsistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The box hummed—not with bees, for they were long extinct—but with something older"). However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("like captured sunset") and repetitive phrasing around "silence/unspoken" create minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of inherited silence as active preservation offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic tropes. The specific synthesis of beekeeping covenant with communication failure feels organic, though the resolution's embrace of continued silence plays somewhat safe.</comment>
