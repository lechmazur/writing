<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Margaret's motivation to recover stolen memories drives clear choices with embodied emotion (boots squelching, headlamp searching). The final choice to accept both beautiful and dark memories shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost—she becomes "heavy with recovered histories." Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("familiar thrill of discovery") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation—broken constellations, preserved memories, shipwreck names—building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Margaret becomes the "living repository." Cost is visible: carrying the weight of communal trauma. Slight deduction for the explain-everything ending that resolves Gran's motivations too tidily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices excellently—Margaret must navigate "between rusted garden frames and salt-crystallized benches" while barnacles and tides mark temporal pressure. Setting charges the final image through shipwrecks as "sentinels" bearing witness. Minor deduction for some catalog-like description ("mason jars of preserved fruit") that doesn't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (recovering Gran's memories) to communal (preserving village history) with visible cost in Margaret becoming burdened with "fragments from everyone who'd traded here." The tightening occurs when she discovers Gran's darker motivations. However, resolution lacks agency—the ring simply "gives back" without Margaret facing a meaningful trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: fairy rings as memory traders, broken constellations as harvest maps. The ending offers a non-literal answer about preservation versus forgetting through Margaret becoming the repository. Slight deduction for the explicit moralizing in the final line ("some prices are too high to pay").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent folklorist perspective with selective perception ("detecting patterns others missed"). Free indirect style works well. However, register occasionally drifts into academic exposition ("monuments to those who'd paid the price") and some filter verbs dull immediacy ("she could see them").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves good momentum with varied sentence structures and selective detail. Information density is high in discovery passages. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("Margaret understood now," "Margaret knelt"), some template cadence in the memory listing, and occasional overwriting ("phosphorescence matching the broken constellations").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy rings with memory trading and constellation maps as harvest records. The specific detail of shipwrecks named for lost concepts (Remembrance, Chronicle, Testimony) elevates the premise. Transformation of folklore collector becoming the collection shows originality, though the resolution trends toward safety.</comment>
