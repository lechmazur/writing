<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's transformation from abstract researcher to patient observer is tracked through concrete choices (daily visits, resignation), but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cost of her resignation is declared but not embodied—we don't see her struggle with the decision or feel what she's giving up beyond "career suicide."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's daily observations building toward her resignation and new research method. The closure (resignation and establishing observation stations) has visible cost through career abandonment, though the transformation from flood damage to research station feels somewhat convenient. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting directly constrains and enables Elena's choices—the butterfly dust patterns become her new research method, and the ruined space provides the conditions for her transformation. Sensory details like "mud-caked benches and the persistent smell of rot" and the accumulating dust patterns are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions of the dust's effects feel abstractly convenient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Elena's shift from theoretical to observational science) deepens through accumulation of butterfly dust observations, fitting the textural lens. However, the escalation lacks felt pressure—her colleagues' "theatrical mourning" provides no real opposition, and her resignation decision arrives without dramatized struggle or visible trade-offs beyond declared career consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of patient observation versus "theatrical" analysis emerges through concrete accumulation of dust patterns and Elena's changing research approach. The final image of Elena continuing her work while butterflies continue theirs offers a non-literal answer about profound change happening "quietly, inevitably, and entirely without theatrics," though the theme statement in the final line edges toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and Elena's perceptual signature shows in how she processes the greenhouse through her physics background ("gravitational lensing effects," "fractal patterns"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract register ("preprocessed reality without mathematics as an intermediary") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "decay is not drama. It is instruction" restates the prior paragraph's point; "profound change happens: quietly, inevitably, and entirely without theatrics" redundantly emphasizes what's been shown. Template cadence appears in "She noticed... She began... She established..." sequences. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise of a scientist finding new research methods through observing decay offers a fresh angle on post-disaster recovery narratives. The butterfly dust as data collection method provides specific texture, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical—the university's sudden conversion to research station and other scientists arriving to study Elena's work lacks the grounded resistance that would make the change feel earned.</comment>
