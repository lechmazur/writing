<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's grief-driven motivation crystallizes through embodied details like the warm pressed flowers and her selective amnesia about Elena's face. The contradictory impulses between forgetting and remembering act simultaneously in the cemetery scene, particularly when she chooses to keep only one memory vial. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient revelation mechanism through coffee grounds, though the final choice to "remember how to grieve" lands with genuine emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition (coffee grounds, salt formations, gravity pockets) building toward Marina's discovery and choice. The Resonant Reconfiguration closure—keeping one memory while accepting the burial of others—reweights the entire premise with visible cost: "Tomorrow's coffee grounds would show new patterns, and Marina would read them with eyes that remembered how to grieve." The world-building around extracted memories stored in gravity-warped spaces provides strong causal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravity-defying physics create a distinctive setting where "flames bent sideways" and "cremated ashes sometimes drifted upward like snow." The salt crystal formations and gravity pockets constrain Marina's investigation and charge the final image. Slight deduction for the whale's role feeling more thematic than physically integrated, though the cemetery's nauseating gravity fluctuations effectively mirror the story's emotional disorientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost memories of Elena—tightens through Marina's pattern recognition leading to the cemetery dig. The escalation from noticing coffee ground patterns to excavating memory vials creates meaningful pressure, with Marina's choice between full reclamation and selective integration providing genuine cost. The gravity pockets' increasing influence tracks with emotional intensity, though the whale's connection to the accumulated grief could be more causally explicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of grief's physical weight emerges through concrete images: memories stored in vials, gravity pockets holding deleted sorrows, the whale drawn by "accumulated weight of forgotten sorrows." The final image of Marina reading coffee grounds "with eyes that remembered how to grieve" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The story resists simple resolution, acknowledging that "some memories deserved their burial, but others could be exhumed gently."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception focused on physical anomalies and pattern recognition. Strong perceptual signature in details like "coffee grounds swirled in impossible patterns" and the tactile handling of memory vials. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("crystalline clarity," "surgically removed") that slightly exceeds Marina's established lexicon as a lantern lighter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the discovery sequence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The whale had beached itself three days ago, its massive body disrupting the gravity pockets that kept our floating city stable." Deductions for repetitive "Marina + verb" constructions in the middle section and some filter verb clustering ("Marina understood," "Marina felt") that dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of physically extracted and buried memories stored in gravity-warped spaces offers a fresh angle on grief and forgetting. The specific synthesis of salt crystal technology, gravity anomalies, and memory storage creates an original world logic. The choice to keep one memory while accepting the others' burial transforms the expected "recover everything" resolution into something more nuanced and emotionally true.</comment>
