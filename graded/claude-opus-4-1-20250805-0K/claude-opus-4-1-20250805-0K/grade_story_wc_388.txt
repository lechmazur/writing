<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between exposing truth and preserving sanctuary crystallizes through concrete discoveries, with his final choice earned through accumulated evidence. The decision to bury both truth (letters) and protection (diamond) shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to moral dilemma to earned resolution. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Marcus chooses preservation over exposure, with visible cost in abandoning his life's mission. Minor orientation lag in the first 120 words slightly weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radioactive wasteland and impossible orchard create immediate pressure, with the Geiger counter's clicks and dust storms providing sensory grounding. The diamond's physical flaw becomes central to the final choice, though some setting details (the tent, lamplight work) remain functional rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from scientific curiosity to moral crisis as each reconstructed letter tightens Marcus's dilemma between his debunking mission and preserving life-saving sanctuary. The cost manifests in his abandonment of exposing truth—his life's work—though the personal price could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the diamond's central metaphor: imperfection creating wholeness, mirroring how "uncomfortable truths" and "lies worth preserving" coexist. The final image of Marcus returning to the "poisoned world" while leaving paradise intact resonates without stating its moral, though "the greatest truth was knowing which lies protected something worth preserving" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-limited with selective perception reflecting Marcus's investigative nature ("sharply observant," "matching edges and ink patterns"). Some passages drift toward explanatory register ("He understood now that some truths were more complex") rather than staying embodied in his specific lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and specific imagery like "branches heavy with fruit that glowed faintly." However, several abstract summaries ("deliberate suppression of lifesaving knowledge," "human choice") and repetitive constructions ("Marcus felt," "Marcus faced," "Marcus looked") create minor drag without touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a flawed diamond creating a radiation-proof zone through its imperfection offers genuine freshness, particularly when tied to moral complexity about preserving useful lies. The transformation from debunker to keeper of secrets provides a non-obvious turn, though some thematic statements feel safely centered.</comment>
