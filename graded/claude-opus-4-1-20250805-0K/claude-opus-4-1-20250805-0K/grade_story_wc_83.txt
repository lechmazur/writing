I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor assessing its publishability in a prestigious literary venue.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—carrying the geode since Kandahar, planning the forty-minute window for months. The contradiction between her grief-driven hunt and scientific rationality creates authentic tension. The final choice to release rather than harness the potential is earned through prior characterization, though Chen's quick conversion strains credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Amira's discovery crystallizes the existence of "pools of unused potential" with clear cost (security breach, professional risk). The causal lens holds: because the missile struck mid-celebration, the unrealized futures pooled; because the observatory's elevation thins boundaries, detection becomes possible. The closure lands with "Tomorrow's stolen dreams would find new dreamers" carrying conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory three kilometers above Earth effectively constrains the forty-minute cooling window and enables the quantum detection. The geode's crystalline structure catching "sterile light" and later glowing "not with light but with possibility itself" charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, though some technical details feel generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: from personal grief-hunting to scientific discovery to world-changing revelation. The forty-minute time pressure forces decisive action, and security's arrival crystallizes the cost. The revelation that Earth is "scarred by a thousand conflicts" with "each scar hiding its own pool of trapped potential" effectively broadens scope while maintaining personal stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physics metaphor—"Energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed" resonates beyond literal application. The concept of "unused potential" from violent death accumulating rather than dissipating offers genuine philosophical weight. The final image of stolen dreams finding new dreamers avoids sentimentality while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision filtering grief: "perturbation patterns," "quantum scanner," mixed with embodied emotion—"the intangibly tangible presence." Dialogue between Amira and Chen feels natural and advances plot through subtext. Some register elevation in peak moments ("bleak exhilaration coursing through her") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful technical vocabulary. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor issues include the somewhat forced phrase "intangibly tangible" and occasional overwriting ("scarred by a thousand conflicts"), but line-level craft supports the story's ambitions effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of quantum detection revealing pools of unrealized potential from violent death offers genuine originality. The synthesis of grief narrative with hard science fiction creates unexpected resonance. The specific detail of the wedding geode as recording device and the observatory's elevation as enabling factor demonstrate imaginative problem-solving beyond template responses.</comment>
