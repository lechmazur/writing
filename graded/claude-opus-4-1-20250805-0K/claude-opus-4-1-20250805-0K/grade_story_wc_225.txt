I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kaspar achieves self-forgiveness through understanding the frozen game's parallel to his own error.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaspar's motivation is clear and embodied through specific gestures (fidgeting with copper pieces, tracing stone). His internal conflict between guilt and the need for redemption drives genuine choices. The final act of self-forgiveness feels earned through his recognition of parallel mistakes, though the epiphany arrives somewhat smoothly for peak emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaspar's self-forgiveness reweights his past mistake with visible cost (the copper piece offering). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as frozen time metaphors layer with chess imagery. The "woven hush" concept effectively bridges physical and emotional transformation, creating legitimate closure under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village with suspended raindrops and the platinum labyrinth constrains choices and charges the final image powerfully. Sensory details like "raindrops hung like glass beads" and the "peculiar vibration where time still flowed against time that didn't" create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that directly shapes Kaspar's actions and realizations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) develops through accumulative pressure as Kaspar decodes the tapestry and recognizes parallel errors. The escalation from observation to active thread-pulling to final understanding follows textural deepening. Cost is visible in accepting his imperfection's permanence, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the frozen game's parallel to Kaspar's teaching error - both focused on attack over defense. The "woven hush" becomes a space for redemption between frozen moments, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final copper piece offering resonates as non-literal answer to whether perfection is necessary for teaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("fierce repose," "winnow truth from possibility"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with discovery, though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("temporal prison") that slightly exceeds Kaspar's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with strong syntactic variety and information density. Minor issues with occasional elevated register ("monumental proportions," "profound quiet") and one instance of telling over showing ("His disgrace had been swift and thorough"). The metaphorical density serves the accumulative mode without overwhelming clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The time-frozen village as metaphor for being stuck in guilt offers fresh angle on redemption narrative. The chess-teaching error specifically tied to the Sicilian Dragon defense adds authentic detail. While the frozen-time concept isn't wholly original, its execution through the woven hush and platinum labyrinth creates memorable specificity.</comment>
