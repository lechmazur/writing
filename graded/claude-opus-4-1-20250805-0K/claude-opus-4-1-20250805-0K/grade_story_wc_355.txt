<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—pacifist who "fought battles through frequency"—act throughout the scene, with her final understanding of empathy through listening earned by the grandmother's parallel path. The meditation on silence varieties and the technical pursuit create genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional calibration in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the resonant reconfiguration when the diary opens, revealing the grandmother's parallel cataloging of silence. The closure lands with emotional cost—understanding that empathy requires patient tuning rather than force. Orientation anchors established early (workshop, New Year's Eve, twenty minutes).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop setting with its collection of radios, music boxes, and singing bowls constrains Mara's method—she must use frequency rather than force. Sensory details effectively filtered through Mara's technical perspective. The orchestral resonance of all equipment when the lock opens charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the tightening timeframe (twenty minutes to midnight) and Mara's growing understanding that the lock requires emotional rather than mechanical manipulation. The cost is legible when she realizes some locks open "not with force but with patience." One meaningful deepening that changes her understanding of both the lock and empathy itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Mara and her grandmother's different approaches to cataloging silence. The final insight about empathy being "paved with listening to what isn't said" reweights all prior technical efforts. The resonance between frequency adjustment and emotional wavelength avoids explicit moralizing while delivering thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Mara's technical lens—she perceives the world through frequencies, wavelengths, and mechanical precision. Voice maintains consistency even under the pressure of discovery. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("theatrical sincerity") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-pressure beats ("caught starlight like scattered coins"). Information density strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. Minor template cadence in the middle section's description of silence varieties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Victorian resonance locks with modern frequency scanning creates an original premise. The specific angle on silence cataloging and the grandmother's war correspondence focusing on "spaces between" battles transforms familiar inheritance-unlock narrative. Some safety in the resolution's emotional tidiness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
