<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's psychometric gift creates clear motivation through embodied perception ("swaying, caught in the rhythm") and concrete internal conflict between professional duty and preservation instinct. The final choice to steal the film strip shows earned agency with visible cost—her report will lie, but the love letters find witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as psychometric layers build toward Vera's decisive theft, with cost visible in her professional betrayal ("clinical, professional" report versus sacred preservation). The pattern of goodbye letters accumulates pressure until the final image reweights the entire demolition as both ending and beginning ("seeds waiting to bloom").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as active setting—"vessel," "three-dimensional diary" where emotional geography maps to physical space (northwest corner holds regret, ceiling stores hope). Spatial imagination constrains Vera's reading and charges the final image of carried secrets.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through psychometric accumulation from single letters to "decades of goodbye letters layering like double exposures" until overwhelming intensity forces Vera's choice. The cost manifests in her necessary professional lie, though the tightening could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete motif of "unused love" stored in physical objects, culminating in Vera's realization that witnessing requires action. The final image of seeds waiting to bloom resonantly answers whether abandoned love can find purpose without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through psychometric sensitivity ("dust motes and memory," "confession booth"). Voice maintains lyric control even under overwhelming input, with purposeful compression serving the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative density mostly avoids overwriting ("sleeping snake," "metal teeth"), though some passages edge toward purple ("hushed thunder of her own heartbeat"). Information density high with multi-purpose sentences, but occasional abstract phrasing ("emotional geography") and slight redundancy in the goodbye letter descriptions cost precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with abandoned cinema creates non-obvious angle on lost love. The concept of love developing "like photographs in chemical baths" and the projection booth as emotional vessel show genuine imaginative reach, though some metaphors feel slightly familiar.</comment>
