<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's gift as a translator of "spaces between languages" drives meaningful choices throughout, particularly her decision to unfasten the painted histories. The internal contradiction between preserving hidden histories and revealing them creates genuine tension. Her connection to her grandmother provides consistent motivation that earns the final commitment to make "lost voices" visible again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Mira accepts her role as keeper of lost histories with visible cost (the fragment's ephemeral nature means stories can only be "briefly" visible). The piece anchors who/where/when immediately and builds pressure through layered revelations about the painting's pentimento shadows. Causality holds as each discovered layer deepens Mira's understanding and commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemist's market suspended on rope bridges creates immediate atmospheric pressure, while the painting's pentimento layers function as micro-setting that directly constrains Mira's choices. Valdric's palette knife becomes the tool enabling discovery. The lighthouse fragment's specific property—projecting stories onto fog—charges the final image of "stories dancing in droplets."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to cultural preservation as Mira uncovers each painted layer, with the dominant stake (recovering erased histories) signaled early through the "seafaring peoples whose language had been erased." The cost is explicit: these stories can only be made "visible briefly" in fog, not permanently preserved. Mira's agency drives the uncovering through careful knife-work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of scraping paint to reveal hidden histories, avoiding abstract philosophizing. The concept of translation expands from linguistic to visual to temporal, with the final image of stories "dancing in droplets" offering a non-literal answer about preservation's ephemeral nature. The "spaces between" motif earns its resonance through specific application.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Mira reads "pentimento shadows" and "spaces between languages" that others miss. Voice modulates effectively from childhood memory to present focus, with controlled shifts in psychic distance. The prose maintains consistency through the palette knife sequence, though some passages lean toward elevated register ("eternal instant expanded").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some elevated diction creates mild register drift ("elusively tangible sense," "infinite moment"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and theme. The final paragraph contains slight redundancy in explaining the stories' projection. Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of colonial erasure, art preservation, and translation offers a fresh angle on historical recovery. The specific method—encoding stories in light refraction and paint layers—transforms the familiar "hidden history" trope. The painted constellation map "that appeared only in paintings, never in the actual sky" demonstrates genuine inventiveness in world-building.</comment>
