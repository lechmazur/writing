<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to prove Marcus's theory about atmospheric memory is clear and drives her choices, including refusing rescue. Her internal experience is concrete through specific observations (categorizing clouds by emotion), though some emotional transitions lack embodied contradiction. The final realization about spaces giving memories back represents earned insight from her accumulated observations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered observations building toward Elena's final understanding. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when she realizes empty spaces "give their memories back," reweighting Marcus's incomplete theory with visible cost (her untethered drift). The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sky gondola at 30,000 feet constrains Elena's choices (untethered drift necessary for her work) and the brass telescope functions as essential tool throughout. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("dusty starlight," cloud formations, gondola swaying). The atmospheric setting directly enables the story's central concept of weather as memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving atmospheric memory exists—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated observations. Elena's refusal of rescue helicopters demonstrates agency with clear cost (isolation, danger). The quietly explosive storm's transformation provides meaningful tightening as it releases centuries of memories, though additional pressure points would strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete imagery of clouds carrying emotion and memory without explicit moralizing. The final insight that empty spaces "give their memories back" offers a resonant answer to the central question through earned discovery. The indigenous knowledge reference adds complexity without becoming preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with selective perception filtered through Elena's meteorological expertise ("cirrus wisps carried longing"). The prose modulates effectively between technical observation and lyrical description. Some filter phrases ("she saw," "she thought") could be trimmed for greater immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor repetitions appear ("she'd documented," "she'd found") and some abstract phrases ("spooled wholeness") lack concrete grounding, though overall momentum remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of categorizing clouds by emotion and weather as Earth's memory offers fresh perspective on meteorology. The synthesis of scientific observation with emotional/spiritual understanding feels organic. The specific detail of Marcus vanishing into a cumulonimbus and the brass telescope's peculiar lens add originality.</comment>
