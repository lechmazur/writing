<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between empirical verification and embracing paradox drives authentic tension through the swallowed seed sequence. The choice to validate "Quantum Folklore" earns its weight through prior struggle with contradictory memories. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous doubt") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Conceptual Repricing closure—Mira's classification reweights reality itself, making multiplicity the saving principle. The cost is legible: accepting paradox means abandoning certainty, visible in "truth. Not the truth, but truth nonetheless." Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words with Mira on the ridge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghost orchids and knowledge fruit seed constrain choice meaningfully—the seed must be swallowed, the orchids mark the seven-year bloom. "Purple lightning traced the horizon's edge" and pre-monsoon winds create urgency. Setting actively pressures the decision timeline though some descriptions lean decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulation: contradictory memories intensify until Mira realizes multiplicity is the island's defense mechanism. The three-day monsoon deadline creates genuine pressure, and her classification choice carries weight—"would certainly be challenged." Cost is clear in abandoning singular truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of preservation through multiplication—"cultures survive not through rigid history but through abundant, contradictory tellings." The final image of orchids reflecting stories rather than light perfectly crystallizes this without moralizing. Strong resonance between form and meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism—"floated like dreams above the clouded sea" establishes tone immediately. POV remains stable, perception filtered through Mira's reality-checker lens. Some elevated diction ("empirically whimsical") occasionally strains but mostly serves the fantastical setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "luminous doubt" and similar phrases appear multiple times creating mild repetition. Strong information density in memory sequences. The final paragraph contains some abstract phrasing that slightly dulls impact but doesn't obscure meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of "Quantum Folklore" as cultural survival mechanism is genuinely fresh—multiplicity as preservation rather than confusion. The reality checker validating paradox inverts expectations meaningfully. Risk-taking in embracing contradiction as narrative principle pays off.</comment>
