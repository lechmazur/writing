<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage's bloodhound identity drives meaningful choices through ancestral memory awakening and the transition from finding bodies to finding the living, with embodied details like the "scarred muzzle" and failing eyes. The resolution is earned through her specific courier-dog lineage enabling magnetic navigation. Minor deductions for some abstract emotional states ("heart hammered") and the slightly convenient alignment of her exact bloodline with the solution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increases through color-coded truths building to the valley revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Sage transforms from death-finder to life-guide, with visible cost in her years of tracking corpses. The waxed leaf's preservation-to-promise arc and the howl's shift from mourning to summoning create legitimate before/after states.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Heap's tower-stacks and crushed automobiles constrain initial choices, while the hidden valley's impossible fertility charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("rust and motor oil," "cracked earth where the Mississippi once ran"). The preserved leaf and phonograph cylinder function as micro-settings that enable key discoveries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mystery (child's disappearance) through ancestral awakening to collective salvation, with the leaf's coordinates creating urgency. The "distance into closeness" riddle gains concrete meaning as Sage navigates grief-as-geography. Cost is visible in the seventeen years of death-tracking that enable her final transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the leaf's dual nature as preserved relic and living promise, with "distance isn't measured in kilometers but in grief" landing without moralizing. The final howl's transformation from mourning to summoning offers a non-literal answer to loss and connection. Subtext operates through the color-coded truths and the valley's impossible fertility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Sage's scent-based cognition ("no longer trusted her nose") and the synesthetic translation of grooves into color-tinted meaning. Voice modulates effectively from wasteland wariness to ancestral awakening. Minor deductions for occasional register elevation ("scripture," "mythology") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong sensory specificity. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("She couldn't explain how...") and some abstract emotional labeling ("extraordinary," "hammered"). The final howl image achieves strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with synesthetic navigation and the leaf-as-phonograph-writer mechanism. The concept of reading grief as geography and "translating distance into closeness" offers genuine originality. The bloodhound's transition from death-finder to life-guide transforms the tracking trope meaningfully.</comment>
