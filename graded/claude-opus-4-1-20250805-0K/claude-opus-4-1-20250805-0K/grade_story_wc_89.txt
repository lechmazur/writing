<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses ("paradoxically steady in my uncertainty") act simultaneously in scene, and her final transformation is earned through visible cost—dissolving her human form to reunite with Kess. The internal conflict between fear and certainty drives the metamorphosis believably, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation, with clear cost (loss of human form) visible on page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and mystical elements build toward the metamorphosis. However, the orientation anchors drift slightly in the middle transformation sequence, and some causal links between the spices and the specific transformation mechanics remain vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Everbloom Orchard with its permanent moon and never-falling petals creates atmospheric pressure that shapes Mira's choice. Sensory details like "stardust cinnamon" and the transformation sequence are vivid. The setting constrains choice effectively, though some spatial choreography during the transformation becomes abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reuniting with Kess) is clear from the start, and Mira's agency drives the transformation through her deliberate use of the spices. The cost—losing human form—is visible, though the escalation plateaus rather than tightens through the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of love transcending death emerges organically through Mira's transformation, culminating in Kess's resonant line "Love doesn't end with death. It just changes frequency." The final image of the fortune becoming a moth effectively reweights earlier material, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a lyrical, mystical register appropriate to the fairy-tale setting, with controlled shifts during the transformation sequence. Silverwhisper's dialogue feels natural for a guardian spirit. Some filter verbs ("Mira felt," "she heard") occasionally dull immediacy during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery like "apple blossoms glowed pearl-white under the permanent moon." Information density is generally high, though some passages during the transformation contain slight redundancies ("dissolving into the greater tapestry" followed by similar restatements). The opening and closing images effectively bracket the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a beast whisperer seeking transformation to reunite with a phoenix-consumed lover offers a fresh angle on metamorphosis stories. The specific synthesis of mystical spices and the permanent moonlight orchard creates originality, though the love-transcends-death theme itself is familiar.</comment>
