I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's poet's hunger and moral complexity drive authentic choices, particularly his decision to leave the rope for the next seeker. The layered revelations create genuine internal conflict between understanding and action. However, the energy beings lack embodied presence beyond convenience plotting, and Marcus's emotional response feels slightly managed rather than viscerally contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through temporal layering that culminates in Marcus's Earned Stasis—leaving the rope with full understanding of its weight. The closure lands with visible cost: "carrying time's texture in his bones." Each revelation deepens rather than reverses, building to the final insight about "the accumulated weight of every heart that had ever broken itself trying to choose correctly."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto functions as more than setting—its walls hold layered histories that constrain Marcus's understanding. Strong sensory work: "hemp still bearing oils from desperate hands." The Highway 61 anchor and grotto's singing walls create atmosphere. However, the energy beings' physical presence remains vague, missing opportunities for alien specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating moral complexity: wrongful imprisonment → brother's guilt → daughter's silence → judge's lifetime of compensation. Each layer tightens the ethical noose without offering resolution. The cost is legible in Marcus's final understanding that "justice and mercy were often impossible to reconcile," though the personal price Marcus pays could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the rope's history: impossible choices creating endless ripples. The final insight that poets are "foolish enough to look at impossible choices and find them beautiful" reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The energy beings' need for moral complexity creates a meta-layer about art's relationship to suffering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic sensibility: "Time had texture here, rough like the rope's weave." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("cosmic scales that could never be balanced") beyond Marcus's established roadside poet lexicon. The abstract interiority sometimes tells what could be shown through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "impossible choices" appears five times; "texture of time" recurs without evolution. Template phrasing in revelation sequences ("Now he saw..."). The final paragraph contains three restatements of the same thematic point about impossible choices.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-perception and moral complexity through the energy beings' game. The concept of creatures feeding on ethical ambiguity offers originality. The specific detail of Samuel Reeves's story grounds abstraction. However, the "poet discovers truth about time" frame echoes familiar literary territory without sufficient transformation.</comment>
