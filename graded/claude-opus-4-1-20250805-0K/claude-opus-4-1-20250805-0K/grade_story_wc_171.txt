<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between violence and "operatively gentle" patience drives authentic character complexity, with her brother's death providing clear causal motivation for her damaged-negotiator role. The final choice to expose shared grief rather than recite grievances emerges naturally from established traits. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("violence reformed into patience") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where understanding "ripples through both delegations" with the clipboard transforming from divider to connector, gathering "new light." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (tears, failures, names) build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is visible in admitting "we're not the heroes" and accepting they're "just the ones still breathing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace as memory-holder and the clipboard's ebony wood from "the last tree" effectively constrain the negotiation space and charge the final image. Twin suns casting "no shadows" during alignment provides atmospheric pressure. Setting actively shapes choices through ritual significance and spatial choreography of delegates approaching the clipboard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Mara's break from tradition ("not the traditional opening"), the delegates' physical approach to recognize ancestral names, and the final shift from "certified hatred" to "first crack." The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of failed negotiations—tightens as personal grief becomes collective recognition. Cost lands in accepting they're all "what we fought against."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the clipboard's transformation from marriage-recorder to failure-catalog, with redemption "bought with admission" rather than forgiveness. The final image of light "not red...not yet gold" offers resonant ambiguity without stating a moral. Strong integration of particulars (brother's death, three kills) that resist abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("dark-bodied and heavy, moving like grief itself") and effective modulation during Mara's speech. Some register elevation in phrases like "infinite grief" and "certified hatred" that slightly exceed the POV's established lexicon. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext, though limited in quantity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("bones singing a minor key") and good sentence variety. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("moving like grief itself," "bleeding corona," "broken music" in close succession) and occasional register drift ("operatively gentle," "certified hatred"). Information density high but moments of figurative pile-up in emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on peace negotiations through the clipboard as memory-glass holding centuries of failure. The specificity of Mara's "particular brand of damage" and crystalline-boned Theren creates memorable texture. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative ending works well, though the core forever-war premise remains somewhat familiar.</comment>
