<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal conflict between her role as healer and her own mortality creates genuine tension, particularly in "I need to show them how to find it in living with knowledge of the end." The decisive final act of creating and gifting the vinyl artwork earns its emotional weight through prior setup. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("teaching patients that music lived everywhere") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the vinyl fragment pattern culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the broken/whole circle "cracked but whole" reweights Maya's journey with visible cost. The test results create genuine urgency that tightens toward her final performance. Cost is legible in "four weeks, maybe six" and the finality of "walked toward whatever came next."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden functions as more than setting—its liminal position "suspended between earth and sky" mirrors Maya's state and the glass walls create visual stakes for her final performance. Sensory details like "scent of hope" and soundscape elements constrain and enable her artistic choices. The vinyl mounting on the garden wall charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya's terminal diagnosis creates immediate stakes that escalate through her project of transforming hospice sounds into art, culminating in the public performance where "they heard themselves reunified." The cost lands clearly in her walking away "toward whatever came next" after demonstrating how to live with "knowledge of the end." One meaningful deepening through the vinyl project that reframes death/life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The broken/whole vinyl metaphor elegantly embodies the theme without stating it—"cracked but whole" becomes the story's non-literal answer to living with mortality. "Hymning the mundane" transforms from practice to philosophy as Maya makes sacred the ordinary sounds of dying. The final image of her walking away while others breathe together offers resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Maya's musical transformation of ordinary sounds and her specific naming ("scent of hope," "hymning the mundane"). Some elevated diction ("pulsing stillness," "sprawling symphony") occasionally drifts from the intimate POV but serves the lyric mode. Dialogue remains natural and purposeful when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some elevated phrases ("ineffable rising," "sprawling symphony") create occasional register drift. Minor repetition in "pulsing stillness" used twice. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the recording sequence. The final paragraph maintains momentum despite its length.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of making music from medical equipment sounds offers a fresh angle on hospice narratives, avoiding sentimentality through specific craft details. The vinyl fragment metaphor—broken Beethoven becoming part of a new whole—transforms the familiar death/art intersection. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric mode heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
