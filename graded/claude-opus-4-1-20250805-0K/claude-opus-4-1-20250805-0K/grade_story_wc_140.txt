<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mari's motivation crystallizes through her choice to exist between legal death and physical presence, with contradictory impulses (rage at the pharmacy error vs. embracing erasure) acting simultaneously in scene. The final act of signing multiple names shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of memory" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered annotations building to Mari's recognition of her "congregation." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she signs three versions of her name, crystallizing her liminal identity with clear cost (accepting permanent dissolution). The poison label functions as persistent constraint shaping her perspective throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains movement through daily rearrangement and tide patterns, directly shaping Mari's navigation tactics. Container 47-B functions as crucial micro-setting enabling the story's central discovery. Strong sensory work with echo patterns and metal harmonics charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—from solitary ghost to discovering fellow erased beings to joining their testimony. The spring tide creates natural pressure forcing Mari's decision. Cost is legible when she signs away her singular identity to join the collective witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring motif of administrative erasure creating paradoxical freedom. The final image of "testimonies of the nameless" offers resonant answer to whether non-existence can still witness. The poison label's "texture" metaphor extends meaningfully through memory's rough/smooth/dense qualities without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Mari's ability to feel memory's texture on objects and navigate by echo patterns. Controlled psychic distance shifts during the annotation discoveries. Minor dialogue integration feels natural with proper subtext ("Living there for months before anyone noticed").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Effective variation in sentence structure and paragraph length creating tidal rhythm. Some elevated diction ("gossamer," "congregration") slightly strains in places but serves the voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error creating liminal existence with the shipping container maze as memory archive. The concept of "administrative ghosts" who perceive reality's thin spots feels earned and specific. Risk-taking in the layered annotation structure heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
