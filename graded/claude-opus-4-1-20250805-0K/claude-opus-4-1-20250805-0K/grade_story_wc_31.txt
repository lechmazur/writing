I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries, sensory details, and pattern recognition rather than strict causality. The closure arrives through density increase and revelation that reweights Marlow's understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - searching the sunken library, reading Elena's journal, accepting the luminous vows. The sister relationship provides genuine emotional weight. However, the transformation happens too smoothly without sufficient internal resistance or cost to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marlow accepts her role among the Luminous, with clear cost (Elena's dispersed consciousness). The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient revelation timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken ship's library constrains movement and discovery excellently - "bloated volumes floated in ankle-deep brine." Setting actively shapes the search and discovery. The phosphorescent masts, sky lanterns, and waterlogged environment create vivid atmosphere that directly enables the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding their synesthetic gift) escalates through journal discovery to acceptance of the luminous vows. Elena's dispersed consciousness provides genuine cost. The revelation deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for accumulative mode, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the synesthetic perception metaphor - "What we hear as color, others see as light." The concept of hiding behind truth while possessing deeper perception resonates throughout. The final image of teaching others to perceive the hidden symphony offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with synesthetic descriptions like "her sister's name rippled outward in concentric rings of deep violet." Voice maintains consistency through lyrical passages. Minor moments of elevated diction ("luminous vows," "meteor hush") occasionally drift from Marlow's working-class register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("barnacle-crusted hatch," "volumes floated in ankle-deep brine"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density - "meteor hush that pressed against her eardrums like the moment before stars fall" strains. Occasional template phrasing ("moved through," "pulled from") reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic perception society is genuinely fresh - transforms the familiar "hidden magical world" trope through specific sensory crossing. Risk-taking in the dispersed consciousness concept and the abstract nature of the Luminous society. The "hiding behind truth" paradox offers original insight into how we disguise gifts as afflictions.</comment>
