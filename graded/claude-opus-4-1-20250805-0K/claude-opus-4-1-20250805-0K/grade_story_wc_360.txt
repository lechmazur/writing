<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's personality transposition creates genuine internal complexity with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("A merchant's pragmatism wrestled with a child's wonder"). The final realization that "everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts" represents earned wisdom through specific experience, though the "seventeen different mouths" image verges on abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered borrowed personalities culminating in Mira's conceptual repricing about emotion as typography. The closure lands with conceptual cost—Mira loses her original self but gains universal understanding. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than primarily intellectual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop's crystalline walls that refract starlight into prismatic patterns across printing plates creates a micro-setting that directly enables Mira's work. The vanishing stars of constellation Empatheia constrain time and pressure choices, with the final star's defiance charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation as each borrowed personality adds complexity to Mira's internal mathematics, with the halo fragment intensifying the transposition. The dominant stake—preserving human connection through typography as stars vanish—deepens meaningfully, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of emotion as typography ("the art of arranging empty space around meaning") emerges organically from the letterpress work and reweights all prior personality borrowing. The theme avoids moralizing while offering a resonant answer about human connection through the final image of Mira smiling "with seventeen different mouths."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through mathematical metaphors for emotion ("grief multiplied by infinity, divided by the square root of abandonment") and synesthetic descriptions. The voice maintains consistency through pressure while modulating appropriately with the personality transpositions, creating purposeful uncertainty that serves the concept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The letterpress clicked in syncopation with the dying stars above"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("Their sorrow tasted like metal and ozone") enhances rather than obscures, though occasional abstraction ("lucid turbulence—perfectly clear chaos") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress printing with personality transposition and stellar extinction creates a non-obvious conceptual framework. The specific detail of messages that "changed meaning based on who read them" and ink that shifts color through the day demonstrates committed originality beyond surface novelty.</comment>
