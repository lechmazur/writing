<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vex's twelve-thousand-year weariness drives her pivotal choice to step through the dimensional door "after goodbye," with internal contradiction between immortality's prison and the possibility of transformation. The spatial mutiny crew demonstrates clear motivation rooted in opposition to the Consortium's exile plan. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("dimensional awareness") and the somewhat convenient alignment of all crew members' motivations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vex and Thorne step through the dimensional door together, choosing "what lay beyond forever" with visible cost (leaving reality behind). The causal lens holds throughout with the amulet fragments' reunion enabling the final transformation. Orientation anchors (prismatic escondite, solar storm, dimensional rifts) establish by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the crew's arrival coinciding with Vex's readiness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite functions as more than setting—its dimensional properties enable the crew's passage and the final transformation. Strong sensory work with "light bent into impossible colors" and "magnetic fields spiraled outward." The solar storm provides both atmosphere and functional cover for the mutiny. Slightly generic in places ("sheets of electromagnetic fury") but the dimensional fold concept constrains choices effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Central stake of escaping immortality's prison escalates through the crew's arrival and amulet reunification, with clear cost in choosing transformation over safety. The spatial mutiny provides external pressure while Vex's internal conflict drives the resolution. Escalation could be stronger—the middle section explains more than dramatizes the rising tension. The final choice carries weight but arrives somewhat smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation versus stagnation emerges organically through the spatial mutiny and Vex's choice to discover "what lay beyond forever." The completed amulet as doorway rather than destruction subverts expectations meaningfully. Strong resonance in the final image of the empty escondite "whispering stories." Minor deduction for slightly overt thematic statement about "curses are just possibilities they're afraid of."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with Vex, maintaining appropriate narrative distance and perceptual filtering throughout. Voice carries weight with phrases like "voice carrying the weight of hushed thunder" matching the tone requirement. Dialogue between Vex and Thorne feels purposeful if slightly formal. Some register elevation ("dimensional awareness," "spatial mutiny") occasionally pulls from the intimate POV texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("light bent into impossible colors," "swimmers through heavy water"). Information density is good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some repetitive phrasing around "dimensional" concepts and occasional overwriting ("sheets of electromagnetic fury"). The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds to closure despite minor redundancy in "beyond forever."]</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality-as-prison with dimensional travel and political rebellion creates an original framework. The spatial mutiny concept and the amulet serving as door rather than weapon show genuine ingenuity. The escondite as a fold in reality offers a memorable setting. Execution is strong though some SF elements feel familiar (dimensional rifts, electromagnetic storms).</comment>
