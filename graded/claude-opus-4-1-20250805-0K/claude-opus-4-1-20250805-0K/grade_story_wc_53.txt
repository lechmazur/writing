<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's negotiation with her ghost and the transformation from architect to memory keeper shows genuine internal contradiction and embodied cost. The ghost as temporal double creates compelling pressure, though some moments lean toward diagnostic language ("recognition that some ambitions transform rather than die"). Character arc earns its renunciation with visible cost in abandoning rebuilding dreams.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of voice fragments building toward Kira's recognition of her transformed role. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts being memory keeper rather than builder, with cost visible in eroded ambitions. The waters beginning to move again signals earned change. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words despite temporal ambiguity serving the piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Kinetic Lagoon's physics and the carousel mechanism constrain Kira's choices and charge the final image when waters resume movement. Vivid selective detail like "thermal currents kept the entire structure suspended" and voice fragments in water molecules create lived-in specificity. Setting actively shapes the story's central tension between maintaining and rebuilding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling past ambitions with present reality escalates through ghost confrontation and fragment accumulation. The carousel stopping after seventeen years creates meaningful pressure that forces Kira's stance crystallization. Cost is visible in accepting transformation rather than restoration, though middle development could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of ambition's transformation emerges organically through concrete details—the stopped carousel, collected fragments forming instructions/warnings/maps. The ghost negotiation avoids tidy resolution, embracing complexity in how success can become abandonment. Final image of waters learning to move reweights prior stasis without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Kira reads voice fragments and experiences temporal confusion. Voice modulates effectively between lyrical description and grounded observation. Some register drift occurs ("narrative time," "archaeologist of voices") but generally maintains coherent POV. Dialogue with ghost works through gesture and implication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some abstract phrasing ("fractured stillness of a story finally told") and occasional overwriting in figurative language. Information density is solid with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some template phrases ("worn those ambitions down to nothing") but momentum sustains through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating carnival, temporal confusion, and voices preserved in water molecules creates non-obvious world. The ghost as future/past self examining life choices transforms familiar haunting trope. Specific details like the carousel maintaining kinetic balance elevate beyond template post-apocalyptic scavenging.</comment>
