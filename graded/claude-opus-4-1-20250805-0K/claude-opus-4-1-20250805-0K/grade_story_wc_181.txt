<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curator's temporal vertigo and recognition of paradoxical inheritance drive meaningful choices, particularly in the bathroom sanctuary moment where vulnerability enables understanding. The final apple-eating crystallizes her acceptance of the temporal loop with visible cost ("terrible joy"). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("bewildered still but purposeful") rather than fully embodied states in transitions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and temporal paradoxes layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the curator accepts her role in the inheritance loop. The pistachio shell's transformation from mystery to understood paradox lands with conceptual cost ("terrible joy of understanding"). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words despite the surreal setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The impossible orchard constrains and enables key choices—the bathroom appears "when needed" providing sanctuary for understanding, while the asteroid setting makes temporal paradox physically manifest through "trees breathing in vacuum." Sensory detail ("magnetized boots clicking," "juice ran silver") grounds the surreal. The environment directly shapes the curator's realization about non-linear inheritance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mysterious artifact to understanding temporal paradox to accepting one's role in creating/discovering knowledge across time. The bathroom retreat represents genuine agency—choosing vulnerability to achieve clarity. Cost manifests in the "terrible joy" and acceptance of forgetting/remembering cycles, though the resolution could press harder on what specifically is lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete paradox: "inheritance follows no timeline" gains layers as the curator discovers she wrote/will write the message herself. The apple's taste "like memory, like prophecy" offers non-literal resolution to the temporal question. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "wisdom preceded its own discovery" rather than staying fully grounded in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through scientific precision ("coordinates etched...in microscopic script") meeting poetic observation ("blossoms fell upward"). Dialogue between selves maintains paradoxical clarity. Some filter phrases ("she felt," "she understood suddenly") could be more immediate, though voice coheres strongly under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The orchard shouldn't exist either—fruit trees breathing in vacuum"). Some repetitive structures appear ("She would return...She would forget...") though they serve the temporal loop theme. Figurative language occasionally strains ("juice ran silver down her chin like liquid starlight") but generally enhances rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bathroom as sanctuary for philosophical breakthrough transforms a mundane space into profound necessity—"where vulnerability met necessity." Temporal paradox rendered through physical orchard creates fresh angle on time-loop stories. The pistachio shell cameo as blank-yet-inscribed object offers genuinely original take on inheritance/knowledge transmission.</comment>
