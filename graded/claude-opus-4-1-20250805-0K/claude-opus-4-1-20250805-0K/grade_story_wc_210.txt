<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and his transformation of memory-essence demonstrates agency, but internal conflict remains largely abstract rather than embodied in scene. The final choice to transform rather than escape shows earned renunciation with visible cost (the town's rebirth requiring his permanent commitment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory-essence accumulates and transforms through Silas into the town's potential. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the town's rebirth and Silas's acceptance of his role, though the cost could be more viscerally felt. The wish-magic setup and alchemical transformation create coherent causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove's jellyfish create a distinctive atmosphere that mirrors the story's themes of light/memory. The amber bottle and memory-essence constrain Silas's choices and charge the final image of synchronized jellyfish heartbeat. Setting actively shapes the transformation method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring vs. abandoning the town) escalates through Silas's choice to absorb rather than shatter the bottle, with the transformation process showing deepening commitment. Cost appears in his permanent binding to the town, though the pressure could tighten more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of authentic struggle versus false comfort emerges through the town's history and Silas's rejection of the easy path. The final image of jellyfish pulsing like a heartbeat offers resonant answer about collective renewal through individual courage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward exposition ("Other alchemists scorned his work"). The perceptual signature of an exiled alchemist comes through in how he reads essence and possibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong imagery but contains scaffold phrases ("Now he stood," "For hours he stood") and some abstract telling about hope and possibility. The transformation sequence relies on summary rather than moment-by-moment embodiment, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of memory-essence that transforms rather than preserves offers fresh angle on revival stories. The synthesis of alchemical practice with town restoration feels specific, though the execution leans on familiar redemption patterns.</comment>
