I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Syln's characterization succeeds through concrete contradictions—ancient titan serving as humble librarian, immense power expressed through quiet ink-making. The pretender's false composure cracking when confronted with the pellet reveals character under pressure. Minor deduction for the true heir arriving without sufficient embodiment or cost shown on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to confrontation. Closure lands as Decisive Change when the pellet shatters and truth spreads through the library. Cost appears somewhat abstract—"false glory crumbled" lacks visceral weight. The orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library drifting between dimensions with time measured in constellation pauses creates genuine constraint on the narrative. Iron gall pellets function as micro-setting that directly enables the closure. The crystalline dome and wheeling stars charge the temporal stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cryptic discovery through urgent warnings to direct confrontation. The pretender breaching the drift itself creates genuine pressure. However, the final confrontation resolves too easily—the pretender simply flees rather than fighting, reducing the cost of victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of false grandeur versus quiet truth-keeping. The iron gall pellets crystallizing truth into material form provides concrete metaphor. The ending's return to ink-making after kingdoms fall resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains mythic distance appropriate to the scope while filtering through Syln's ancient perspective. "Her fingers, gnarled but steady" and similar details ground the POV. Dialogue between Syln and pretender carries effective subtext about legitimacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong clarity with varied rhythm—short declarations like "Nothing dies here" punctuate longer descriptive passages. Information density stays high throughout. Minor repetition of "false" in the closing paragraph slightly weakens the finale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a library drifting between dimensions as repository of truth offers fresh angle on succession disputes. Iron gall pellets crystallizing legal precedent into material form shows genuine invention. The setup follows recognizable fantasy patterns but executes with specific detail.</comment>
