<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradictions manifest through concrete embodied reactions (trembling fingers, laughter with the bridges) and her motivation to understand time's texture drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to walk the hyperbolic bridges despite the cost. The final renunciation of the halo fragment shows earned change with visible cost as she dissolves her anchor to the past.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost as Elara transforms from trapped by time to becoming its gardener, with the dissolving halo fragment marking irreversible change. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks (fading photographs, geometric bridges, crystalline time) that reweight her relationship to temporal experience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden functions as both setting and constraint, with hyperbolic geometry enabling Elara's passage through temporal dimensions and the vines' recognition forcing her confrontation with multiple selves. The tactile description of time's texture ("rough like bark, soft like moss") and the bridges' impossible architecture directly shape her ability to access and understand temporal flow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural deepening as each interaction with the bridges reveals more layers of temporal imprisonment, from seeing other iterations to feeling time's granular texture to the final dissolution. The cost becomes unmistakable as the halo fragment's disintegration takes "one of her other selves" with each particle, though the middle section could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of time as cultivated rather than discovered emerges organically through garden metaphors ("memory grows wild if untended") without explicit moralizing, culminating in the resonant final image of Elara as time's gardener. The conceptual repricing that time has texture because it's "made of discrete moments" reweights all prior design attempts as acts of temporal creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's designer's eye viewing time spatially ("passages that led both forward and backward") and the controlled rhythm accelerates toward dissolution, though some passages drift into elevated register ("quaking reverie of creation"). The lyric compression serves the accumulative mode effectively despite occasional opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs (the bridges simultaneously setting, metaphor, and mechanism), though register drift appears in phrases like "retrocognitive imprisonment" and "hyperbolic geometry" that clash with the otherwise organic voice. Some paraphrase loops occur around time's texture being crystalline/granular/sharp-edged, and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy ("she'd come to understand").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of garden design with temporal mechanics offers a fresh angle on time-loop narratives, with the specific innovation that gardens are attempts to give "physical form to temporal sensation." The risk of using hyperbolic geometry as literal rather than metaphorical space pays off in allowing tactile interaction with time's substance.</comment>
