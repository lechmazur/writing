<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choice between ancient bell and modern siren embodies genuine internal conflict with clear cost—she risks disbelief but trusts inherited wisdom. Her sensory attunement ("vibration in the stone floor," listening "with her whole body") creates specific embodiment under pressure. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the glue drying exactly when needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change: Mara shifts from passive observer to active guardian by choosing the bell over automated systems, with villages saved as visible cost proof. Causal lens holds throughout—her grandmother's teachings enable recognition of "deep silence," which triggers the bell choice. The avalanche's tectonic origin cleverly validates her instrument readings while subverting weather expectations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's elevation ("five thousand feet above the cloud layer") and sensory details ("hemp fibers rough beneath her fingers") effectively constrain choice—only the bell's ancient authority can penetrate doubt. Setting actively pressures through vanished cats and fled ravens. Deduction for some geographic vagueness in the valleys below and slightly generic mountain descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine testing to catastrophic decision as Mara recognizes the "storms of legend" pattern, with clear cost in risking false alarm versus mass casualties. The tension between perfect weather and instrument warnings creates genuine pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when she must choose between trusted automation and uncertain tradition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between modern technology and ancestral wisdom without explicit moralizing—the layered warning "honored both old wisdom and new technology." The final image of ice crystals chiming "like a thousand tiny bells" resonates without stating meaning. Slight deduction for the somewhat neat resolution of "they would understand."]</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision ("microclimate variations," "barometric data") appropriate to Mara's expertise while allowing lyrical moments ("solstice hush"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some filter verb accumulation ("she detected," "she could see") dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between technical observation and urgent action. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in consecutive sentences and some scaffolding phrases ("According to mountain tradition," "In her three years of service").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster-warning genre with spiritual/ancient wisdom creates non-obvious tension. The avalanche's tectonic rather than weather origin subverts expectations effectively. The specific detail of "glue drying on newly repaired warning system" grounds the fantastical setting. Some derivative elements in the wise grandmother trope.</comment>
