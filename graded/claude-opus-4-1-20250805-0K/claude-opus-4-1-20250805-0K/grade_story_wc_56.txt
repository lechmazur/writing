I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is primarily an Accumulative/Textural piece with Causal elements. The story builds through layered reflection and discovery, with the sundial's revelation serving as a crystallizing moment that reweights Mara's entire quest. The closure operates through Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Charged Poise) where Mara's recognition of her own reflection in Van der Meer's confession reconfigures her understanding with clear emotional cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from external seeking to self-recognition is well-motivated through concrete details like her father's deceptions. The final choice to confront her past shows clear cost through "salvage truth from her own past." Minor deduction for some therapeutic self-awareness ("she'd been looking forward when the answer required looking back") that slightly dulls the rawness of discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's recognition transforms her understanding with visible emotional cost ("finally able to see what had always been there"). The accumulative structure builds effectively through the sundial discovery to self-recognition. Slight deduction for predictable thematic arc once the father's deception is revealed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amsterdam's twilight canals create effective atmosphere with selective details like "mirror-black water" and the Magere Brug. The sundial functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. However, the setting could more actively pressure the revelation rather than serving primarily as contemplative backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding truth versus lies—deepens through the sundial's revelation to Mara's recognition of her own avoidance. Cost is legible in her decision to return home and confront her father. The conflict lacks immediate external pressure but maintains internal coherence under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Van der Meer's confession paralleling Mara's father's deceptions, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "every legend she'd sought had been a mirror" resonates without stating a thesis. Minor deduction for slightly neat resolution of the truth/lies dichotomy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive voice through archaeological expertise ("fingers to read surfaces like braille"). Some elevated diction in reflective passages ("architecture of lies," "serene upheaval") fits the contemplative mode. Slight register elevation in peak moments but maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some repetitive structures appear ("She'd found...," "She'd spent..."). Information density is good but occasional abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval complete itself") and mild redundancy in thematic statements reduce momentum. No major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological mystery with personal reckoning, avoiding typical treasure-hunt resolution. The parallel between Van der Meer's colonial crimes and modern ethical sourcing adds specificity. The concept of legends as mirrors for self-avoidance offers genuine insight, though execution occasionally relies on familiar introspection patterns.</comment>
