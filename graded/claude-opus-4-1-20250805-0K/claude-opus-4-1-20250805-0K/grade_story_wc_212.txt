<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between responsibility and power manifests through embodied details like "furiously tranquil precision" and "wild serenity," with her final choice to reopen the garden earned through generational causality. The transformation from keeper to inheritor shows genuine cost in accepting the weight of causality itself, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("compressed time itself") rather than staying grounded in sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through seed descriptions and temporal layering until the Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira reopens the sealed garden, accepting the inheritance's weight. The cost is legible in "responsibility" and the risk of "unraveling causality," with the acorn cap constraining tactics throughout as the only key to access the vortex.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and its transformation into living wood constrains Mira's choices, while specific seeds (Cherokee Purple tomatoes, Glass Gem corn) carry embodied history that shapes her understanding. The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting that enables the central action, and the crystalline dome's interaction with starlight charges the final image of "timeless soil."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving seeds to wielding reality-altering power, with the acorn cap's revelation tightening options to a single path forward. The cost of "unraveling causality itself if wielded carelessly" is explicit, though the resolution lacks a visceral trade-off beyond accepting responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation requiring transformation, with seeds as compressed time offering a non-literal answer about inheritance as "continuation" rather than possession. The final oak that "would remember both past and future" reweights the opening's static preservation into active cultivation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature filters everything through botanical and temporal metaphors ("velvet worn smooth," "entropy from chaos"), maintaining consistency even under pressure. Some passages lean heavily on abstract concepts ("borrowed time," "temporal drift") that could be more grounded in sensory experience, though the voice remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("ice coating the atrium walls began to sublime directly into vapor") but suffers from abstract density in places ("compressed time itself," "localized pockets of spacetime"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the inheritance concept being explained multiple ways, and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy ("she felt," "she understood").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-saving with time manipulation offers a fresh angle on inheritance narratives, with specific varieties (Dragon Tongue beans, Moon and Stars watermelon) avoiding generic symbolism. The concept of seeds containing "compressed time" and an oak that "learned to remember the future" shows genuine imaginative reach, though some elements feel derivative of portal fantasy conventions.</comment>
