<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between his complicity in manufacturing lies and confronting his grandfather's crimes creates genuine contradictory impulses, particularly in "he realized he'd inherited more than just the family silence." The final choice to destroy his business shows earned cost through prior causality, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elias's decision to close his business and leave the carvings as testimony shows clear on-page cost in "Some weights, he understood now, could only be lifted by setting them down completely." The accumulative/textural lens holds as driftwood fragments build toward revelation, though the grandfather's crimes revelation feels slightly convenient in timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood carvings function beyond mere setting—they constrain Elias's choices and charge the final image when he "placed the watch hand among them." The forgotten shore's isolation reinforces the theme of buried histories, though some descriptive phrases like "bruised purples" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each carving reveals deeper complicity: dates become coordinates, then refugee boats, then family knowledge. The cost is legible in Elias's choice to destroy his livelihood, though the stakes could intensify more sharply between discovery and decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the parallel between grandfather's betrayals and Elias's own "corrupt bargain: trading truth for comfort." The final image of leaving both watch hand and carvings offers a non-literal answer about confronting inherited guilt without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and effective perceptual signature in details like "sieved hush" and how Elias reads the carvings professionally. Some phrases like "tempered regret" feel slightly mannered, and occasional register elevation ("museum of tempered regret") doesn't fully match the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("bruised purples," "museum of tempered regret") and occasional redundancy ("false memories"/"false genealogies"). The paraphrase loop in "manufactured memories" concept appears multiple times without significant variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on inherited guilt through the genealogist profession creates organic connection between personal and professional corruption. The specific detail of refugee boat coordinates and the parallel between grandfather's crimes and Elias's work shows genuine synthesis, though the revelation mechanism feels slightly convenient.</comment>
