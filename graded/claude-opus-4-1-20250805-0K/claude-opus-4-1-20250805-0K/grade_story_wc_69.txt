<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen's resignation interweaves with determination through concrete embodied details ("traced the mother-of-pearl inlay"), and her final choice to pass on the rosette carries visible cost of letting go. The students' arrival and collaborative discovery of the five modes reveals character through action under the pressure of institutional loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the arts persist through human gathering rather than institutional support, with the rosette transformed from personal artifact to communal inheritance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (students arriving with instruments, finding the modes together) to reweight the opening resignation into active transmission with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library's sound-absorbing quality creates atmosphere while the zither's rosette with five cranes becomes a concrete constraint driving the collaborative discovery. Sensory details filter through Chen's perspective ("voice thin and ancient through the rosette's carved opening"), though some descriptions lean generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts against institutional abandonment—escalates from solitary resignation to collective action as students arrive to learn the modes. The cost appears in Chen giving away her grandfather's zither rosette, though the middle section could tighten pressure between arrival and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that arts vanish "when people stop gathering to practice them," not through institutional abandonment. The five modes transform from authentic Chinese music into "something new from something vanishing," and the final image of dispersed humming in "five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized" offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent reflective distance with selective perception ("autumn leaves absorb rain"), though some passages drift toward abstract register ("traveled stillness"). Dialogue feels natural when it appears, and the piece teaches its lyrical compression early, but occasional therapy-speak intrusions ("unlearning hatred") weaken specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("mother-of-pearl inlay," "velvet library absorbed sound") but suffers from abstract phrases like "traveled stillness" and "expectantly resigned" that resist concrete meaning. Some paraphrase loops appear ("vanishing arts vanish"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy during the collaborative music-making.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of diverse musical traditions through collaborative discovery offers fresh angle on cultural preservation, avoiding simple East-West binaries. The specific detail of five crane modes that "no one alive could play anymore" becoming accessible through collective effort transforms the familiar "dying tradition" narrative.</comment>
