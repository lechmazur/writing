<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kira's transformation from brittle awakening to understanding coexistence is earned through concrete details like the sundial's atomic reflection showing her fractured selves. The internal contradiction between isolation and independence plays out through embodied moments—pressing her palm to the sundial, feeling the hum in her sternum. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "extinct wisdom" and "paradox" in the final paragraph that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories, reflections, and the stone circle's hum build toward Kira's realization about coexistence over recreation. The closure—shifting from brittle isolation to choosing coexistence—lands with conceptual cost shown through the shadow she finally casts. The orientation anchors (Tidal Library, Kira, three months post-awakening) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Tidal Library's atmospheric tides and glass floor over clouds create a liminal space that mirrors Kira's suspended state between past and present. The brass sundial functions as micro-setting, its "atomically reflective surface" fragmenting her identity and ultimately marking "not hours but epochs." The stone circle's hum physically drives the transformation, vibrating through building and body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—deepens through Kira's recognition that scattered anachronisms must "coexist with absence" rather than recreate the past. The stone circle's intensifying hum creates coherent pressure toward this crystallization. Cost appears in accepting the loss of her mammoth-herder identity while finding purpose in carrying forward extinct wisdom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sundial's impossible existence (brass-working post-dating mammoths) and Kira's paradoxical state as a "contemporary of extinction." The final image of the sundial marking epochs rather than hours resonantly answers the question of how to bear ancient memory in modern bodies. Minor deduction for explicit thematic statement "We weren't preserved to recreate the past" that could trust the imagery more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric-philosophical register appropriate to Kira's scholar-mystic perspective, with selective perception focused on temporal paradoxes and atomic surfaces. Dialogue between Kira and Marcus advances understanding naturally. Some filter phrases ("she saw," "understanding flooding") slightly dull immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control in passages like "brittle and sharp three months ago when the ancient stone circle beneath the library began its eternal hum." However, abstract phrasing clusters in places ("extinct wisdom," "paradox," "anachronisms") and some repetitive constructions around memory and time. The final paragraph contains philosophical abstraction that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of reincarnated specialists from extinct eras discovering they must "coexist with absence" rather than recreate the past offers a fresh angle on memory and purpose. The brass sundial's atomic reflection showing temporal selves is inventive. The transformation from brittle to diamond metaphor and the library breathing with atmospheric tides show originality in execution.</comment>
