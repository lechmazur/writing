Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate each category systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered memories and crystalline imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where collective remembering becomes an act of creation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation coheres around preserving humanity through memory, with concrete embodiment in her touching crystals and feeling the weight of the present moment. The "preemptive nostalgia" drives meaningful micro-choices, though internal conflict could deepen beyond philosophical contemplation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when survivors gather to "remember together," transforming memory-keeping from preservation to active creation with visible cost (90% of humanity sealed away). The accumulative lens holds consistently through crystalline memories building toward collective ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choices (only high peaks remain accessible) and the crystal forecourt functions as both repository and stage for the final gathering. Sensory detail effectively filters through Lyra's archivist perspective, particularly the "silent theater" of lightning below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal reflection to collective survival through memory, with the fog-stone transformation creating irreversible pressure. The deepening understanding that "consciousness of loss...made them human" meaningfully reweights the dominant stake, though more concrete opposition would strengthen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "preemptive nostalgia" - awareness that every moment is already becoming memory. The final image of "becoming" through collective remembering offers a non-literal answer to identity formation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the reflective tone, with controlled modulation like "breath visible in the thin mountain air." Some passages edge toward purple prose ("alabaster seas," "amnesiac world") but generally serve the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "memory/remember" that accumulates meaning. However, several abstract philosophical passages ("conjecture...imagine who we were to sculpt identity") and elevated diction clusters reduce immediacy. The "ancient fire" ending risks cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fog-stone transformation offers a fresh apocalyptic premise, and "preemptive nostalgia" provides an original emotional angle. However, the memory-crystal repository feels somewhat familiar, and the resolution through collective ritual doesn't fully transform the archetype.</comment>
