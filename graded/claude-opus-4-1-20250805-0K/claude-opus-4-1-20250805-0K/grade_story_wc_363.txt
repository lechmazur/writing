<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's motivation crystallizes through embodied sacrifice—each memory feeding the raveling silence carries specific sensory weight (daughter's fever, small body against chest). The final choice lands with earned causality, though some middle passages lean on exposition rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward Mei's sacrifice, with the amber bead's transformation marking clear before/after. Cost is visible in her lost memories and inability to recall her name, though the daughter's rescue feels slightly convenient without showing the mechanism of how the message achieved this.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bamboo-swallowed orchard creates atmospheric pressure, with the portable loom as micro-setting constraining choice. Sensory hierarchy works well (filtered light, raveling silence), though some passages default to visual over other senses that might sharpen the weaving scenes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through generational sacrifice pattern to Mei's personal cost, with meaningful deepening as she understands the price. The tension between saving her daughter and losing herself tightens effectively, though the resolution's mechanics (how exactly the message reaches and saves) remain vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the lineage of women sacrificing memory for connection, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Mei pressing the new amber bead into the investigator's palm resonates as proof that "some silences speak louder than words," though the trafficking subplot introduces late complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice modulates between lyrical passages ("raveling silence") and concrete observation, with clean POV control. Some register elevation in peak moments ("latent sacrifice," "impossible distance") slightly exceeds Mei's established lexicon without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("each strand of this unmaking carried something away") but suffers from occasional paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing. The "stoically sparkling" repetition works as pattern, though some passages could compress without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of weaving messages through reality's fabric by sacrificing memories offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The generational loom and accumulating cost create non-obvious stakes, though the trafficking element feels slightly grafted rather than organic to the magical realism frame.</comment>
