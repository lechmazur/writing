I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and consistent—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—with concrete embodiment through his gait recognition ability and patient observation. The final choice to give away the zodiac coin shows genuine character cost, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("wisdom traveled best in whispers").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of whispered knowledge culminating in Chen's recognition of Marcus's system. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Chen accepts the coin and Marcus's proven methodology, with visible cost in the years of dismissed warnings now validated. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, though the closure's thematic articulation ("wisdom traveled best in whispers") weakens the otherwise strong ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains navigation during the electromagnetic storm, making Marcus's acoustic mapping essential. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"metallic groaning," "aurora borealis painted green fire"—with the container maze functioning as both obstacle and acoustic architecture that enables the story's central proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispered warnings' effectiveness—escalates through the medical supply crisis that forces Chen to rely on Marcus's methods. The geomagnetic storm creates genuine pressure by disabling GPS, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with Chen's immediate conversion after one successful navigation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—Marcus's whispered reports marked on containers, the acoustic amphitheater discovery—rather than abstraction. However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("wisdom traveled best in whispers") undermines the otherwise earned thematic resonance, committing the Thematic Echo error.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical competence with Marcus's maintenance worker perspective coloring perception ("heel-heavy stride," "rolling gait"). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and goal-pursuit, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("labyrinth groaned around them") that slightly exceeds the POV's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates solid clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("painted green fire across the corrugated walls while compasses spun wildly") and occasional template phrasing ("Marcus had worked... Marcus kept... Marcus pulled out") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of navigation through gait recognition during electromagnetic failure offers genuine freshness, transforming the familiar "underdog proves worth" arc through specific occupational detail. The acoustic mapping system and whispered warnings create memorable specificity, though the resolution's tidiness prevents full originality.</comment>
