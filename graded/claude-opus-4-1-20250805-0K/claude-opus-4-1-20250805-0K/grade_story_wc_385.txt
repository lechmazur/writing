I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor assessing for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered voices, echoes, and resonances toward a transformation where pattern density reweights meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Senna's motivation crystallizes through embodied perception ("bones ache with recognition") and the final choice between individual existence and eternal chorus carries genuine cost. The contradiction between keeping her voice versus joining the universal song plays out in scene, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("vast and eternal").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Senna's transformation into echo reweights the entire premise - the disappeared aren't victims but chosen translators. The cost is visceral: "leaving everything behind—her life, her form, her individual voice." The accumulative lens holds as voices layer toward the transformation, though early orientation could be slightly cleaner.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon functions as both setting and instrument, constraining who can become echo singers and enabling the transformation. "The canyon walls knew Senna's voice better than she knew herself" establishes immediate POV-filtered perception. The serpentine nexus creates the acoustic phenomenon necessary for the choice, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mystery to existential choice as the shell reveals the pattern of disappearances and Senna faces joining or refusing the eternal chorus. The melancholy of understanding ("sorrow, not joy") deepens pressure, and the final transformation carries clear cost of individual identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of echo singers as universe translators, avoiding abstraction. The final image of Senna singing herself into echo while leaving "the faintest whisper of melancholy" resonantly answers why some people echo without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature established immediately with "The canyon walls knew Senna's voice." POV remains tightly controlled through Senna's acoustic perception, with purposeful compression in lyric moments like "reed-blown and hollow" that enhance rather than obscure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("serpentine nexus," "layered like sediment") but occasional abstraction ("vast and eternal," "between dimensions") and some repetitive structures in the middle section. The paraphrase of "echo singers weren't taken; they were chosen" restates without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of acoustic transformation as dimensional translation offers a fresh angle on disappearance stories. The specific detail of voices echoing differently based on undefined qualities creates originality, though the revelation mechanism through grandmother's letter follows familiar patterns.</comment>
