<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction that drives her decisive choice to use mainland knowledge for community preservation. The foundation stone chip functions as both embodied memory and final symbolic integration. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("painful clarity," "hopeful desperation") rather than fully embodied states during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with graffiti patterns building toward Maya's reorganization solution that transforms threat into protection. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the community becomes "unbreakable" through legal incorporation, with cost visible in Maya's navigation between worlds. Orientation anchors (raft city, three generations, Maya's role) establish cleanly within opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city's perpetual carnival atmosphere creates vivid sensory detail ("oil-drum fires and neon signs") while the graffiti system constrains how the community can respond. Setting directly shapes the preservation strategy—the carnival becomes the shield. Foundation stone chip bridges old/new worlds and charges the final incorporation moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from graffiti warning through developer arrival to community mobilization, with Maya's choice narrowing from negotiation vs. resistance to creative synthesis. Cost is visible in the transformation required—becoming "something they can't buy." One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes legal framework can protect cultural chaos.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-transformation emerges organically from Maya's synthesis of both worlds, avoiding simple binaries. The graffiti's dual meaning (resistance for residents, folk art for outsiders) embodies thematic complexity. Final image of "STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE" resonates without moralizing, though "hopeful desperation" edges toward theme-labeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Maya reads walls and navigates platforms "with practiced ease." Voice maintains consistent register though peaks toward mild elevation ("ungoverned and ungovernable"). Some filter-verb clustering ("Maya watched," "Maya stood," "Maya began") reduces immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some template cadence appears ("Maya watched...Maya stood...Maya began"). Minor paraphrase loop with "reorganize" concept stated then restated. Information density strong in graffiti translations but occasional abstraction ("painful clarity," "hopeful desperation") reduces specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification resistance through carnival preservation and graffiti-as-legal-framework. The dual-language solution (resistance code for insiders, folk art for outsiders) shows genuine ingenuity. Specific details like "wave generators" and "sealed drums" ground the floating world convincingly.</comment>
