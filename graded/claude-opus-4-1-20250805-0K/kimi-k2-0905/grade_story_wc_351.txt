<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to resurrect abandoned dreams through dangerous neural modification is consistently rendered through embodied details like "screwdrivers turn left when she meant right" and the calibration scene's physical precision. The choice to risk motor cortex overwriting for the chance to "map every buried wish" shows genuine internal conflict between ambition and self-preservation. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of the miners' voices section, though the return to Mara's singular consciousness lands with appropriate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's partial success—she gains the sketches but loses the full dream extraction, establishing clear before/after with visible cost (blood, burned-out mirror). The causal chain from childhood sensitivity through the helmet modification to the moon's angle shift maintains coherent linkage. Deduction for the somewhat compressed middle section where the miners' memories could use one more beat of concrete detail to fully earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon functions as more than setting—its quartz veins containing entangled memories directly constrain Mara's choices and methods, while the iron rail and cliff edge create physical stakes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "cold light," "fractures reflecting lunar silver," "red grit." The broken periscope mirror's precise angle requirement elegantly ties environment to consequence. Strong spatial choreography throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk (motor cortex overwriting) through the helmet activation to the moon's sliding light forcing premature disconnection. The milliradian precision requirement creates genuine tension, and Mara pays visible costs (blood, lost opportunity). However, the middle section with the miners' voices could generate more resistance or complication before the moon shifts—the transformation feels slightly too smooth before the reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archaeology metaphor works throughout, from excavating dreams as data to the final image of "new seams of quartz" ready for the next dreamer. The theme of incomplete resurrection despite technological ambition emerges through action rather than statement. Deduction for the slightly overt phrasing "archaeology of abandoned dreams" appearing multiple times, and the miners' section trending toward the abstract rather than maintaining concrete particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with distinctive phrases like "helix-minded," "chaotically precise," and the controlled technical register fitting an engineer's consciousness. The prose modulates effectively during the helmet sequence, compressing during peak intensity. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("fruition," "inextricable") that slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon during non-technical moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong opening ("helix-minded engineer") and varied sentence structures. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several instances of repetitive phrasing ("chaotically precise" appears three times, "abandoned dreams" four times) create mild loops. The phrase "archaeology of abandoned dreams" in particular becomes scaffolding. Some filter verbs in the middle section ("she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of mining consortium dreams stored in canyon quartz as quantum drill coolant offers genuine originality. The specific risk calculation (milliradian precision affecting motor cortex) and the helix-mind trait create memorable character specificity. Deduction for the somewhat familiar "failed experiment but gains partial knowledge" resolution pattern, though the execution remains distinctive.</comment>
