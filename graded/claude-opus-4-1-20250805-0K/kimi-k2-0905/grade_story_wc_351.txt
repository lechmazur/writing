I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and memory accretion toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara accepts partial failure while gaining fragmentary dreams.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like "screwdrivers turn left when she meant right." The internal conflict between risking motor cortex overwrite versus mapping buried wishes creates genuine tension. Her final acceptance of partial success with "chaotically precise hunger" shows earned transformation, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("helix-minded" remains more label than embodied trait).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (blood, burned-out mirror, dreams turned to dust) as Mara gains sketches she doesn't remember drawing. The accumulative structure coheres through the canyon's memory-storage premise. Minor orientation delay (who/where clarifies gradually) and some causality softness around how exactly the helmet enables memory extraction prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon functions as both setting and mechanism, with quartz veins storing memories that constrain Mara's choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cold light," "red grit," "copper lace"). The mirror angle's milliradian precision creates spatial stakes. The setting actively shapes the climax when moonlight's shift causes system collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk (motor cortex overwrite) through the helmet sequence to the collapse when moonlight shifts. The dominant stake—recovering abandoned dreams—tightens when the angle requirement proves unsustainable. Cost is visible in blood and equipment loss, though the middle section's pressure could intensify more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of dreams as extractable data stored in stone. The final image of Mara carrying sketches while the canyon awaits "the next dreamer" offers a non-literal answer about partial recovery and persistent hunger. Subtext operates through images like "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent texture through compound constructions and technical-poetic fusion ("synthetic neurotrophin," "synaptic plasticity gone feral"). POV control is clean with selective perception reflecting engineering mindset. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("cold fire crawled over her skull") but largely serve the quaking reverie tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Information unfolds efficiently through action. However, some metaphorical density in peak beats ("helical, tightening until she could not tell which longing belonged to whom") and occasional abstract phrasing ("chaotically precise déjà vu") create minor opacity without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of dreams as coolant data stored in canyon walls offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of mining, neuroscience, and archaeology creates an organic world-logic. Specific details like "periscope glass salvaged from a submarine graveyard" avoid generic sci-fi, though some elements feel slightly derivative of memory-extraction narratives.</comment>
