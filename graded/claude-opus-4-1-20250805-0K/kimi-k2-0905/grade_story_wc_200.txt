<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details—pressing the tooth to her lips as "habit older than her name" and her "modestly fearless heart ticking like a quiet metronome." The transformation of the giggle from spectral confession to "small sun learning how to shine without burning" behind her ribs shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for the child's appearance reading slightly convenient, but the core arc of collector integrating lost laughter lands with specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery until the closure's Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara integrating the laughter transforms her from collector to carrier. The cost is visceral: "warm salt water that smelled of pine and birthday cake" dissolving the tooth, her protective talisman. Who/where/when anchored immediately ("Echo Gorge," "dawn," "lost soul collector"), and the pattern of spectral confessions → harp interaction → integration holds causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as active constraint—its stone throat "swallowing confessions" creates the spectral ribbons Elara must collect, while the warped harp between boulders becomes the crucial tool for the giggle's capture. The crocodile tooth's "serrated edge catching the first blade of light" and later dissolving into "warm salt water" shows object-as-setting constraining choice. Sensory specificity excels: "sour chords that bent memories," "luminous ache that traveled the wire."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting the drowned child's giggle—escalates through the harp's interference ("lured by the harp's warped lullaby") forcing Elara to risk using her protective tooth. The deepening occurs when contact produces "a shiver of light" that transforms the giggle from fleeing sound to "round face of a boy." Cost is legible: losing the tooth to integrate the laughter, with other splinters "beginning to stir" suggesting future obligation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of collecting "splinters" of laughter that "cracked inside them and never healed"—healing requires accepting wrong notes and broken things. The final image of Elara's "footprints glowing faintly with the luminous ache" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "modestly fearless heart" as courage to carry others' pain. The dissolved tooth becoming "pine and birthday cake" captures loss and sweetness simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through selective perception—Elara experiences the gorge as "a throat of stone" and confessions as "pale ribbons," establishing her synesthetic relationship to souls. The prose modulates effectively from lyrical opening to tense pursuit ("flickered away") to transcendent resolution. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "luminous ache that traveled the wire" but the perceptual signature of sensing laughter as physical objects remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful density—"modestly fearless heart ticking like a quiet metronome against the ribs of dawn" does triple work establishing character, mood, and time. Information density high throughout, though "colors no tongue could name" edges toward cliché. The syntactic variety from long opening sentence to short "The giggle heard its own reflection and paused, quivering" creates effective rhythm. Some mild overwriting in peak moments but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of a soul collector gathering "splinters" of laughter rather than whole souls offers genuine freshness, executed through specific world-building (spectral confessions as "pale ribbons," the warped harp that "bent memories"). The synthesis of predator imagery (crocodile tooth) with healing work, and the child's laughter manifesting as both "dripping and cold" yet ultimately warm, shows non-obvious complexity. Risk-taking in the lyrical density pays off (+0.3 within band).</comment>
