<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Lira's scheme evolving from manipulation to self-confrontation when the shadow-double forces her to metabolize her own unopened anger. The soldier and girl's cellular memories (bandaging dog, stolen strawberries) create specific, visceral transformations. Minor deduction for the shadow-Lira's slightly abrupt emergence without sufficient groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught reality shifts and cellular memory accumulation building to Lira's self-confrontation and the shared stillness closure. The shadow-double reversal at "You think you can teach release without first learning it?" creates meaningful cost when Lira must accept her own buried resentments. The final image of three silhouettes against a forgetting horizon with the broken music box left behind completes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary's breathing walls and shifting architecture constrain choices effectively—reality "reappears when needed" creates rules that shape Lira's approach. Strong micro-setting work with the broken music box pins creating phantom bars and skipped-record repetition. Slightly generic "soundless sanctuary" descriptor prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: soldier's memory → girl's strawberries → shadow-Lira demanding reciprocal release → Lira accepting her own resentments. The cost is legible when she feels "bricks of fear restacking" and must metabolize the bombs she hated others for dropping. The final shared stillness shows clear foreclosure of the manipulative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the broken music box's "lesson intact" despite producing no sound—the teaching lies in "willingness to keep turning the damaged wheel." The cellular memory concept creates fresh specificity around how kindness and harm metabolize into the same carbon. Final image of the box reappearing "when needed by someone else scheming peace" resonantly reweights the entire premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with phrases like "walls breathed, floors forgot their angles" and "juice running like forgotten rivers down her chin." Clean focalization through Lira with no head-hopping. Some register elevation ("calculus of vengeance," "metabolize into carbon") slightly strains the POV's established voice during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"uniform still smoldering, eyes hollow with the moment a sniper erased his future." Some template cadence in the middle section with repeated "Lira [verb]" constructions. Excellent final line about the box's "pins still broken, its lesson intact" charges the closure without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cellular memory mechanism for releasing war-ghosts through pre-war kindness offers genuine freshness. The shadow-double as externalized self-resentment transforms the helper-archetype predictably but the specific execution through "unopened crates of anger labeled with other people's names" elevates. Risk-taking with the reality-shifting sanctuary pays off coherently.</comment>
