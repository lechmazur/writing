<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's choice to harmonize discord rather than complete it shows genuine internal complexity, and his final acceptance of incompleteness as "the only doorway beauty knows" represents earned wisdom through concrete experience. The woman with the zither applies subtle pressure that forces micro-choices (giving her the feather, tuning her string), though her appearance feels slightly convenient despite adding texture to the central meditation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the spiral-drawing, musical collaboration, and dissolution sequence that reweights incompleteness from wound to doorway. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when "Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use" transforms the opening's fractured edges into necessary passages, with cost visible in the "net of almosts to keep him gently, imperfectly, alive." Minor orientation wobble with the woman's arrival but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, tide, and shore objects (crescent shell, clouded sea glass, broken soldier) create a lived-in setting where each fragment contributes to the "chord so tense it trembled." The drake feather's torn vane becomes setting-as-constraint, enabling the spiral drawing that gathers "every broken thing." Physical choreography stays clear through the water-walking and zither-tuning sequences.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding beauty in incompleteness—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, from the torn feather through the broken zither string to the kite's frayed tail "streaming three separate colors." The poet's agency manifests in harmonizing discord (tuning the broken string, drawing the spiral), though the woman's arrival introduces coincidence that slightly softens earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: the torn feather that "caught light only at the fractured edges," the buzzing string transformed to sigh, the three-colored kite tail braiding into sunrise. The final erasure becoming "part of the woven dawns" offers a non-literal answer that incompleteness enables continuation rather than closure, avoiding any moralizing while maintaining resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how the poet notices fracture and incompleteness ("seam pulled loose," "chord so tense it trembled") with controlled lyric compression that serves the accumulative mode. The woman's minimal dialogue and the poet's spoken lines ("Morning is a torn net that still holds fish") carry poetic weight without feeling precious. Minor wobble in register during "cognitive smoothness" of philosophical articulation but recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagistic precision ("barbs still holding the violet of dawn," "clouded to the color of old longing") with information-dense lines that advance both external and thematic pressure. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("burnished hush of morning deepened") and occasional abstract phrasing ("harmonizing discord into a loom of almost") that slightly dulls immediacy, though the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of incompleteness as beauty transforms the familiar broken-object meditation through specific synthesis: the musical collaboration where discord becomes harmony, the spiral that gathers fragments without completing them. The three-path kite tail braiding into sunrise offers genuine surprise that feels earned, though the philosophical articulation occasionally tends toward expected literary territory.</comment>
