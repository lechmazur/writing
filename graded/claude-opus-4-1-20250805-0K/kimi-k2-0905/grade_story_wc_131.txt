<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical nature and three-year habitation create consistent motivation for his fragment-collecting mission, with internal contradiction between isolation and connection needs. The girl's characterization arrives late but her silent reading and tears at Lorca establish genuine emotional stakes. Minor deduction for the girl remaining more vessel than character, though her final "I see you" lands with earned emotional weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with fragments building density toward resonant reconfiguration when girl acknowledges Elias's presence. The closure ("I see you") transforms isolation into connection with clear emotional cost—Elias's years of hiding end. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (library, dawn, power outage).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crawl space architecture (joists, pipe chases, copper pipes) constrains Elias's movement and fragment placement effectively. "Sapphire hush" from emergency lights creates consistent atmosphere. Setting directly enables the story's mechanics—fragments hidden in specific infrastructure locations that Elias methodically retrieves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elias's private collecting to active sharing when he recognizes the girl "needed the voices." The tightening occurs when he chooses visibility over safety, with clear cost in abandoning three years of hiding. Agency drives the climax through his decision to reveal the fragments and himself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving human connection through crisis emerges organically from Elias's fragment-collecting and crystallizes in his recorded words: "Stories are lanterns...we cache them in darkness so others can find their way out." The ending reweights all prior collecting as preparation for this moment of transmission without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's infrastructure-focused attention ("mapping every joist and conduit") and sensory-rich fragment descriptions. Third-person limited maintains clean focalization throughout. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("constellation of voices warming the air") that slightly exceeds Elias's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("oxide surface flaking like dried blood"). Some overwriting in figurative density ("sapphire hush" appears 3x, "constellation of voices warming the air") and minor template cadence in fragment listing sequence. Information density high in opening establishes world efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller as secret library guardian offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic preservation. Specific detail (ferromagnetic tape fragments carrying sense memories) elevates familiar "keeper of lost things" trope. The inversion of visibility as sacrifice rather than achievement shows genuine risk-taking.</comment>
