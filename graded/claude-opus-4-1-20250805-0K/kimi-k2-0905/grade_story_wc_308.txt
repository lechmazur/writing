<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cael's internal journey from seeking to becoming shows genuine transformation, with the arrowhead merger representing costly acceptance of his role. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical states ("frequencies," "harmonics") rather than concrete embodied emotion, and the transformation happens through passive reception rather than active choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Cael's transformation from seeker to embodied echo, with cost visible in his physical stillness/rootedness. However, the accumulative lens suffers from repetitive imagery loops (bone towers singing, pulse wandering, endless echoes) that restate rather than deepen, and the transformation mechanism remains vague despite multiple attempts to explain it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon setting with bone towers creates vivid atmosphere and constrains Cael's final choice to stand still rather than move forward. Strong sensory work with towers humming at teeth-aching frequencies and dust whispering in wind, though some descriptions become ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding/becoming the wandering pulse is signaled early but escalation is minimal—Cael arrives, sings, and transforms without meaningful resistance or complication. The cost of becoming rooted/still reads more as fulfillment than sacrifice, lacking the tension needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding home through stillness rather than movement emerges organically from the imagery and Cael's transformation. However, the piece over-explains its meaning through repetitive philosophical statements about navigation and echoes rather than letting the concrete transformation speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mythic register maintains consistency but suffers from template cadence ("The harmonic stone skimmer..." repeated three times) and elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies. No dialogue to evaluate, and the prose lacks the rhythmic variation needed to support the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops damage momentum: "navigate without moving" concept restated five different ways, "pulse left wandering" recycled throughout, multiple variations of becoming echo/song. Template cadence with "The [noun] [verb]" openings and abstract mystical language ("frequencies," "resonance," "harmonics") that avoids concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of navigation through stillness and bone towers as ancient tuning forks shows originality. However, execution relies on mystical abstraction rather than grounded specificity, and the transformation feels predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>
