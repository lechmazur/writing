I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory transformations and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to translate silence crystallizes through embodied action (striking forks, mapping thermal emotions) with clear internal stakes. The transformation from acoustic scientist to thermal composer earns its arc through concrete choices under pressure. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional processing ("grief in slow violet waves") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's discovery that "the world had never been silent—only speaking in a dialect of heat and light" reweights the entire premise with visible cost (her capsizing becomes her masterpiece). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-taught thermal translations. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the when ("three months ago").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as active constraint—its frost melts in response to thermal music, becoming both canvas and instrument. Vivid sensory detail ("boots crunching on diamond dust," "frost-laced dome") serves the accumulative design. The setting transforms from sealed tomb to living artwork, directly enabling the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: single fork strike → multiple strikes → full thermal orchestra → melting dome → city-wide transformation. The cost is legible (Mara's capsizing trauma transforms into artistic purpose). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the stakes could intensify more sharply at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of loss into new language—silence as translation rather than absence. The child's treble-clef breath and the conservatory's thawing "in perfect fifths" avoid explicit moralizing while offering resonant answers. The capsizing-to-masterpiece turn reweights trauma without false redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("heat-mapping emotions scanner," "twelve forks ranging from whale-low to bat-high") that maintains consistency. Some register elevation in peak moments ("unshaken marvels," "liquid notes") slightly strains the POV's lexicon. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong propulsion with vivid imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing reduce immediacy: "silently expressive" appears twice, "the expression silently expressive" is redundant. Template cadence in the sequence "She struck...she struck another, then another" and some synonym churn around thermal/heat/warmth. Information density is high but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic science with thermal synesthesia after a sound-ending catastrophe is genuinely fresh. The specific detail of tuning forks becoming painting tools and the conservatory as thermal canvas elevates beyond template post-apocalyptic fiction. Risk-taking in the lyric-scientific hybrid mode heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
