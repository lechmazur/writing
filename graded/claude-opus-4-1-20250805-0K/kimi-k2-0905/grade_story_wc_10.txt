<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from fear through grief to wonder reads through embodied actions (pressing palm to glass, striking forks) rather than labels. The contradiction between her scientific training and emotional need to "translate" creates genuine tension that drives choices. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("grief in slow violet waves") and the final paragraph's slight drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with thermal music as the organizing principle, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes visible symphony. The cost is legible in Mara leaving her empty case and the conservatory's permanent transformation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the Great Hush context comes late) and the somewhat abstract nature of the final "seeds of thermal song."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as both setting and instrument, its frost and architecture constraining how Mara must work (through heat rather than sound). Sensory detail balances temperature, color, and implied sound brilliantly. The micro-setting of the tuning fork case drives the entire resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the world still speaks—escalates through Mara's systematic experimentation with the forks, each strike revealing more of the conservatory's hidden life. The cost manifests in the scanner's death and her walking away from her creation. The pressure builds well but could be sharper in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of translating sound to color/heat, avoiding direct statements about loss or communication. The final image of the child's treble-clef breath perfectly reweights the entire premise without moralizing. The recurring fork/temperature motif constrains choices throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("calibrating underwater microphones") married to lyrical perception ("diamond dust of shattered glass"). POV remains tightly controlled through Mara's sensory filter. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in emotional peaks ("unshaken marvels of music") that doesn't quite match her scientific lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with excellent rhythm variation and information density. Deductions for template cadence in the middle ("She struck...she struck another, then another") and some overwriting in figurative language ("seeds of thermal song waiting for spring"). The opening and closing lines are exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific instrumentation with emotional synesthesia creates a genuinely fresh angle on post-apocalyptic silence. The specific detail of tuning forks as emotional measuring devices feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the concept pays off without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
