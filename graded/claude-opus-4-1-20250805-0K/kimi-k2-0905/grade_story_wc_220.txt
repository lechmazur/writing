I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered sensory details and pattern shifts rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Scraps' transformation from corpse-finder to life-seeker drives clear choices with embodied urgency. The brother's discovery moment lands with earned relief, though Kite's emotional response remains somewhat muted at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the leaf's transformation from preserved relic to active key, with visible cost in the digging scene. The riddle-solving mechanism strains credibility slightly (wax pressing against cylinder creating coordinates), but the closure image of "closeness as the only distance worth traveling" successfully reweights the opening's emphasis on distance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wasteland setting constrains choices effectively—the buried subway car, the scrapyard's limited resources, the "soil turned to glass." The leaf's wax preservation and its "tinted revelations" create a micro-setting that drives the solution, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general searching to specific riddle-solving to physical excavation, with the brother's life as the dominant stake. The cost appears in the "bare hands" digging and Scraps' limp, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the riddle is solved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "translating distance into closeness" emerges organically through action rather than statement. The final image of the softening wax and orchard smoke replacing gunpowder offers resonant transformation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Scraps' scent-based navigation ("copper from iron," "metallic breath of cobalt"). Some prose reaches for poetry at the expense of clarity ("distance preserved yet closeness promised"), but voice remains controlled through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory detail, though several instances of abstract phrasing blur momentum ("wild hush that follows artillery," "teaching distance how to kneel"). Template cadence appears in the riddle sequence ("I am the... I am the...") but serves pattern. Minor loop in "tinted revelations" appearing three times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic riddle-solving (translating scent into coordinates) offers fresh specificity. The concept of preserved autumn in a post-war wasteland creates meaningful contrast, though the phonograph cylinder mechanism feels slightly convenient.</comment>
