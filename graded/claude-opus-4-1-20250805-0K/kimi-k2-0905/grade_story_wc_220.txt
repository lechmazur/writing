<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization through Scraps' sensory translation of abstract concepts and Kite's visceral desperation. The brother's emergence with "Name me and I am already home" earns the closure through prior setup of the riddle's logic. Minor deduction for the brother's underdeveloped presence despite being central to stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly with the riddle-solving providing causal spine while sensory details accumulate toward the transformation of "distance into closeness." The closure lands with visible cost (digging with bare hands, the leaf's transformation) and conceptual repricing as separation becomes "merely a groove waiting for the right nose." Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wax leaf constrains choice at the cylinder scene and charges the final image as it softens in sun. Sensory hierarchy through Scraps' nose ("copper from iron," "metallic breath of cobalt") creates lived-in specificity. The wasteland transforms from glass soil to "desert mallow" blooming in tank hulls, earning the orchard smoke revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The riddle creates genuine pressure requiring both Scraps' sensory translation and Kite's intuitive understanding to solve. Stakes tighten when the wax leaf must physically kiss the cylinder to unlock coordinates. Cost is visible but the brother's easy emergence slightly deflates the buildup's promise of difficulty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of reading grooves/riddles to collapse distance, avoiding abstraction. The final image of wind smelling "of orchard smoke instead of gunpowder" offers resonant answer without moralizing. "Every separation was merely a groove waiting for the right nose" reweights the entire wasteland as readable text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Scraps' synesthetic translations ("each pop of static smelled of ozone"). Prose modulates from lyrical density in revelation moments to spare clarity during action. The rhythmic control in "Scraps limping slightly ahead, no longer a bloodhound retired from finding bodies but a courier teaching distance how to kneel" demonstrates mastery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the wild hush that follows artillery and the deeper need to translate distance into closeness"). Some figurative density borders on excessive ("spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise") but serves the accumulative design. Clean propulsion despite complex syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synesthetic riddle-solving through scent is genuinely fresh, as is the phonograph cylinder containing coordinates rather than music. The post-war scrapyard setting with "towers of rusted drones" avoids generic wasteland. Transformation of familiar elements feels organic but doesn't quite reach the exceptional synthesis of 8.0+.</comment>
