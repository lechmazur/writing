<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellery's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions with the leaf blower, and his internal contradiction between hope and despair acts simultaneously in the tunnel scene. The moment of hearing Quinn's laughter shows credible irrationality rooted in loss. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where his wife also laughs, though the emotional cost of conducting for memory remains palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the tunnel's acoustic layering, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where absence gains "a shape echoing can carry." The hourglass-to-tunnel-to-home structure creates clear causality, and the cost (accepting loss while preserving memory) is visible. The orientation anchors establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as more than setting—it's an "echo-chamber" and "concrete throat" that enables the story's central action and charges the final haunting. Sensory detail focuses on sound (mechanical howl, layered chords, giggle bouncing wall to wall) fitting the POV's musical perception. The tunnel's transformation into an "organ pipe" constrains future possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring laughter/preserving memory) deepens from mechanical noise-making to accepting absence with new form. The escalation through "killed the throttle" to hearing the impossible sniffle creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible in Ellery sinking to his knees and the permanence of the tunnel's haunting, though the wife's laughter slightly softens the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of conducting absence into presence: "tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape." The hourglass/pull-cord/tunnel progression creates non-literal resonance without stated morals. The final image of the tunnel as "organ pipe" ready to sing reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac tone with controlled metaphorical density ("leaf-blower symphony conductor," "concrete throat," "glass marble dropped onto tile"). The perceptual signature focuses on sound and musical interpretation fitting Ellery's character. Slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("giving absence a shape echoing can carry") stays within bounds of grief's heightened state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts (short declaratives during action, longer accumulative sentences for memory). Information density is high—most lines advance both external action and internal state. Minor metaphor density in places ("heart macerated itself") but serves the heightened emotional register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The leaf-blower-as-instrument-of-grief premise transforms a mundane object through specific lived detail. The tunnel's evolution from echo chamber to permanent memorial offers a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the magical realist turn (actually hearing the laughter) heightens stakes while maintaining emotional truth about grief's irrationality.</comment>
