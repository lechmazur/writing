<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to preserve unspoken needs before thunder erases them is clear and drives the encoding action. The echo-self creates genuine internal conflict about whether preservation imprisons or liberates these needs. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of emotional states in places like "needs finally spoken" without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lyra releases the petals and the graffiti becomes a communal broadcast. Cost is visible in the dissolution of her echo-self and the transformation of preserved needs into shared experience. Orientation anchors arrive late (courtyard above clouds) but serve the ethereal atmosphere; the pattern-teaching justifies this.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds constrains Lyra's choices (she must work before thunder arrives) and the bolt plate functions as both tool and metaphor. The setting's liminal quality between lightning and thunder creates genuine urgency. The final broadcast to the city below extends the setting's vertical architecture meaningfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating needs before erasure—escalates through the echo's challenge and culminates in Lyra's choice to release rather than preserve. The time pressure between lightning and thunder creates urgency. The transformation from individual preservation to communal release shows clear cost in letting go of control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and release, with the graffiti moths manifesting suppressed longings as living creatures. The final image of the child seeing "I am lonely too" resonates without moralizing. The recurring motif of encoding/decoding needs gains depth through each iteration, particularly in the echo-mouth becoming a listening ear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with inventive compounds like "lightning-slag stylus" and "tinker-song wonder." POV control wavers slightly when describing the echo's perspective and the child's reaction below. The perceptual signature of experiencing vapor as musical notes is distinctive and sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "petals of every unspoken need she had ever collected lay flattened" show compression and purpose. However, abstract phrases like "needs finally spoken in the language of storm" and some repetitive constructions ("driftingly alert" appears four times) create mild drag. The prose achieves lyric density but occasionally sacrifices clarity for atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of encoding emotional needs as graffiti art that becomes bioluminescent moths is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of musical, visual, and tactile elements creates an original sensory palette. The transformation from individual artistic act to communal healing avoids predictable resolution.</comment>
