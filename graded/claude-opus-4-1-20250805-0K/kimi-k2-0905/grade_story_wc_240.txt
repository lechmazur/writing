<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation through personal loss (brother Luc) effectively drives her investigation and final choice. The dual Lucs create genuine internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where merging the brothers solves the emotional dilemma without fuller exploration of which version to choose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with topology folds building toward the merger resolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya accepts uncertainty about which Luc is "real," with visible emotional cost. Deduction for the slightly rushed explanation of the farm's true purpose mid-story and the merger mechanics feeling somewhat arbitrary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern's permeable topology functions as active setting that constrains choices and enables the final merger. Bioluminescent details are vivid and purposeful, with spores and light creating atmosphere. The spatial anomalies directly shape Maya's investigation tactics and final solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating a breach to confronting personal grief about Luc. The topology discovery meaningfully tightens options leading to the merger choice. Cost is visible in Maya's uncertainty about which Luc is real, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief and letting go emerges organically through the duplicate/echo concept. The final image of "light dispersing through relinquished grief" resonantly reweights the investigation as emotional journey. Slight deduction for Dr. Voss's explicit thematic statement about "revolutionizing closure."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Maya's spatial gift shaping how she perceives the cavern as "nested topographies." Clean POV control throughout with appropriate technical register for the intrusion specialist. Dialogue between the Lucs and Dr. Voss carries appropriate subtext about loss and acceptance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "sapphire-lit caps" and effective rhythm variation. Several instances of mild overwriting ("quiet wildfire racing her pulse" appears twice; "echo finally arriving, not as sound but as light") and occasional register elevation that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi detection with grief processing through the topology fold concept. The mushroom farm as a place to duplicate lost loved ones offers genuine novelty. Risk-taking in the ambiguous resolution about which Luc is "real" heightens emotional stakes.</comment>
