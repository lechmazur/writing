I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's spatial gift and personal grief over Luc create compelling motivation that drives every choice, particularly the final merger decision. The dual Lucs present genuine internal conflict between reclaiming the "original" and accepting both as valid, though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya accepts the impossibility of distinguishing original from copy, with visible cost in releasing her certainty about her brother's identity. The topology fold concept elegantly structures the causal chain from detection to understanding to merger, though the exact mechanics of the final "fusion" could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent cavern functions as more than setting—the permeable barriers and topology folds directly enable the plot's resolution and constrain Maya's choices. The laser pointer's path-tracing through impossible geometries creates vivid spatial choreography that charges the final merger sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from security breach to personal confrontation to existential choice about identity, with Maya's agency driving the merger decision despite uncertainty. The "no original, no copy—only choice" revelation effectively forecloses her initial goal while opening the harder path of acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of grief creating "permeable barriers" between loss and presence emerges organically through the farm's function, culminating in the powerful final image of echo becoming light. The story resists simple resolution, leaving ambiguity about whether the merged Luc is brother or compassionate forgery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya's spatially-gifted perception creates a distinct focalization that tracks topology and movement with precision, while her emotional register modulates believably from professional detection to personal recognition. The prose maintains consistent scientific-poetic register throughout, though occasional phrases like "quiet wildfire" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "sapphire-lit caps" and effective rhythm variation, but some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("quiet wildfire racing her pulse") and repetition of "permeable barriers" slightly dulls momentum. The final sentence, while thematically resonant, stretches syntactically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The topology fold concept offers a fresh take on dimensional anomalies, and the mushroom farm as grief-resolution technology presents genuine originality. The specific synthesis of bioluminescence, spatial detection, and identity ambiguity creates something memorable, though the "duplicate people for closure" concept edges toward familiar sci-fi territory.</comment>
