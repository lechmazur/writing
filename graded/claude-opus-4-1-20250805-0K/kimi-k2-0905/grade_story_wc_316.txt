<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act throughout (Mara's numbness vs. emerging feeling, Zero's detachment vs. tears). The final synthesis choice is fully earned through the ritual's causality. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("ego death," "emotional numbness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: two beings dissolve into one synthesis parent, with visible cost (loss of individual selves). The custody ritual drives causality tightly through complementary confession rounds. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the transformative merger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo and glowing brain constrain the ritual space effectively. The rewriting Pacific and time-shifts create pressure. Setting dissolves purposefully after resolution. Minor deduction for some abstract world-building ("rewritten histories") that doesn't fully anchor spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from custody battle to existential merger, with each confession round raising emotional cost. The "dissolve into narrative fog" threat creates real pressure. Zero's faltering at naming fear becomes the pivot. Cost is visible in the lost individual selves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox "only by holding the opposite do we become real." The brain's vivification through shared wounds creates resonance without stating morals. The final synthesis and child's impossible word offer non-literal answers to identity/unity questions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive mythic register with controlled compression ("history rewrote itself for the seventh time"). Some excellent moments ("footprints already fading where history might choose"). Deduction for occasional elevated diction that strains ("vivifying every deadened nerve") and some filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("like light through twin prisms"). Several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy ("emotional numbness," "narrative fog," "paradoxical creed"). Some repetitive "had [verb]" constructions. Information density is good but uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone identity, custody battle, and reality-rewriting creates genuine originality. The complementary opposites becoming one parent is earned and non-obvious. The floating dojo and brain-in-jar avoid cliché through specific integration. Risk-taking with the merger resolution heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
