I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered paradoxes and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, with the brain-in-jar ritual accumulating meaning toward synthesis.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's progression from ego-death numbness to feeling's return is earned through the ritual's concrete beats, with contradictory impulses (attachment/detachment) acting simultaneously. The synthesis resolution where two become one is motivated by prior setup. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "complementary opposites" that borders on conceptual speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the synthesis of Mara/Zero into one parent, with visible cost (dissolution of individual selves). The accumulative structure coheres around the brain-ritual that builds toward unity. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, Pacific, custody battle) establish by ~100 words. Deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "rewriting history" mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo and brain-in-jar constrain the ritual's choices effectively, with the obsidian blade creating spatial tension. "History rewrites itself" provides temporal pressure. Environment directly shapes the resolution when the dojo dissolves after purpose completion. Minor deduction for some generic Eastern monastery trappings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The custody ritual creates clear stakes with escalating emotional vivification through each round. Cost is legible when both selves dissolve into synthesis. The reversal when Mara takes Zero's hand instead of competing provides meaningful deepening. Slight deduction as the ritual's rules could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox "only by holding the opposite do we become real," paid off in the synthesis resolution. The brain's transformation from discarded neural map to vivifying agent creates resonant symbolism. The child's wordless response and fading footprints offer non-literal answers to identity questions without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled psychic distance, especially in "tasting color" and sensing "the weight of absolute silence." Voice maintains consistency through the mystical register. Some filter-verb clustering ("She felt," "She saw") in middle sections prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of vivid imagery ("brain dissolved into motes"). However, several paraphrase loops appear ("History crashed over them like a wave, erasing wars, inventing dynasties" followed by redundant rewrite descriptions). Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions. Abstract phrasing around "complementary opposites" and "synthesis" dulls some beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The clone-split-by-gender concept offers fresh inflection on identity themes. The custody battle as metaphysical ritual rather than legal proceeding shows originality. Specific details like "DUPLICATE" label and the brain pulsing colors elevate beyond template mysticism, though some Eastern dojo elements feel familiar.</comment>
