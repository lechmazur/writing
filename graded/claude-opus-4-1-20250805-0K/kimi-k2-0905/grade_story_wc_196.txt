<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan's internal journey from waiting for validation to actively creating meaning shows clear motivation with embodied details like "heart stuttered" and the physical act of brushing dust. The transformation from passive archivist to active meaning-maker is earned through concrete micro-choices, though some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("tactfully hopeful").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Rowan's shift from passive waiting to active archival intervention, with visible cost in her acknowledgment that "the past had not been waste." The accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns literally accumulate into meaning, culminating in her transformative act of placing the button in Marcus's file.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The file room functions as both physical constraint and emotional crucible, with sensory details like "mildew and closingtime" and "fluorescent tubes" grounding the space. The dust patterns become micro-setting that constrains choice when Rowan must decide how to read them, though some descriptions lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the past wasn't waste—escalates from passive waiting through discovery to active intervention. The button's discovery forces Rowan to choose between cataloguing protocol and creating potential connection, with the cost visible in her deliberate rule-breaking ("Unknown, but breathing").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending's image of Rowan catching snow while whispering "Marcus" brilliantly reweights the opening's isolation into connection-making. The theme of small kindnesses magnifying emerges through concrete acts rather than statement, particularly in the parallel between the secretary's "You're safe now" and Rowan's own act of preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on archival details and accumulation metaphors. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("sunrise over a battlefield") but the perceptual signature of reading dust like "sailors read wind" creates distinctive focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "paper yield like old scab" and "folders that coughed dust" show precise imagery, but several passages contain loops ("small kindness" appears 4 times) and abstract constructions ("archives are futures disguised as pasts"). The prose occasionally strains for profundity at the expense of clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of reading accumulated dust patterns as script offers genuine originality, transforming the mundane into the mystical through specific detail. The synthesis of foster care trauma with archival preservation creates fresh emotional territory, though some metaphors feel overworked.</comment>
