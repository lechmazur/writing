<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan's internal conflict between staying for the stipend versus seeking validation through small kindnesses creates genuine tension, with her discovery and placement of the button revealing character through micro-choices. The embodied details (finger tracing "like old scab," heart stuttering) avoid stock phrasing, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("archives are futures disguised as pasts").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Rowan discovering the button, reading dust patterns as histories, then placing it in Marcus's file—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the archive from static repository to active hope. Cost is felt through the "missing stair" of Marcus's incomplete record and Rowan's own foster care trauma, though the final transformation feels slightly rushed for the weight it claims.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The file room's mildew and dust become active constraints as Rowan reads patterns "like sailors read wind," with the button and dust serving as micro-settings that shape her choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from discovery behind drawer to placement in Marcus's file, and sensory details filter through her archivist's attention to preservation and decay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal validation-seeking to potential reunion of button with Marcus, with the dominant stake (proving past wasn't waste) tightening when Rowan commits the bureaucratic transgression of adding undocumented evidence. The cost—risking her position to create possibility—is implied rather than dramatized, weakening the final pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the dust patterns revealing foster care histories and the button as uncatalogued hope, with the ending's snow accumulation reframing "small kindnesses" from abstract concept to physical accumulation. The story resists tidy resolution by leaving Marcus's fate unknown while charging the archive with future possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent archival precision ("Box 1987-C," "Uncatalogued Exhibit A") while modulating into lyric registers during dust-reading without losing POV coherence. Some passages strain toward purple prose ("unfurl across its dents like sunrise over a battlefield") but recover through concrete action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple functions, but several metaphoric reaches strain coherence ("archives are futures disguised as pasts," "history had just been rerouted"). Template cadence appears in the dust-reading sequence ("First came...Next...Then") though it creates purposeful accumulation. Minor loop in "small kindness" repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The conceit of reading dust patterns as compressed histories offers fresh specificity, and linking a WWII button to a 1987 foster child through bureaucratic transgression avoids expected resolution. The transformation from passive archivist to active hope-creator feels earned through accumulated details rather than convenient epiphany.</comment>
