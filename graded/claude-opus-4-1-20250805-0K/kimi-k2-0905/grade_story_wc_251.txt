I'll evaluate this literary story according to the rigorous standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's ability to hear unspoken words drives concrete choices throughout, particularly her recognition of Ellis's handwriting and her response to the magnetic grotto. The collective cast who arrive barefoot carrying saplings shows earned transformation through specific dramatized moments. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in collective motivation ("forests of second thoughts") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught repetition ("forests of second thoughts," magnetic grotto) that pays off in the final image of pawns stepping off boards. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the window displays and collective ritual, with visible cost in characters' confessions. Orientation anchors (library, town, after curfew) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library and magnetic grotto function as micro-settings that constrain choices—the grotto guides Mara's compass and becomes the ritual's center. Synchronized window displays create spatial choreography that tracks cleanly. The iron trees trembling toward living saplings provides tactile, lived-in detail that charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on rebellion against fixed games/rules, signaled early through chess metaphors and Ellis's refusal to sacrifice pieces. The window display sequence deepens pressure through accumulation rather than reversal. Cost manifests in characters' confessions of small rebellions, though the immediate price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess pieces' desires and the "unspoken gambit: what if losing is the only way the game learns?" The final image of pawns stepping off boards into sapling shadows offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Each confession reveals thematic resonance through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in how Mara hears "unspoken words the way other people heard wind." Lyric compression serves the accumulative design, with purposeful elision taught early. Minor dialogue ("I knew you'd hear it") carries subtext effectively, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in sequences like "pawns advancing backward, knights refusing leaps, kings kneeling." Some elevated diction ("humble rebellion," "amplified quiet") fits the lyric mode. Occasional abstract phrasing ("forests of second thoughts") and light repetition of "humble rebellion" prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of chess pieces rebelling against their prescribed moves offers fresh transformation of familiar material. Risk-taking in the lyric/accumulative structure and the collective ritual format heightens stakes. The magnetic grotto as mystical object that guides rebellion shows bold specificity that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
