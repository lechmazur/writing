<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's ability to hear unspoken words from chess pieces creates a distinctive interiority that drives her rebellion, and Ellis's barefoot arrival with dripping sapling shows embodied specificity. The collective characters' confessions reveal layered motivations through concrete actions (stacking coins, leaving bulbs loose). Minor deduction for some characters remaining more symbolic than individuated, particularly the anonymous followers who arrive after Ellis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the town's synchronized rebellion takes root through window displays and shared confessions, with visible cost in characters risking curfew and social order. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from individual acts to collective transformation. Slight deduction for the magical realism elements (pieces moving on their own) arriving late without sufficient grounding earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt library "breathing the cold hush where past meets prophecy" establishes atmosphere immediately, and the magnetic grotto's iron trees create a micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Window displays across town become spatial choreography that shapes the rebellion. The specificity of "amplified quiet" as the hour after curfew when streetlights dim grounds the fantastical in concrete detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mara's solitary chess coaching to orchestrating town-wide rebellion, with meaningful deepening when participants confess their small acts of resistance. The cost manifests in characters risking discovery after curfew and Ellis quitting the team "rather than sacrifice another piece." The window displays crystallize as both method and metaphor for the rebellion's spread.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor of fixed games versus chosen moves, with the magnetic grotto's iron trees reaching toward real saplings embodying artificial rules seeking organic growth. The final image of pawns stepping off boards into sapling shadows offers resonant answer without stating moral. Each confession reveals how small rebellions plant "forests of second thoughts" in systems.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("coat collar soaked in starlight") and controlled metaphorical language that serves the accumulative mode. Perceptual signature evident in how Mara experiences sound as tactile ("voice barely dust on the air"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established voice ("telegraph of hearts ready to sprout").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (atmospheric, thematic, and narrative simultaneously). Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression throughout. Deduction for occasional overwriting in metaphorical density ("cobalt library...breathing the cold hush where past meets prophecy") and minor template patterns in the confession sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of chess pieces having consciousness and desires transforms a familiar game into fresh territory for exploring agency and rebellion. The synchronized window displays as method of quiet revolution shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the magical realist elements and collective action structure heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
