I'll evaluate this literary story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered images and somatic markers toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator commits to "living as the trees live."

<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystalizes through embodied grief ("mapping [plants] against hollow places in my body") and contradictory impulses between fleeing and dissecting memory for mercy. The final choice to release the photograph while pressing Nadia's image into resin shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the narrator chooses continuation "as the trees live, damaged yet upright" with clear cost ("grief ends its dictatorship"). The accumulative lens holds as somatic markers build toward the covenant, though early orientation could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables choices—the cliff's danger, the dragon's-blood pine's resin preserving memory, the abandoned lighthouse marking absence. The arboretum functions as both literal space and emotional architecture where "roots grip stone like desperate fingers."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from carrying the photograph to the "freeze" exercise to releasing it while preserving Nadia's image in resin. The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—deepens through somatic markers that "glow" as small lighthouses, with cost visible in tearing paper and salt tears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the image pattern of lighthouses/keepers—from the abandoned structure to somatic markers as "small lighthouses after the last lighthouse keeper." The final covenant reweights all prior material without stating a moral: "grief is not a landmine to avoid; it is a coastline to learn by heart."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through grief's lens—"the drone as a distant heron, the blast as a red chrysanthemum." Voice modulates expertly from clinical ("somatic markers") to lyrical ("pearl of stillness") to match emotional intensity without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Tonight the wind combs the cliff with a sound like tearing paper" (atmosphere + foreshadowing + emotional state). Some elevated diction ("arithmetic of continuation") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The somatic mapping technique—learning plant names to press against body scars when "grief spikes"—offers genuine originality. The wedding drone strike survivor processing trauma through botanical anchoring transforms familiar grief narrative through specific, lived detail.</comment>
