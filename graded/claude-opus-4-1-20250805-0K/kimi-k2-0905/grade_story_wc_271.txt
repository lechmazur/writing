I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the pattern of somatic mapping, ritual repetition, and the final crystallization through physical anchoring.

<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-driven ritual of somatic mapping shows exceptional embodied emotion ("I learned the names by mapping them against the hollow places in my body"). The final choice to release the photograph while anchoring Nadia's image in resin demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the covenant "I will live as the trees live" with clear cost ("carrying nothing but the somatic map"). The accumulative pattern of botanical anchoring pays off when "the air tastes not of metal but of possible mornings," though the orientation wavers slightly with the drone strike reveal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum functions as active setting—trees that "kept their own watch," branches that "brush my shoulder, leaving a smear of resin." The dragon's-blood pine becomes essential to closure when it preserves Nadia's image, making environment inseparable from the protagonist's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure as the protagonist moves from viewing grief as "a clerical error" to "a coastline to learn by heart." The ritual intensifies from passive carrying to active release, with the photograph's destruction marking irreversible change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the pearl metaphor—"her joy remains intact, a pearl of stillness inside the wreckage"—which transforms into "keeping a pearl of stillness at the core." The story resists easy resolution while offering genuine transformation through "the arithmetic of continuation."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through botanical precision ("mallee eucalyptus, dragon's-blood pine") and metaphorical density ("waves detonate against basalt"). The perceptual signature of mapping grief onto landscape creates a unique focalization, though occasional abstraction ("diligence begins") slightly weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong poetic density with images like "the sky has burned down to ember" and purposeful rhythm variation. However, abstract phrases like "arithmetic of continuation" and "dictatorship/diligence" pairing feel slightly overwrought, introducing mild register drift in the final movement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The somatic mapping concept—using botanical names as grief anchors—offers remarkable originality. The specific detail of the wedding drone strike and the transformation of celebration into trauma ("Nadia's hand still reaching upward, not for help but for the bouquet") creates unforgettable specificity.</comment>
