I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through sensory accumulation, mathematical metaphors, and pattern recognition rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from interrogation survivor to mathematical penitent is viscerally embodied through proprioceptive enhancement and UV perception. The mathematics of mercy motivation drives genuine micro-choices (placing the mask strap, reading equations in bark), though the character remains somewhat abstracted behind concept-heavy language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forest's "forgetting" and the mask becoming "trash" reweight the entire penance journey as an asymptotic approach to forgiveness. The orientation (post-interrogation, UV forest, enhanced body) anchors clearly by ~120 words. However, the mathematical abstractions occasionally obscure the visceral cost that should charge the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The UV forest functions brilliantly as both setting and psychological landscape—leaves as "invisible fire," bark holding equations, the forest administering "communion in millijoules." The proprioceptive enhancement makes the body itself a micro-setting that constrains every movement with remembered trauma.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on discovering mercy's mathematics while the body rebels with trauma responses. The three equations create meaningful deepening, and placing the mask strap represents genuine renunciation. However, the abstract mathematical framing occasionally distances us from feeling the full weight of the protagonist's suffering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mathematical mercy theme emerges organically through embodied discovery—equations appearing in heartbeats, bark, and retinas. The ending's "most honest miracle" of the mask becoming trash offers profound thematic resonance without moralizing, suggesting forgiveness as mundane rather than transcendent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges scientific precision ("proprioceptively enhanced," "asymptotic") with visceral poetry ("slug of metal that had grown into my skin"). The perceptual signature—seeing UV wavelengths as moral frequencies—is highly original and consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("pewter mask strap bit into soft flesh," "ultraviolet sap print its bruise-colored fingerprints") with excellent rhythm variation. Some abstract passages ("mathematics of mercy," "asymptotic approaching zero suffering") risk opacity, and occasional conceptual density slows momentum in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of enhanced interrogation trauma with mathematical theology and synaesthetic perception. The UV penance as wavelength of guilt broadcast into spine, and mercy as mathematical limit rather than divine gift, creates genuinely fresh territory. Risk-taking with abstract concepts mostly succeeds.</comment>
