<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with proprioceptive enhancement creating visceral character experience ("every twig's snap echoed inside my joints"). The mathematical framing of mercy provides consistent motivation through concrete equations rather than abstractions. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("ultraviolet penance required no priest") that briefly distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward charged poise at closure—the protagonist walks away with "numbers scribbled along my arms" and the forest's forgetting as partial mercy. Cost is legible through physical pain and the asymptotic nature of forgiveness ("forever approaching zero suffering yet never touching it"). Orientation anchors who/what clearly but "where" remains deliberately vague, serving the surreal tone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and antagonist, with leaves that "drip" light and trees whose sap prints "bruise-colored fingerprints." Sensory hierarchy reflects the altered perception convincingly. The pewter strap's transformation from torture device to offering ground shows environment participating in the mercy equation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on discovering "the mathematics of mercy" through embodied pain, with escalation through three equations that deepen understanding. The proprioceptive spikes force confrontation with trauma memories, narrowing the path to either acceptance or madness. Final acceptance of approximation ("one unit of mercy extracted from an infinite series") shows earned resignation with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mathematical metaphor without explicit moralizing—mercy as asymptote is discovered through experience, not declared. The forest's final forgetting ("had already forgotten me") offers resonant answer to the central question. Strong avoidance of tidy resolution; the protagonist gains only incremental progress toward an impossible absolute.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges scientific precision with visceral sensation ("wavelength of guilt broadcast straight into the spine"). Perceptual signature consistent throughout with mathematical framing of emotional experience. Rhythm control excellent, particularly in the equation reveals that punctuate the wandering with moments of crystallized understanding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("cathedral of invisible fire") and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("slug of metal that had grown into my skin like a wedding ring made of scars") and occasional register drift into academic exposition. Information density high but occasionally tips into ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mathematical framing of trauma recovery offers genuine originality—equations for mercy discovered through proprioceptive enhancement is conceptually fresh. Risk-taking in the surreal register and abstract resolution pays off through specificity of sensation. The asymptotic nature of forgiveness resists easy closure while remaining emotionally true.</comment>
