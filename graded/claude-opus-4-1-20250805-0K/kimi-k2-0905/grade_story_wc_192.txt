<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's internal contradiction between teaching death while learning to live creates genuine complexity, with her suffocation practice embodying this tension. The boy's characterization as suffocating under excessive love provides a fresh angle on parental pressure. Deducted for some abstract emotional labeling ("loaded emptiness," "terrible sunrise") and the boy's relatively thin presence compared to the keeper's rich interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ritual teaching building to a resonant reconfiguration where the boy's dissolution becomes transformative breath. The closure lands with felt cost as the keeper receives "memory of his first real breath, taken in death." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (sanctuary's nature emerges gradually) and some causality softness in how the ritual mechanics actually work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary effectively constrains the scene, with its "collapsed roof like frozen tears" and "scorched circle" grounding the ritual space. The doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting that enables the threshold crossing. Deducted for some abstract descriptors ("loaded emptiness") and missed opportunities to use physical sanctuary details to shape specific ritual mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on the boy learning to "die properly" to find peace, with the keeper's parallel journey providing secondary tension. The ritual's progression from sharing pain to dissolution provides adequate escalation. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance—the boy accepts the process too readily, and the transformation feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence around suffocation as both death and rebirth, with the paradox "suffocating to breathe" crystallizing in the final transformation. The keeper's role as bridge between worlds while burning her own bridges adds layered irony. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic statement "Sometimes we must learn to die properly before we can live again."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with evocative perceptual signature ("frozen tears," "whisper of a boy"). The voice maintains gothic atmosphere while avoiding purple prose excess. Deducted for occasional register elevation that strains against intimate POV ("terrible sunrise," "resonant revelation") and some repetitive constructions in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong opening and closing lines, though middle sections contain repetitive structures ("She [verb]" patterns). Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("frozen tears," "terrible sunrise") without clear pattern-teaching. The phrase "loaded emptiness" appears multiple times without evolution. Information density is adequate but could be tighter in the ritual explanation passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a shadow keeper teaching the dead to breathe through shared suffocation offers genuine originality. The specific detail of the boy dying from being "loved too much" transforms a familiar ghost story into something fresher. Slight deduction for relying on some gothic sanctuary tropes without full transformation.</comment>
