<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's internal contradiction between teaching death while learning to live creates genuine complexity, with her scars physically linking to the boy's in a way that transforms both. The boy's suffocation under "being loved too much" offers fresh psychological specificity. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("teaching herself to suffocate properly") but the embodied scar-linking and final breath exchange earn strong marks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through ritual repetition toward the boy's dissolution and keeper's revelation about "suffocating to breathe." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as she receives "his first real breath, taken in death" that teaches her breathing is "not an ending but a beginning." Orientation anchors clearly (shadow keeper, sanctuary, three months). Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation in places.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary with its "collapsed roof like frozen tears" and "scorched circle" creates atmospheric pressure that shapes the ritual space. The doorknocker ring functions as tactile threshold object. The sanctuary's breathing walls mirror character states effectively. Setting constrains choice through the ritual circle but could more actively shape specific tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on teaching the dead to let go through shared suffocation, with one meaningful deepening as keeper reveals her parallel experience. The boy's dissolution represents genuine transformation with visible cost. Escalation occurs through the scar-linking that creates "a web of light" connecting their suffering. Some abstraction in how the teaching actually works limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "suffocating to breathe" and learning to "die properly before we can live again," avoiding direct moralizing. The final gift of breath reweights the entire suffocation motif. Subtext operates well through the keeper's admission of burning bridges. Minor deduction for one instance of theme-speak ("Sometimes we must learn to die properly").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled repetition ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness") that builds texture. Perceptual signature shows in how she experiences the boy's presence as "pressure against her lungs." Dialogue carries subtext about shared suffering. Some repetitive phrasing ("loaded emptiness" appears twice identically) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "memories burned like embers" and "frozen tears." Information density generally strong with most lines advancing multiple purposes. Deductions for template cadence in middle section ("She [verb], [verb]ing" pattern) and two paraphrase loops about suffocating/breathing. Final image of practicing suffocation "again" trails off incomplete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of ghosts who must learn to breathe in order to die offers fresh angle on liminal space stories. Specific detail of suffocating from "being loved too much" transforms familiar ghost-keeper trope. The shadow keeper as someone learning from those she guides inverts expected dynamics. Some familiar elements (sanctuary, threshold imagery) prevent exceptional scoring.</comment>
