<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's warmly inquisitive nature drives concrete micro-choices throughout (tracing symbols, arranging pages, trading thimble for ash) with embodied emotion in "goggles warm against her cheeks." The final choice to remain below "watering the future" shows credible transformation from servant to cultivator with visible cost of abandoning her position. Minor deduction for some filter-verb reliance ("she felt the goggles translate") in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through cipher symbols, musical notation, and seed planting that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms from "ascending" to "expanding, roots and branches alike." The captain's leap recontextualizes from suicide to seed-scattering, creating clear before/after with felt cost. Orientation anchors (elevator, tenth floor, observatory) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire functions as micro-setting constraining movement (elevator cage, maintenance ladders) while the sub-basement hothouse creates vivid contrast "humid air that smelled of apricots." Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's servant-eye priorities (polishing, folding, methodical care). The apricot tree and its seed directly enable the final choice, elevating setting beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the captain's death/discovering hidden joy) escalates through accumulative revelations: goggles project cipher → diary opens → map reveals hothouse → seed enables future cultivation. Each discovery narrows Lira's options from reporting to the housekeeper toward choosing transformation. Cost manifests in abandoning her elevated servant position for underground cultivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the apricot tree image "blooming in defiance of perpetual winter" and the captain's method of smuggling "delight into sorrow's fortress." The ending reweights ascension as false progress versus expansion as true growth without stating this moral. Minor moments (duke's son's major chord, stoker's laugh) accumulate as "bulbs" of joy Lira stores, creating resonant subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct voice maintains servant's methodical perception ("same methodical care she once used to fold the duke's cravats") with selective attention to polish, arrangement, and cultivation. Consistent free indirect style and psychic distance. Some filter-verb clustering ("felt the world tint amber," "felt the goggles warm") slightly dulls immediacy in transition moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with varied syntax and purposeful compression ("frost-lensed heartbeat," "engine-oil and bergamot"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb stack in middle section ("felt," "noticed," "heard") and one paraphrase loop around the diary's water-stain/musical staff that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of servant's elevation narrative with inverted vertical metaphor (descending to grow rather than ascending to serve). The captain's "fatal wager with gravity" transforming into seed dispersal shows non-obvious reframing. Risk-taking with dense symbolic layering (goggles/vision, elevator/levels, tree/roots) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
