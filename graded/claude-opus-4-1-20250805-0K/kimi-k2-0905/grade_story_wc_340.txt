<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity drives consistent agency through discovery and choice, with embodied details like "goggles warm against her cheeks." The final transformation from "servant no longer ascending but expanding" lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("affectionately detached") rather than fully embodied states in the hothouse scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught symbols, musical notation, and seed-planting that reweight into expansion metaphor. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's choice to remain below "watering the future," with visible cost of abandoning her position. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2; causality holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich sensory palette ("frost-lensed heartbeat," "engine-oil and bergamot") with setting constraining movement through elevator/spire architecture. The hothouse's humid contrast to frozen spire charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across ten floors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about captain's death through diary discovery to choosing the hothouse over servitude. The dominant stake—finding joy beneath sorrow—tightens when Lira must forfeit her ascending position. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: apricot tree "blooming in defiance," joy "smuggled into sorrow's fortress." The final image of "roots and branches alike" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through goggles' translation and the captain's encrypted methods.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Lira's "methodical care" lens and lyrical compression ("frost-lensed heartbeat"). Voice maintains consistency through emotional intensification. Minor dialogue but what exists ("major chord, tentative as sunrise") carries subtext effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Deductions for overlength sentences that occasionally blur focus ("she felt the goggles translate..." runs 40+ words) and some abstract phrasing ("affectionately detached") that could be more concrete. Information density high but momentum occasionally stalls in description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of servant's perspective with encrypted botanical resistance. The goggles-as-cipher device and hothouse-beneath-ice feel earned rather than convenient. Specific details like "water-stain shape of a laughing mouth" forming musical notation show genuine ingenuity.</comment>
