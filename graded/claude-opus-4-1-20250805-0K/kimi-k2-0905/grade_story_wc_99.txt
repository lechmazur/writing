<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's need to resolve unspoken apologies drives consistent internal pressure, with embodied grief ("hollow beneath my ribs") and concrete micro-choices through the lace instructions. Kaede's characterization through slowness and silence effectively mirrors his own severance trauma. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("cerulean regret") rather than pure embodiment in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the compass ritual transforms regret into understanding, with visible cost in the mother's dock image and the permanent teal marking. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through the three lace instructions toward final release. Orientation anchors (islet, Kaede, compass) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The compass, lace, and bonsai pine constrain choices and charge the final image, particularly when the pine absorbs the apology's color. Sensory detail ("wet cedar and distant diesel") filters through the narrator's maritime past. The teal needles keeping "the hue I would recognize in every future twilight" directly links setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving unspoken apologies) established early and tightens through three lace instructions that progressively transform the compass's glow. Each instruction forces deeper engagement with regret, culminating in the breath diffusion that costs the narrator their held grief. The mother's dock image provides concrete emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The final image of pruning as apology ("cutting to let light in") offers a resonant non-literal answer to forgiveness without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the compass color, lace pattern, and bonsai absorption. The teal as "the moment the sea decides to forgive the sky" avoids abstraction through specific imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through maritime metaphors ("tide hissed," "ghost ship") and measured rhythm matching Kaede's slowness. Clean POV control with selective perception of color and texture. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Kaede's final gesture for silence preserving the pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("leaf allowed to fall in its own minute"), though occasional abstract phrases ("cerulean regret," "rhythmically placid") create mild register drift. Some template cadence in the instruction sequence but justified by ritual pattern. Information density high with most lines serving multiple functions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lace-as-instruction-manual concept offers a fresh angle on memory and forgiveness rituals. Specific synthesis of bonsai artistry with emotional pruning creates non-obvious resonance. Some reliance on color-of-emotion metaphor feels familiar, preventing higher score.</comment>
