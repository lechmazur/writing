<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tutor's internal conflict between regret and return is embodied through concrete actions (trimming the bonsai, reading the lace, rowing back), with his slow-spoken nature constraining how he processes and acts. The final choice to return and teach again carries visible cost through the "banner of surrender" and the acceptance of his pruned memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lace pattern gradually revealing itself as both map and apology, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tutor's return reframes the severance as "a long pruning." The closure lands with felt cost as he crosses the threshold wearing the faded blue lace, though the final incomplete sentence slightly weakens the ending's precision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The islet, compass, and lace function as micro-settings that constrain choices—the compass points to the lace pattern rather than north, the tree must "grow toward what points," and the greenhouse doorway becomes a threshold moment. While vivid, the mainland academy remains somewhat generic compared to the specificity of the islet elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the tutor can return and speak his apology—tightens through the lace's transformation from unreadable pattern to map to worn banner. The escalation follows the textural lens as details accumulate (rose, vacancy, rose) until the cerulean color fixes and enables his return, though the ghost students' appearance feels slightly disconnected from the main pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of apology-as-pruning emerges organically through the bonsai metaphor, with the severance reframed as forcing "memory into compact rings that could survive any storm." The lace pattern becomes instructions for forgiveness without stating a moral, and the incomplete final sentence suggests ongoing process rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a lyric, contemplative register appropriate to the tutor's slow-spoken nature, with syntax that mirrors his deliberate thought ("syllables drifting like fog"). The incomplete final sentence and consistent use of indirect dialogue ("I kept space for your return") reinforce character, though some passages drift toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density in most passages, but several instances of elevated register ("tides of remembrance," "rhythmically placid time") create slight distance from the POV's voice. The prose achieves lyric compression effectively, though phrases like "gunwale" and "diacritics" feel unnecessarily precise for this contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of bonsai cultivation with emotional pruning offers a fresh angle on apology and return, with the lace-as-map providing unexpected specificity. The incomplete ending and the concept of severance as necessary compression show risk-taking, though the ghost ship element feels somewhat ornamental to the core metaphor.</comment>
