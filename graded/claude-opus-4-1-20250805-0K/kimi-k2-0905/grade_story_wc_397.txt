<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from death tourist to volunteer dispatcher shows earned change through witnessed trauma and the boy's arrival. The "fold in patience" manifests in concrete micro-choices (not recording words, giving away the parasol). However, internal contradiction feels underdeveloped in scene—her shift happens too smoothly without sufficient embodied struggle at the crucial boarding moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's choice to stay and help transforms into a lifelong vocation, with the parasol tip becoming a permanent marker of patience. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks (the mercy ship learning "hesitation"). Cost appears in her carrying "the note away inside the fold" and the boy's frostbitten trauma, though the immediate price of her choice could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina creates genuine pressure through grinding floes and capsizing trawlers. Sensory details like "plates of sea that groaned under their own weight" and the parasol tip's "chime thinner than moonlight" anchor the ethereal premise. The ice functions as both setting and agent, constraining movement and threatening erasure, particularly charging the final image of "lace learning the shape of weather."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's confrontation with sanctioned death—deepens through the boy's arrival and their shared recognition at the gangway. The parasol tap that produces his mother's humming note creates a meaningful turn. However, escalation plateaus after this moment; the tea-serving sequence diffuses rather than tightens pressure, and her final choice lacks a sharp trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "the fold in patience"—not delay but "a hinge" allowing reality to swing. The parasol tip's evolution from heirloom to compass to permanent ice marker embodies how patience becomes "another word for staying usable." The ending's cyclical structure with a new volunteer "listening" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "grips reality loosely" and "windborne solace." The perceptual signature shows in selective details (the chip worried since childhood, the thermos's crossed-oar emblem). However, some passages drift into elevated register ("private longitude," "portable roofs against endings") that strain against the intimate POV established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong moments like "a chime thinner than moonlight, a sound that tasted of salt and lullabies" show controlled synesthesia. But template cadence appears in the elder sequence ("Each elder drank, then spoke"), and abstract phrases like "the exact sound of approaching endings" lack concrete anchoring. The prose occasionally reaches for profundity at the expense of clarity, particularly in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of euthanasia tourism transformed into disaster relief work offers fresh moral territory. The parasol tip's journey from personal talisman to shared artifact to permanent installation shows inventive use of object-as-character. The "fold in patience" metaphor sustains originality throughout, though some phrasing ("grips reality loosely") feels workshopped rather than organic.</comment>
