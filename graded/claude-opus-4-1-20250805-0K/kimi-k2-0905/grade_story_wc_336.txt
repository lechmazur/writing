<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to preserve wonder is embodied through concrete actions (building the loom, capturing color droplets) with internal complexity shown in his understanding that hoarding versus sharing creates different costs. The transformation from pruner to wanderer is earned through his realized mistake and subsequent choice to release the wonder. Minor deduction for some abstraction around "wonder's pigment" that occasionally leans conceptual over embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Arin's understanding shifts from preservation-as-containment to preservation-as-distribution, with visible cost in the loom's collapse and his aging. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through the weaving ritual to the release. Orientation anchors (pruner, waterfall, parapet) establish by ~100 words. The final image of the sapling with roots "half in soil, half in dream" effectively reweights the opening's promise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The waterfall-as-veil-between-worlds constrains Arin's method and the parapet provides the specific location for his loom construction. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sap-stained fingers, bronze tuning fork's "radiant hush"). The gray city across the gorge effectively contrasts with the verdant parapet. Some metaphorical density ("threads of liquid light") occasionally obscures physical reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder before children forget sunrise—escalates through the loom's construction to its buckling under world-pressure, forcing Arin's pivotal choice to release rather than hoard. Cost is visible in the loom's sacrifice and Arin aging "suddenly older yet lighter." The reversal from capturing to releasing is earned but the gray city's transformation feels slightly convenient without shown resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of hoarding-to-sharing, with the sapling's impossible existence ("roots half in soil, half in dream") as a non-literal answer to preserving wonder. The recurring color/wonder motif accumulates meaning, especially when droplets burst into "silent fireworks." The final image of warmth before sunrise effectively reweights the opening's "hush of budding hope."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combining horticultural precision ("notching heirloom seed into every intersection") with lyrical compression ("color gathered—coral, indigo, gold"). POV remains stable with Arin throughout. Some elevated diction ("tentonic, then torrential") occasionally drifts from the established register. The perceptual signature of seeing-as-pruner (varieties of fruit, grafting metaphors) is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the ritual sequences. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tentonic, then torrential" laughter) and some abstract phrasing around wonder/essence that reduces immediacy. The template phrase "Arin [verb]" appears frequently enough to create mild repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of horticultural craft with metaphysical color-preservation offers a fresh angle on the preservation-of-wonder theme. The specific detail of grafting techniques applied to abstract concepts creates originality. The transformation from physical orchardist to metaphysical wanderer subverts expectations. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and abstract concept mostly succeeds though occasionally tips toward allegory.</comment>
