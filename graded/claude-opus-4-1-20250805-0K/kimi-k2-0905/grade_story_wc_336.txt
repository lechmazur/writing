<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and embodied through concrete actions like building the willow loom and capturing color droplets. The final choice to release rather than hoard wonder shows genuine internal conflict resolved with visible cost—the loom's collapse and his aging. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "essence" and "wonder" that occasionally drifts toward conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Arin's transformation from hoarder to distributor of wonder creates a Decisive Change with visible cost (aging, loom destruction). The pattern of pruning, weaving, and capturing builds density toward the release moment. Cost is legible when he "suddenly older yet lighter" accepts his wandering role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The verdant parapet, waterfall's veil, and willow loom create vivid micro-settings that constrain choices—mist enables the loom's function, the waterfall becomes a portal. Sensory details like "fingers stained with sap and soil" and colors "swirling above seed-knots" ground the fantastical. The setting actively shapes tactics through the loom's placement "within mist's reach."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) escalates from personal mission to world-changing release when the weave "tugged back, hungry for borrowed brilliance." The reversal from capturing to releasing creates meaningful pressure with visible cost—the loom's destruction and Arin's transformation. The final image of the sapling "half in soil, half in dream" crystallizes the new equilibrium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of wonder as transferable essence—not hoarded but shared. The heirloom seed's transformation from preserved lineage to living conduit reweights the opening's focus on preservation. The final image of children laughing beneath the chiming tree offers a non-literal answer about wonder's perpetuation through dispersal rather than containment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistent mystical register with controlled imagery like "threads of liquid light weaving between worlds." Some elevated diction ("tentonic," "succor") fits the fable-like tone though occasionally strains. The perceptual signature—seeing color as essence, hearing lullabies as stitches—creates a distinct focalization despite occasional drift toward omniscient summary in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "color of wonder" (appears 4 times) and some abstract loops around "essence" that could be more concrete. The prose serves the lyric mode but occasionally sacrifices clarity for atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of wonder as harvestable pigment that bleeds between worlds offers a fresh angle on the preservation-versus-sharing tension. The willow loom as living technology and the specific image of grafting "a single twig onto the air itself" show genuine invention. The transformation from orchard pruner to interdimensional wonder-distributor synthesizes familiar elements in unexpected ways.</comment>
