<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker's journey from mapping external territories to confronting his unmapped interior shows genuine transformation with visible cost. His internal contradiction between professional mastery and personal avoidance plays out through embodied sensation (citrus frequencies, warm ink through pores). The final choice to become "parchment and ink and reader all at once" pays off his earlier fear of touching his own blank interior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the stillpoint where "sound inverted" and the mapmaker receives his interior cartography. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he accepts becoming the map itself, with visible cost in carrying emotional topography "beneath the skin." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through synesthetic perception and pays it off when "musical notes rearranging into a new melody" he composes by walking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions as more than setting—its "dark green walls" actively guide him and its frequencies become navigational tools. The platinum ring serves as micro-setting that constrains choice by accumulating "consonants of extinct birds, vowels of children who would never be born" until it must release at the stillpoint. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from external mapmaking to confronting "his own interior stayed blank, a parchment he feared to touch." The musical trail tightening into a spiral creates accumulative pressure that forces entry at the stillpoint. Cost is legible when he must "become the map, parchment and ink and reader all at once"—foreclosing his previous distance from emotion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of a blind mapmaker who charts everything except himself, resolved when mapping becomes embodied rather than externalized. The final image of him carrying maps "beneath the skin" and transferring them through touch offers a non-literal answer about how we navigate emotion. Subtext operates through synesthetic perception where sound becomes taste, vibration becomes map.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic narration where the mapmaker tastes frequencies and reads Braille of sound. Voice maintains lyric consistency through metaphoric density without becoming opaque. Psychic distance stays close third throughout, with diction appropriate to both technical mapmaking and sensory immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("cane tapping, following the only trail he trusted"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("consonants of extinct birds, vowels of children who would never be born") but serves the synesthetic conceit. Minor repetition of "ultrasonic forest" and occasional abstract phrasing ("uncharted emotional depths") but momentum sustains through varied syntax and strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker who navigates by absorbed languages transforms the expected disability narrative into exploration of emotional cartography. The synesthetic perception system (tasting frequencies, skin reading vibrations) creates fresh sensory logic. The resolution where maps transfer through touch rather than sight offers non-obvious synthesis of the premise.</comment>
