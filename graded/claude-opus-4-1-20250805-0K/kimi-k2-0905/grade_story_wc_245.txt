<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker's motivation builds through concrete sensory details and embodied emotion, with his quest to map internal terrain driving coherent choices. The contradiction between his external mastery and internal blindness creates genuine tension, though some moments of interiority edge toward abstraction ("countries no one else had yet imagined").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the mapmaker internalizes his emotional geography with visible cost ("rivers of unsent apology"). The stillpoint discovery and ring's release create meaningful deepening, though the orientation anchors arrive gradually rather than immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions as active constraint, its frequencies tasted as "citrus on his tongue" while its walls "tighten" to guide him. The platinum ring and musical trail operate as micro-settings that constrain choice, particularly when the ring grows "bloated with consonants of extinct birds."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping one's interior emotional terrain—deepens through the ring's accumulating weight and the spiral's tightening pressure. Cost becomes legible when he traces "ridges of joy, valleys of regret" and accepts carrying them "beneath the skin," though escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of cartography as self-knowledge, with the final image of "private meridian zero" reweighting all navigation. The story resists easy resolution, embracing complexity in lines like "to navigate uncharted emotional depths one must become the map."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—the blind mapmaker experiences through taste, vibration, and tactile reading. Voice maintains lyric control with purposeful compression ("Behind him the stillpoint dissolved into rumor") and no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The platinum compass ring released its hoarded languages in one silver rush"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("tender blaze that survives after anger burns out") but momentum remains strong through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, mapmaking, and emotional cartography creates a non-obvious exploration of self-knowledge. The ultrasonic forest and synesthetic perception ("taste their frequencies as citrus") elevate familiar introspection themes through specific sensory innovation.</comment>
