<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nara's motivation to subvert genetic control is clear and consistent, with internal contradictions embodied through her telepathic plant connection versus her insurgent goals. The final choice to alter the embryo carries visible cost (risking capture, physical pain from aging knees). Minor deduction for the guard's too-convenient soporific response lacking sufficient setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Nara successfully alters the embryo, fundamentally subverting the council's breeding program with clear on-page cost (physical struggle, risk of capture). The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages from kite discovery to decoding to embryo alteration. Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs setting actively constrains choices (specific temperature threshold, slick stairs challenge aging body) and provides the crucial resource for embryo revival. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("hissed like restless spirits," "mineral clouds swirled like galaxies"). Environment doesn't quite reach the 9-band as it could more deeply shape the final tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (subverting genetic control) signaled early and escalates through discovery of kite coordinates, descent into grotto, guard encounter, and successful alteration. The guard encounter provides meaningful tightening that forces immediate action. Cost is visible in Nara's physical struggle and risk, though the soporific resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of evolution versus tradition emerges organically through Nara's actions to "scramble that program the way gardeners splice rogue vines." The final image of plants rustling with "conspiratorial pride" resonantly reweights the opening reconstruction without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively through the kite's cryptic message and Nara's plant communication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the world through Nara's plant-telepathy lens ("tomatoes blush and cedars gossip"). Voice modulates appropriately with pressure, tightening during the guard encounter. Some elevated diction ("soporific pollen," "epigenetic switches") slightly strains the POV's plausible lexicon given her characterization as "little peach."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("photosynthetic panic flared") and some register drift into scientific terminology that doesn't fully align with Nara's established voice ("epigenetic switches," "thermophilic moss").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genetic engineering with volcanic hot springs and plant telepathy creates an organic, non-obvious combination. The transformation of "implanted destiny" through grandmother-as-insurgent avoiding rifles for biological rebellion shows genuine originality. The specific detail of reading kite script backward "as roots drink whole" demonstrates imaginative world-building.</comment>
