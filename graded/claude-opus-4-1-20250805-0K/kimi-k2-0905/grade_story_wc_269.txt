<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as witness, with embodied reactions like "the delayed revelation stir like an eel waking in her chest." The final choice to continue witnessing carries visible cost—her isolation and eternal vigil. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("genocide with photographs") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure with Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira discovers her true role shifts from documenting loss to maintaining readiness for renewal. The cost is clear: eternal solitary witness duty. The revelation about Path 27 and the hidden reef creates meaningful deepening that reweights her purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The monitoring station and underwater ruins effectively constrain choices and enable discovery. Vivid sensory detail like "headlights cutting green tunnels" and "limestone ridge shaved clean of life." The hidden reef site directly shapes the closure revelation, though some setting details remain decorative rather than pressure-inducing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine monitoring to discovering the hidden message to underwater exploration, with each discovery narrowing Mira's path forward. The tapping pattern creates coherent pressure linking surface to depths. Cost is visible in Mira's acceptance of perpetual witness duty, though the middle section could tighten pressure further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the reef's hidden preservation system—loss isn't erasure but patient waiting for renewal. The "Path 27—Witness Return" revelation reweights Mira's entire role without stating a moral. Strong resonance between ecological recovery and human witness, with the tapping rhythm serving as connective tissue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("white mantis above the lagoon") and consistent marine/ecological register. Some filter verb clusters ("she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in middle sections. The perceptual signature of a marine scientist is clear but occasionally drifts toward overly literary diction that strains against Mira's practical role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing images, but middle sections suffer from abstract phrasing ("assembly of clues," "delayed revelation") and some synonym loops around discovery/understanding. Template cadence appears in the descent sequence ("Down through...she descended...until the seafloor rose"). Information density is good but undermined by occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of witness as both recorder and keeper of renewal pathways offers fresh angle on post-climate fiction. The hidden reef preservation system and holographic ecosystem storage show originality. However, some elements feel familiar (lone scientist at remote station), preventing higher scores despite the strong conceptual synthesis.</comment>
