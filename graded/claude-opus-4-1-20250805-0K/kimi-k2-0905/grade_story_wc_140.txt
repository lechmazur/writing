I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered fragments toward Mara's final act of memory restoration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove her existence through collected fragments is viscerally embodied in her movements through the container maze and her physical interactions with found objects. The captain's death and her choice to invert the poison's purpose shows genuine agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("certain that if she pressed enough voices together...") that slightly dulls the immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Mara transforms from erased to memory-preserver, with the cost visible in her remaining namelessness while enabling others' remembrance. The accumulative structure builds coherently through collected fragments to this reversal. Deducted for slight orientation delay (who/where crystallizes slowly) and the captain's exposition dump which, while thematically relevant, stalls the otherwise strong textural momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as both physical maze and metaphor for bureaucratic erasure, with specific details like "sodium light" bleeding "yellow halos" and containers groaning "like whales." The setting actively constrains Mara's movements and provides the surfaces for her memory-restoration project, making it essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to collective memory preservation, with the poison label discovery and captain's revelation effectively tightening pressure. The cost is visible in Mara's choice to remain nameless while restoring others. The accumulative build works well though the captain's info-dump slightly deflates immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between bureaucratic erasure and human persistence, with the poison label's inversion providing elegant thematic reversal. The final image of workers hearing "phantom whistles and familiar laughter" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the captain's overly explicit thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Mara experiencing the world through "lungs counting the cadence of brine and machinery" and distinctive rhythmic prose. Voice maintains consistency through pressure though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("sedimentary layers," "recalcitrant histories") that slightly strains the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "lips the color of wet ash" and effective rhythm variation. However, several instances of overwriting ("the texture of memories would emerge," "filtering reality differently," "recalcitrant histories") and some template cadence in the middle sections. The final paragraph's dense figurative language somewhat obscures the closure's clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of bureaucratic erasure through clerical error offers a fresh angle on identity loss, and the inversion of poison-as-memory-restorer shows genuine ingenuity. The specific port setting with its container labyrinth provides original texture though some elements feel derivative of dystopian memory-erasure narratives.</comment>
