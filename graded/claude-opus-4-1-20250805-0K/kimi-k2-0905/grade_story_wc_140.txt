<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reconstruct identity through collected fragments is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (pocketing shards, taping fragments to chest). The internal contradiction between accepting death and desperately gathering stories creates genuine tension. Micro-choices reveal values through specific actions like swallowing sentences "like communion," though some interiority edges toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist walks toward harbor "stitched from many mouths, shimmering yet solid." Cost is visible in the erasure of official identity and the desperate layering process. The piece teaches its pattern early and maintains coherent pressure through fragment collection, though the ending cuts off mid-sentence preventing full closure assessment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth functions as both setting and metaphor, with metal walls that "filter reality differently" constraining perception and movement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (frost curling "like old cassette ribbon," tide drumming "bass line under metal floors"). The environment actively shapes choices through its maze structure and tidal rhythms, charging the final image of containers as a "press, compressing voices into laminate skin."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconstructing identity after bureaucratic erasure is clear from opening. Pressure accumulates through fragment collection with one meaningful deepening when protagonist realizes "the labyrinth is not a maze but a press." The tidal clock creates urgency. Cost is legible in the desperate act of taping borrowed memories to chest as "armor of overheard existence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically through concrete encounters (woman counting ampoules, boy sketching vanished neighborhood). The container labyrinth as repository of "erased histories reverberating through hollow walls" resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of a figure "stitched from many mouths" offers a non-literal answer to identity erasure, though the truncated ending prevents full thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("death certificate error survivor whose pulse still startled dockhands"). Perceptual signature filters everything through the lens of erasure and reconstruction. Purposeful compression and patterned elision work within the accumulative mode. The metaphorical density serves pressure without becoming opaque, maintaining consistent POV throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere). Strong rhythmic control and syntactic variety. Some figurative density in peak beats ("laminate skin," "calcify into a new name") but coherent within the lyric mode. The truncated final sentence prevents full assessment of prose closure, though what exists shows strong control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle on identity erasure through the specific mechanism of clerical error and the concrete response of fragment collection. The shipping container setting as filter for reality and repository of stories feels original. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes. The concept of layering overheard stories to "stay three-dimensional" offers genuine novelty.</comment>
