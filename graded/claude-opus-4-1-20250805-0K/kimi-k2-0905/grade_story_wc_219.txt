<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism drives consistent investigation with clear internal conflict between wanting to believe and needing proof. Her final choice to warn humanity shows agency with implied cost, though the emotional stakes could be more visceral. The fly amber pendant works as embodied connection to pre-visitor Earth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discoveries about the visitors' true purpose as "collectors of belonging." The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—understanding the visitors harvest human emotions—but cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt. The story establishes clear who/where/when early and maintains coherent causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sculpture garden with its bronze figures and convergent paths creates atmospheric pressure, particularly when electromagnetic frequencies spike through the hollow statue. Setting subtly guides investigation routes. The rainwashed tower bookends effectively though doesn't constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the visitors' true purpose) deepens through discoveries: glowing footprints → strange compounds → neural response patterns → emotional harvesting revelation. Pressure accumulates but lacks a sharp tightening moment where Mara must sacrifice something tangible. The "chemistry of homecoming" concept drives investigation without forcing hard trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central question of authentic versus manufactured belonging, with the fly amber representing "pure memory" against artificial pilgrimage. The ending reweights earlier material when Mara understands belonging can be "harvested from your heart." Some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("the most dangerous") rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with academic voice fitting Mara's character, though prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("bronze quiet of evening"). Some filter-heavy constructions ("She understood then") reduce immediacy. Perceptual signature emerges in scientific observation mode but lacks distinctive rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrase structures ("She had," "She walked," "She understood") create template cadence, particularly in opening sequences. "Bronze quiet" appears three times without evolving meaning. Some overwritten passages ("luminous skeptic," "faithful companion") clash with scientific POV. Information density varies; several paragraphs restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of aliens as "collectors of belonging" who harvest emotional experiences offers a fresh angle on first contact stories. Specific details like the electromagnetic frequencies through bronze statues and the "chemistry of homecoming" formula ground the premise. However, execution relies on familiar investigation beats without surprising structural choices.</comment>
