Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it through the lens of a demanding editor seeking immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This reads as **Causal** - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from Vey's discovery of the amulet fragment through the bargain with the technicians to the final crossing of the threshold.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vey's immortal boredom drives genuine choices, particularly the bargain to help the technicians in exchange for reaching the door. The final choice between remembering and proceeding lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("centuries cracking like ice") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from fragment discovery through technician encounter to threshold crossing, with clear cost (Vey's existence as he knows it). The closure achieves Decisive Change with Vey choosing to proceed into unmarked darkness. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the final darkness sequence which, while resonant, loses some concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite creates vivid atmosphere with "crystalline corridors folding back on themselves" and walls that "remembered every footstep." The solar storm actively constrains timing. However, the wooden door's plainness contrasts too sharply with the established fantastical setting without sufficient bridging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal boredom to the technicians' mutiny to Vey's existential choice. The amulet's compulsion creates genuine pressure. The final cost is clear but somewhat abstract ("formerly infinite heart"), limiting full emotional impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings and what follows goodbye emerges organically through action. The amulet's curse of "direction" resonates with Vey's directionless immortality. Final deduction for the slightly overwrought "hush so complete it rang like thunder" which edges toward forced profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sandcastles—fun for a moment, then merely grit between toes"). POV remains stable. Some register elevation in peak moments ("unmarked, unmeasured, unruled") doesn't quite match established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Möbius sigh," "polar hunger"). However, repetitive "hush" motif (appears 4 times) and some overwrought constructions ("hollows of his formerly infinite heart") create minor density issues without payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal ennui with spatial rebellion creates unexpected resonance. The cursed amulet as compass for the directionless is inventive. The technicians' mutiny as means rather than obstacle shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
