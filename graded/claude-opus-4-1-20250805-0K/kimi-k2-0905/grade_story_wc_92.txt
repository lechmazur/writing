<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Garnet's internal "cradle of sparks" metaphor for obedience turning to invention provides clear motivation, and her micro-choices (tracing angles, bridging terminals) reveal values under pressure. The characterization loses some points for occasional label-speak ("vigilant lock sentinel") and the somewhat convenient competence in both lock-picking and electrical engineering without established expertise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where the fort transforms from locked military control to "unlocked in every sense," with visible cost in the freed sky-barges and neutral banners. The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages (blackout enables conspiracy → sparks transferred → chains released → revolution succeeds). Minor orientation delay (who/where crystallizes gradually) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort setting constrains choices effectively—the blackout creates opportunity, the chain-room and generator locations drive the dual-pronged plan, and the bronze quill holder functions as both tool and signal. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from postern gate to keep to wall-walk. The "compressed aether" worldbuilding and sky-barges add specificity without overwhelming the narrative scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully when Commander Voss's arrival forces Garnet to improvise, using misdirection rather than confrontation—a choice that narrows her options and demonstrates agency under pressure. The cost becomes visible in the freed sky-barges and the fort's transformation. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though the relatively smooth execution of the plan limits tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" concept elegantly unifies personal transformation (obedience to invention) with mechanical action (generator sparks) and revolutionary change (spreading possibility). The final image of Garnet unmasking as sunrise arrives offers a non-literal answer to the freedom/control question. Theme emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, particularly in the line "Tell the ministry that their ink has dried; we write tomorrow with light."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with inventive phrases ("murdered torch bracket," "kites snagging on surprise") and controlled psychic distance. However, some diction feels elevated beyond Garnet's plausible lexicon ("gnomon," "aether valves"), and occasional filter-verb clusters ("felt," "saw," "recognized") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops appear ("stood unlocked in every sense" restates the prior description). Template cadence emerges in places ("Garnet traced...Garnet answered...Garnet unrolled"). The "winking hush" and "cradle of sparks" phrases risk overuse, though they serve thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The steampunk-fantasy fusion of ministry bureaucracy with aether-powered technology offers fresh texture, and the specific invention of using a bronze quill holder as both symbolic object and functional tool shows ingenuity. The revolution-through-technical-sabotage approach transforms familiar rebellion tropes. The sundial-as-cipher device provides original specificity.</comment>
