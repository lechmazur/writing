I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through pattern and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Garnet's motivation crystallizes through the "cradle of sparks" metaphor—obedience turning to invention—with embodied tension in pressing her cheek to cold iron and feeling sparks expand in her chest. The final unmasking carries visible cost as she transforms from sentinel to revolutionary. Minor deduction for Luce remaining more functional than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the fort transforms from "luminous" prison to "unlocked in every sense," with sky-barges drifting "like startled swans" as visible cost. The accumulative pattern coheres through shadow-angles, sparked generators, and freed chains. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (Garnet, fort, postern gate, blackout).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blackout becomes active setting—enabling conspiracy while endangering garrison—with specific mechanics like "compressed aether" cages and bronze conducting stray energy. The sundial's coded angles constrain tactical choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gate to keep to chain-room to wall-walk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: graphite translating angles, bronze conducting sparks, chains slackening, barges drifting free. Commander Voss provides brief complication that Garnet navigates through deception. The dominant stake—revolution versus obedience—tightens when she must perform loyalty while sabotaging, though mid-story pressure could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" metaphor deepens from personal rebellion to systemic transformation—"every dark corridor inhaled possibility." The final image of Garnet unmasked, sharing a "winking hush" with sunrise, reweights the opening's vigilant sentinel into architect of change. Theme emerges through action without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "soft as moth wings," "thin kites snagging on surprise." POV remains tightly focused through Garnet's perception with purposeful compression. Minor dialogue ("Tell the ministry that their ink has dried") carries subtext effectively, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs: "Footsteps approached, soft as moth wings" establishes both action and atmosphere. Some elevated diction ("luminous fort's postern gate," "consensual reality") occasionally drifts from the established register. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis combining steampunk elements (aether valves, gear-driven lanterns) with revolutionary intrigue through specific details like the Ministry of Ink's bronze quill holder doubling as sabotage tool. The "cradle of sparks" concept transforms from metaphor to literal generator manipulation, avoiding generic rebellion narrative.</comment>
