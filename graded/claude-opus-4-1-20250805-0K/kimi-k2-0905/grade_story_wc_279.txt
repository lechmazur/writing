<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal journey from seeking meaning to understanding it as "motion to repeat" shows genuine transformation with visible cost (destroying her mandala). Her embodied responses to the hush and the tile flake's whispers create concrete interiority. The "socially perceptive" trait manifests through her reading of silence as congregation rather than absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: Mira's understanding shifts from seeking permanent meaning to embracing ephemeral creation cycles. The mandala's destruction and her return to the plaza demonstrate clear cost—she must repeatedly lose her work to find meaning. Orientation anchors clearly (grotto, twilight, the unlearning week).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto functions as more than setting—its "emergent hush" and response to the mandala constrain Mira's actions. Sensory details ("lilac unease" as color on skin, "scent of rain on hot brick") are vivid and POV-filtered. The plaza's blank flagstones enable the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from listening to the grotto, to creating the mandala, to receiving the tile's message, to destroying her creation. The dominant stake (finding meaning in impermanence) tightens when she must destroy what she's built. Cost is visible in the scattered sand and her acceptance of endless cycles of creation/erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mandala's creation/destruction cycle and the tile flake's message: "The mess is the only place unfinished enough to welcome you." The final image of Mira creating ephemeral chalk art that will vanish under "shoes and rain" offers a non-literal answer about meaning residing in process, not product.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("the mist forgot its own name," "inside a pearl"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("emergent hush thickened") but largely consistent with the whimsical artist POV. Perceptual signature evident in how Mira reads patterns and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional overwriting appears ("lilac unease" repeated 4 times, some abstract phrasing like "meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph lengths. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She + verb" patterns).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of finding meaning through erasure and impermanence offers a fresh angle on artistic creation. The sand mandala/chalk art pairing creates organic synthesis. The "unlearning" week and whispering grotto avoiding typical mystical tropes through specific, grounded execution.</comment>
