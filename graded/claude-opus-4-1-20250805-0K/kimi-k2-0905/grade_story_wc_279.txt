<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal journey from seeking external meaning to understanding "meaning was not a shape to keep but a motion to repeat" shows genuine transformation with visible cost (destroying her mandala). Her contradictory impulses—preserving vs. erasing—play out through concrete actions rather than summary, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing ("every absence in the world had gathered here").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure when Mira destroys the mandala and embraces impermanence—the cost is her life's work and the tile flake's destruction. The pattern of creation-erasure-recreation coheres throughout, though orientation arrives late (grotto location/valley context unclear until mid-story).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's "emergent hush" and mandala patterns constrain Mira's choices effectively—she must work in silence, respond to the space's demands. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("lilac unease" as both color and feeling), though some descriptions lean ornamental ("stood inside a pearl").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal meaning-seeking to accepting impermanence with visible cost—the tile flake crumbles, the mandala scatters. The tension between preservation and erasure deepens through the mandala creation until Mira chooses destruction, though coincidence (the grotto's response) partially enables resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the creation-destruction cycle without explicit moralizing—the final plaza drawing that will "vanish under shoes and rain" resonates as necessary completion. The recurring spiral motif and "mess" concept charge the ending where children will "hop the lines" in unknowing participation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, though prose occasionally drifts into elevated register beyond Mira's plausible lexicon ("congregration," "radial storm"). The voice maintains distinctness through selective perception (chalk artist noticing textures, patterns) but loses some immediacy through filter constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mist forgot its own name") but suffers from ornamental density and register drift in peak beats. Template cadence appears in final paragraphs ("She walked...She signed...Behind her") and abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("meaning felt like chalk dust on her tongue—present but unformed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chalk art's impermanence with existential meaning-making feels fresh and earned—particularly the insight that erasure is "the final, necessary stroke." The whispering gallery tile carrying accumulated secrets that must dissolve transforms familiar elements, though some mystical aspects (grotto's sentience) trend toward convention.</comment>
