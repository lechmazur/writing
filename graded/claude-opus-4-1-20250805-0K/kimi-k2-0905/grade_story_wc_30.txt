<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation to preserve wonder despite her own shifting identity creates genuine internal contradiction, embodied through the brass/biological hybrid nature. The acceptance of contradictory identities ("the sailor who feared depth, the moth who loved flame") demonstrates layered characterization. However, the piece lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure that would elevate beyond the 7-band, and the final renunciation feels more philosophical than dramatically earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the librarian accepts perpetual transformation as her nature. The piece teaches its pattern early ("tomorrow dissolve into foam") and maintains coherent pressure through moon-phase constraints and identity dissolution. Cost is visible in the hollow she maintains "shaped exactly like tomorrow when it still existed." Deduction for slight orientation delay (who/what anchors emerge gradually) but the pattern pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as active constraint—water levels force timing ("worked while the wintersun serenity lasted"), moon phases alter the net's capabilities, and the submerged archive determines possible actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt settled on brass like frost that had never heard of cold"). The environment directly shapes the final choice to plant the creel, anchoring the archive to seabed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving identities/wonder escalates through moon-phase pressure and the threat of scattering ("if she did not anchor them, they would scatter and grow into storms of forgetting"). The tightening occurs when she must forge contradictory identities into one ribbon before dissolution. Cost appears in accepting her own designation will "tilt" and the hollow where tomorrow existed, though agency could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of accepting contradiction as essential to wonder emerges through concrete action (smelting identities, planting the creel) rather than statement. The litany "I am the echo and the canyon" provides earned wisdom through embodied paradox. The final promise to "routine you into stars, but never cage your orbit" resonates without moralizing, and the creel's expansion for "the contradiction she had not yet become" deepens without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through mechanical-organic fusion ("gears clicked, extending a filament net") and poetic compression ("the moon, three nights past full, tugged at both the seawater and the edges of her own name"). Voice maintains consistency through lyric accumulation without head-hopping. The prose modulates naturally with pressure, condensing during the smelting sequence and expanding in contemplative moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The bamboo creel answered with a soft crack, expanding one ring, making room for the contradiction she had not yet become"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, though occasional elevated diction ("wintersun serenity") slightly exceeds the established register. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, and the figurative language serves the hybrid nature rather than decorating.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian as mechanical-organic hybrid offers genuine freshness, avoiding both pure robot and pure magical being. The concept of identities as physical objects to be smelted and preserved transforms familiar memory/identity themes through specific embodiment. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and acceptance of perpetual transformation over resolution heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
