<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to provide "flawless goodbyes" through music therapy is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied emotions like the kalimba pressed to chest and the vinyl shard as tactile memory. The final realization that "reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward" shows meaningful internal change earned through the dramatized scene. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("decisively kind" repeated twice) and slightly convenient emotional calibration in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sensory layering (dishwater blood, bleach smell, petrichor) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara understands reunification means "carry both pieces forward." The closure lands with visible cost through Calderon's death and the daughter's drought-breaking tears. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (hospice, Room 914, Mr. Calderon).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cloud-level hospice with glass floors creates unique spatial pressure, and sensory details like "bleach and resignation" effectively filter through Mara's professional POV. The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when pressed to Calderon's wrist. Some generic descriptors ("amber lamplight," "velvet held underwater") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of providing a "flawless goodbye" faces escalation through Calderon's confession "I never learned to end things clean" and deepens when Mara plays "the scent of hope" into sound. Cost is visible in the monitor flattening and Calderon's death. The piece relies more on accumulation than reversal, appropriate for its textural lens, though the single tightening moment limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the broken record motif—two halves that "did not seal" yet form a "lightning bolt frozen mid-flash," offering a non-literal answer about carrying loss forward rather than repair. The final image of Mara pressing the reunited disk to her sternum while understanding "reunify does not mean repair" resonates without moralizing. Some abstraction in "the scent of hope" prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in how Mara translates ordinary sounds into music ("squeak of nurse shoes, the rattle of meal carts"). Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Thought vinyl was extinct"/"Only the intact ones"). Register drift into elevated diction ("cumulus cities," "radiant haven") occasionally breaks from Mara's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears in metaphors like "darkness felt like velvet held underwater" and "monitor's peaks softened into gentle hills." Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears 3+ times consecutively. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story but some descriptive passages could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of music therapy with the broken record metaphor for grief offers a fresh angle on death/acceptance narratives. The specific detail of "hymning the mundane" by transforming hospital sounds into music shows originality. The piece commits to its lyrical mode but doesn't take significant structural risks that would merit the 8+ bonus.</comment>
