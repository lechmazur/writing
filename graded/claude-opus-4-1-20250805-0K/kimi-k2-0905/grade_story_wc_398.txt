<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's internal contradiction between staying and letting go operates through concrete choices (keeping the letter fragment, nurturing mismatched vines), though some epiphanies arrive too cleanly. The final renunciation—accepting separation as transformation—carries visible cost through 37 years of solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and vineyard details layer toward Marcus's recognition that "staying could be the bravest journey." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he reframes the burned letter from "wound" to "window," with 37 years of isolation as the felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vineyard's terraced architecture constrains Marcus's choices—mismatched plantings force experimental grafting techniques that mirror his emotional journey. Amber pavilion's stained glass and copper roof create atmospheric pressure, particularly when "grape-colored shadows" charge the final meditation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through layered recognitions about the vines teaching acceptance, though escalation remains internal without external complication. The dominant stake—understanding why he stayed—tightens when he realizes Sarah knew "some loves could only express their true nature through struggle."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the vineyard's "destined mismatches" becoming "something new entirely," avoiding explicit moralizing until Marcus's realization. The final image of folding the letter as "no longer a wound but a window" offers resonant answer without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("amber light like a dying ember"), though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("intersubjective understanding"). The perceptual signature—seeing emotional parallels in viticulture—remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of precise beauty ("tasted what Sarah had known") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "burned love letter edge" (5 mentions) and abstract terms like "passionate subtlety." Some sentences restate rather than advance: "Marcus remained behind as he always did, the lone vineyard sentinel."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The parallel between mismatched grape varietals thriving in wrong soil and mismatched love finding meaning through separation offers fresh angle on loss. However, the vineyard-as-metaphor framework follows familiar templates without surprising transformation.</comment>
