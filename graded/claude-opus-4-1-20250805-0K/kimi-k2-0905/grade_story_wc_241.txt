<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between rational caution and compulsive searching drives authentic choices, particularly in her midnight subway hunts and the final renunciation. The father-daughter dynamic through absence creates genuine pressure. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("clover melancholy") rather than pure embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Mara's forgiveness and renunciation of the gambling pattern carries visible cost ("no longer tempted to bet"). The cryptic scrawls accumulate meaning toward the mezzanine revelation. Slight dock for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when/where.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned mezzanine functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("copper smell of electrified risk"). The mica pane's light refraction in the ending creates a strong setting-as-resolution moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on Mara's need to decode her father's legacy versus maintaining her "responsible" distance. The mezzanine discovery deepens rather than reverses, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is legible in leaving the lantern burning—forsaking the hunt that defined their relationship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the infinity equation, "burn the house down with its own matches," and the final scrawl about believing "the past is fixed." The ending reweights all prior gambling metaphors into a framework about forgiveness without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in how Mara reads probability into everything ("each drop felt weighted, like dice mid-roll"). Voice maintains consistency through compression and expansion. Some register elevation in descriptive passages doesn't quite match Mara's analytical baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong propulsion with vivid verb choices and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("planetarium of second chances") and some filter-verb clustering in reflection passages. The "clover melancholy" repetition feels forced rather than pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The subway scrawls as father-daughter communication system offers a fresh angle on grief and inheritance. The probability professor's daughter inheriting a gambler's apology creates organic irony. Some elements feel convenient (perfectly timed appearance of fresh clover).</comment>
