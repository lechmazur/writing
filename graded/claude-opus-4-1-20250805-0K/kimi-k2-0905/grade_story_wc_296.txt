I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding literary standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Briar's motivation is powerfully embodied through the flesh-eating seed that "tasted her" and her confession that "scraped out like blades withdrawn from wet stone." The internal contradiction between her need for connection and her destructive touch creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the confession arriving somewhat abruptly without enough prior dramatization of the village burning choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Briar's confession transforms the vortex's rotation and her relationship with the plant that "chose not to devour." The cost is visceral—she's half-bound, neither "guardian" nor "trespasser" but both. The expanding circles method creates clear causality from entry to confession to transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex with "leafless apple trees rotating slowly, trunks creaking like old siege towers" creates vivid atmosphere that constrains choice—Briar must navigate the floating roots in expanding circles. The flesh-eating seed and mirrored water actively shape the confession moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the widening gyre as "apples frozen mid-rot bobbed like skulls" until the seventh circle forces the confession. The cost is immediate—the seed sprouts and binds her arm, making her transformation physical and irreversible. The vortex's reversal at closure demonstrates clear consequence of her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths demanding embodied confession emerges organically through the failed mirror trick and the lake that "could drink it and the roots could record it." The final image of confession "growing, ring by ring, into the timber of tomorrow's storms" offers resonant non-literal answer to what mirrors cannot show.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density: "prayer bead and not a death sentence," "blood had steamed on the ice like a war banner planted too early." The perceptual signature remains consistent—a druid who speaks "only to things that could not answer" yet finds the lake answering. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands: "roots could record it in their slow rings," though occasionally dense ("the locked fence of her ribs"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in places like "unhidden war" and some template cadence in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druid mythology with the concept of confessions that refuse to be frozen, demanding embodied speech. The flesh-eating plant that becomes ally through blood-memory is particularly original. The warlike serenity tone creates memorable tension throughout. The specific cost of letting a village burn for personal connection avoids safety-hedging.</comment>
