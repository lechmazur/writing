<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gryphon's internal contradiction between loneliness and the need for independence drives genuine conflict, particularly in her refusal of the chorus's seductive offer. Her choice to remain singular despite the "brittle awakening" cracking inside her sternum shows earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses isolation as independence, with the cost visible in her deliberate solitude. The stone circle's offer and her refusal create the meaningful tightening that narrows options, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal library with its salt-crystal volumes and moon-drawn breath creates a vivid, constraining environment that shapes her choices. The brass sundial becomes instrumental when she rotates it to mark "the moment of her deciding," though more tactile interaction with the setting during key beats would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of translating isolation into independence escalates through the stone circle's temptation, forcing her to choose between chorus comfort and singular cartography. The cost appears in her acceptance of aloneness, though the pressure could intensify more sharply between the offer and refusal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the gryphon's specific journey from brittle awakening to resonant solitude, with the blank codex page becoming "a tiny moon itself, a promise." The final image of breathing "alone together" with the library offers a non-literal answer to isolation versus connection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with phrases like "wings folded like a scholar closing a book" and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature remains distinct throughout, though occasional elevation ("atomically reflective") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, though "atomically reflective" appears twice without evolution and some passages edge toward overwriting ("continents of possibility that only a solitary cartographer could draw"). Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a last gryphon choosing independence over the ghosts of extinct species offers fresh emotional territory. The specific synthesis of tidal library, stone circle memories, and the choice to write "maps for others yet to come" creates an inevitable-feeling resolution from unique particulars.</comment>
