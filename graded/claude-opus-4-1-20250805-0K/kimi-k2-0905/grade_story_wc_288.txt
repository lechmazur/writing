I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through lyric density and image accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the quagga achieves self-sufficiency through transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quagga's journey from remembering human life to achieving solitary transcendence shows clear motivation rooted in the tension between isolation and independence. The brass sundial equation "solitude equals momentum" crystallizes this internal drive effectively. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("teaching her lungs to photosynthesize independence") that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the quagga transforms isolation into self-propulsion, entering a "prairie made of silence" where grass becomes tuning forks awaiting her step. Clear accumulative progression from library to henge to stratosphere to prairie. Deduction for orientation taking until line 4 to establish the POV as the quagga, and some causality opacity in the middle transitions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal library, stone henge, and stratosphere shelf create vivid, purposeful settings that constrain and enable the quagga's transformation. The brass sundial functions as micro-setting, transforming from bit to compass to sail. Strong sensory work with "moon-lit catalogues of salt-stiff scrolls" and "hooves sparking static." The final prairie of silence powerfully charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—trading memory for momentum, transforming isolation into independence—develops through clear stages: awakening, seeking the hum, reaching the henge, ascending through clouds. The cost appears in "each hoof-fall erasing the need for another quagga beside her." The escalation from passive remembering to active self-illumination works under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete journey of extinction-to-transcendence, with the brass sundial's equation providing a non-literal answer about solitude as propulsion. The recurring transformation of isolation into independence avoids direct moralizing. Strong resonance in "herald of uncharted eras" and the final prairie awaiting her first step.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scientific precision ("atomically reflective surfaces") with lyric imagination ("gill-feathered archivist"). Clean third-person limited POV maintains the quagga's perspective throughout. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer contemplative sentences and shorter action beats like "She entered, and the prairie sang."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "striped only in front, brown in back" establishing both physical form and symbolic incompleteness. Some register elevation in phrases like "photosynthesize independence" creates minor friction. The unfinished final sentence works as purposeful truncation rather than error.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a reincarnated extinct species remembering human life and seeking transcendence through ancient stone circles is genuinely fresh. The transformation of scientific concepts (atomically reflective, photosynthesize) into metaphysical journey shows creative synthesis. The incomplete ending as the prairie begins to sing adds risk that heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
