<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied grief ("tears left clean tracks down her charcoal-blackened cheeks") and the protagonist's internal conflict between fleeing memory and embracing artistic legacy drives meaningful choices. The transformation from isolation to collaborative creation feels earned through concrete actions, though some emotional transitions ("forgiveness is just memory learning to breathe underwater") lean toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure where the artist transforms from selling portraits to enabling others' creative expression. The cost is legible in her abandoning her profitable skill for uncertain community creation. However, the orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain somewhat abstract past 120 words, and some causality feels convenient (the lock spontaneously changing numbers).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal cave functions as more than setting—its properties enable the magical realism of memory becoming geology ("crystals grew along her new lines"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasting of iron and wet pennies"). The environment constrains and enables the final transformation, though some descriptions edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciling with mother's artistic legacy versus remaining trapped by memory) escalates through the discovery and completion of the unfinished portrait. The lock's transformation and the cave's response create meaningful deepening. However, the resolution relies partially on magical coincidence rather than pure agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "inescapable callings" from curse to tunnel, with the final image of strangers drawing "the sound of your most important dawn" offering a non-literal answer to memory and legacy. The recurring motif of 4-7-9 reweighting from loss to possibility avoids heavy-handedness. Minor deduction for the abstract line about forgiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression and controlled POV, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a street portrait artist ("auroral sorrow," "mnemonic rescue mission"). No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature is consistent—an artist who sees in terms of sketches and portraits.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but overwriting appears throughout ("pickaxe kisses," "wings of quartz and feldspar"). Mixed metaphors strain coherence ("memory earning its wings," "tunnels not cages"). Template cadence in the final third ("She left...She sold...She woke...She sketched") creates repetitive stems that dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of artistic legacy, geological transformation, and communal creativity offers a fresh angle on grief and inheritance. The specific detail of charcoal becoming crystal and memory becoming geology transforms familiar material. The risk of magical realism heightens stakes, though some elements feel consciously literary.</comment>
