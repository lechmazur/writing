Looking at this story through the lens of literary publication standards, I'll evaluate it as an Accumulative/Textural piece given its lyric density and pattern-based progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity manifests through concrete micro-choices (threading film, aligning horizons, stepping into the henge), with internal contradiction between thrill and fear effectively embodied when "it wrapped a cold hand around her ribs." The transformation from charting known to accepting mystery carries visible cost in her willingness to "frame future maps with room for mystery rather than mastery."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the henge's revelation reweights Elara's entire cartographic practice, with felt cost in surrendering mastery for "shielded openness." The accumulative structure builds through film comparison, henge entry, and map reknitting, though the final sentence cuts off mid-thought, slightly weakening the closure's completeness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and cliff-top henge function as active constraints—the "oval of silence" and sound-drinking spirals shape Elara's perception and choices. Exceptional sensory hierarchy with "not with ears but with the part of her that frames coastlines," making setting inseparable from character perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the mystery's layers (torn map → film evidence → physical henge → transformative silence), with meaningful deepening when Elara chooses patient witnessing over conquest. The cost manifests in her acceptance of "mystery rather than mastery," though escalation could tighten further in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the silence/listening motif, culminating in "the henge did not appear or disappear; it simply allowed itself to be noticed when someone was ready to listen without conquest." The map's self-repair beautifully concretizes the abstract theme of accepting mystery, avoiding any explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("perceptive map framer" consciousness shapes every observation), with prose rhythm modulating from methodical precision to lyric expansion in the henge. Clean focalization maintains Elara's limited knowledge while building dramatic irony about the henge's true nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Rain hissed against the leaded skylight...each drop a tiny hammer eroding the painted saints"). Some syntactic repetition in middle sections ("She loaded...she advanced...she pressed") creates mild momentum drag, but prose accelerates effectively toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and mysticism through specific details (hand-cranked viewer, frame-by-frame comparison, map that "pulse[s] faintly"). The concept of maps "breathing through ink" and henges that choose their witnesses transforms familiar survey/discovery tropes, though some elements feel slightly derivative of portal fiction.</comment>
