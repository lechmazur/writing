<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's internal conflict between preserving truth and confronting her mother's betrayal drives authentic stakes, with the lagoon exchange creating genuine moral complexity. The moment of kneeling "throat full of salt" after discovering the betrayal embodies emotion without therapy-speak. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory encryption that could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as Mireya trades future fragments for past truths, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she broadcasts the suppressed testimonies despite personal cost. The "kerosene onto a ready flame" image crystallizes both the danger and necessity of her choice. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 with character, role, and immediate situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Mireya must trade her future to decrypt the past. Beach debris grammar ("scallop edges for vowels, black urchin spines for stops") creates specific tactile detail. The gondola/zeppelin setting enables the final broadcast but could pressure choices more directly in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each decoded page costs years of Mireya's future ("futures closing like doors"), culminating in the mother's betrayal revelation that forces the broadcast decision. The "crown me or crucify me" acknowledgment shows clear understanding of consequences. One meaningful deepening satisfies this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ending's broadcast of names "now unerasable because they were spoken above the obsidian lagoon" offers a non-literal answer about how truth persists through sacrifice. The lagoon-as-memory-cipher avoids abstraction through concrete beach grammar exchanges. Theme emerges from the specific cost of preserving suppressed histories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("the dune-sheet parted like a sigh") and specific perceptual signature in how Mireya catalogues archive materials. Some register drift into academic abstraction ("retrocognitively trapped") that slightly distances from immediate experience. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong images like "ink bubbling" and "dark petals" floating up. Information density high in the beach debris grammar section. Deduction for conceptual abstraction around "encrypted memory" and some filter-heavy passages ("I felt years rearrange inside me") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lagoon-as-memory-cipher concept freshly reimagines archival discovery through visceral exchange rather than passive reading. The specific detail of constructing beach debris grammar to communicate with water transforms a potentially abstract concept. Risk-taking in the non-linear revelation structure pays off at closure.</comment>
