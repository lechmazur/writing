<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's conscience-for-hire role creates a compelling internal contradiction between professional detachment and moral awakening. The researchers' collective guilt is effectively embodied through wind chimes and physical trembling, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("moral radiation"). The final choice to return uncertainty rather than certainty is earned through accumulated pressure, with visible cost in the researchers' transformed stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught wind chime cipher building to Resonant Reconfiguration where researchers embrace "protected vulnerability of not knowing." Cost is legible in their shift from certainty to doubt, though the mechanism of Mira's transformation could be more causally traced. The hollow mirror shard functions as a consistent constraint throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting effectively pressures choices through its "honest wind" and the broken mirror that becomes the hollow shard. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-carrying breeze, fog pressing glass). The coral beds exist mostly as abstract "data points" until the mirror reveals them as "living cities," grounding the stakes effectively if late.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (moral certainty vs. ecological destruction) signals early and tightens when Mira offers the unprecedented choice. The researchers' transformation from confident certainty to "protected vulnerability" shows clear cost. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns, with the single major tightening coming late.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the wind chime cipher and hollow mirror's void-reflection, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of "protected vulnerability" resonates through action rather than assertion. The final image of humans "learning to stand in the protected vulnerability of not knowing" reweights the entire premise without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("conscience-for-hire," "moral radiation"). POV remains stable with Mira as focalizer, though some passages drift toward omniscient commentary ("the most honest position"). The wind chime translations create an effective idiolect that enriches the narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, but several abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("protected vulnerability" appears 5 times, "honest/honestly" 4 times). Some metaphors strain clarity ("moral radiation without contamination"). The wind chime cipher device adds textural specificity that partially compensates for occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire concept offers a fresh angle on moral compromise, with the wind chime cipher as an inventive mechanism for externalizing doubt. The hollow mirror shard as void-vessel is conceptually striking. However, some elements feel conceptually neat rather than viscerally grounded, particularly the transformation mechanism.</comment>
