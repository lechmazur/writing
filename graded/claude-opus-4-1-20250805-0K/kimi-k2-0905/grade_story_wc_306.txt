<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between professional detachment and emerging moral stance drives the closure effectively, with her unprecedented choice to offer truth over comfort showing earned change. The researchers' collective conscience is well-embodied through physical details like trembling hands and the "sincerely insincere" faces, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("protected vulnerability") rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the researchers standing in "the protected vulnerability of not knowing," having abandoned their certainty for honest uncertainty—clear cost in lost investor confidence implied. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of moral radiation, wind chime accumulation, and the final cadence shift to "raw music." Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the precise nature of Mira's service takes time to clarify.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively—the wind chimes' encoded messages, the observation deck's exposure to "honest wind," and the hollow mirror shard all function as micro-settings that shape perception and enable Mira's work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt breeze, fog pressing glass, wind chime tones), though some descriptions lean abstract ("atmosphere" as cloak).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the team will maintain destructive certainty or accept doubt—escalates through Mira's unprecedented offer of choice rather than comfort, forcing confrontation with "coral gardens...sentenced to death." Cost is visible in the final image of researchers learning to stand in vulnerability, their investor-ready certainty abandoned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the wind chimes' encoded doubts and the hollow mirror's void-reflection, culminating in the insight that "not knowing" is "the most honest position from which any real decision could begin." The coral beds transform from "abstract data points" to "living cities," earning the thematic weight through concrete particulars rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with purposeful compression ("conscience-for-hire whose services were booked until sunrise") and effective free indirect moments showing researchers' split consciousness. Some constructions edge toward written prose rather than natural thought ("sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability"), but rhythm modulates effectively with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments of compression and imagery ("hollow mirror shard...tunnel where reflections went to dissolve"), but suffers from repeated abstract constructions ("protected vulnerability" appears 3 times) and some template phrasing ("She'd learned that...," "This was the paradox that..."). The filter-verb stack in paragraph 11 ("seeing not his face but...") dulls immediacy at a crucial beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire concept offers a fresh angle on moral compromise, particularly the "hollow mirror shard" as vessel for unprocessed grief. The wind chimes as encoded conscience cipher shows originality, though the resolution toward accepting uncertainty over false certainty follows a somewhat familiar arc.</comment>
