<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between inherited identity and personal agency crystallizes in the choice to leave the money as territorial markers rather than keeping them. The protagonist's micro-choices (placing specific bills in specific locations) reveal values under pressure with visible cost—abandoning both father's legacy and startup equity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery until the final realization that "every circle has an exit if you stop trying to" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The incomplete final sentence effectively charges the closure moment. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some reflection-heavy passages that don't fully anchor to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned train functions as both setting and constraint, with specific details (molded fiberboard plates, holes in roof, brass trumpet) grounding each beat. The territorial markers left by others directly shape the protagonist's final choice to add their own. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stepping between cars to the dining car interior to the exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as each discovered marker deepens understanding, culminating in the choice to release the money rather than keep it. The cost is visible—abandoning both inheritances (father's collection and startup equity). Stakes could be more viscerally felt in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the circular imagery and territorial markers without explicit moralizing. The final image of notes rustling "like applause delayed by years" resonantly reweights the startup failure and father's legacy. The incomplete sentence becomes thematically essential—refusing to complete the circle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (seeing paint as "dried blood," hearing "metallic lullaby"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections slightly dulls immediacy. The perceptual signature remains consistent—someone who reads surfaces for hidden patterns and meanings.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("moonlight dripped through holes") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "polished calm"/"calm" repetitions, multiple variations on circularity. Template cadence appears in "I + verb" constructions across several consecutive sentences in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of startup failure with inherited criminality through territorial marking offers a non-obvious angle. The incomplete final sentence as structural choice shows risk-taking that heightens meaning. However, the meditation-on-failure frame follows familiar patterns without fully transforming them through lived detail.</comment>
