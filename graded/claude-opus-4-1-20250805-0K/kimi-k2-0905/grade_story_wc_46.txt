<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to share light without fire is embodied through concrete ritual actions and sensory memories, with internal conflict between isolation and connection driving her choices. The transformation from weighted absence to "fullness" at closure is earned through prior causality, though some introspective passages lean toward diagnostic clarity ("the exact mass of every night she had spent alone") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's successful sharing of stillness-light transforms both her internal state and the villagers' relationship to darkness, with visible cost in the pearl's dissolution. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building pressure through ritual repetition and sensory density toward the final image of "weighing nothing, lighting everything."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as more than setting—its calcite veins, ancient seawater, and resonant spine actively participate in the transformation ritual, constraining Lira's actions and enabling the pearl's creation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-sweet breath, emerald gloom), though the village setting remains somewhat generic beyond rooftops and fields.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sharing light without kindling fear—is signaled early and tested through the ritual's progression, with the pearl's weight-exchange creating a meaningful tightening that forecloses Lira's isolation. Cost is visible in the pearl dissolving "between her fingers" and felt in the transformation from burden to "fullness," though escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of light-without-fire as connection-without-fear, with the pearl of stillness literalizing inner calm that can be shared. The final image of Lira as "a lantern needing no wick" resonantly answers the story's question about how to bridge isolation, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("memories resurfaced not as chains but as constellations").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature through selective attention to luminous detail and weight-based metaphors, with purposeful compression in phrases like "zephyr bloom cool." Some introspective passages drift toward elevated register ("the exact heft of a sigh released after long crying") that slightly exceeds Lira's established lexicon, but rhythmic control during the ritual sequence is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dandelion seed" light shafts, "shoreline receiving tide") with strong information density in ritual passages. However, the phrase "memories resurfaced" appears three times with diminishing returns, and some constructions lean toward template cadence ("She had come to... She thought of... She felt..."). The closing image recovers momentum with integrated metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of sharing light without fire offers a fresh angle on connection and fear, with the pearl of stillness as tangible manifestation of inner calm providing specific grounding. The serpentine grotto ritual and weight-exchange mechanism feel organic to this world, though the village's generic fear of light lacks the specificity that elevates other elements.</comment>
