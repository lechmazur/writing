Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate it systematically across all categories.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to share light without fire is clearly rooted and intensifies through concrete embodied moments like "weight settle inside her chest, the exact mass of every night she had spent alone." The final choice to release the pearl shows meaningful change with visible cost ("the pearl dissolve between her fingers"), though some interiority edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira transforms from isolated star-watcher to communal light-bearer, with clear cost ("pearl dissolve between her fingers, its last weight the exact heft of a sigh released after long crying"). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation could anchor "who" slightly earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as more than setting—its "calcite veins pulse like faint heartbeats" and later becomes a mirror that enables transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt-sweet breath of tides"), and the environment constrains choices through the specific ritual space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of sharing light without fire escalates through the ritual's progression, with meaningful deepening when "the pearl's absence as fullness" reweights her relationship to darkness. Cost is visible in the pearl's dissolution and her acceptance of loss, though pressure could tighten more sharply mid-story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pearl of stillness metaphor—light without burning becomes healing without harm. The final image of Lira as "a lantern needing no wick" offers a non-literal answer to the central question, and the recurring memory motif ("memories resurfaced") gains depth through repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("three circles sunwise, one slow breath"), though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("fugitive glimmers," "zephyr bloom cool"). The perceptual signature is strong in moments like "eyes wide as lunar craters, mouth a shoreline receiving tide," but some passages edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The mist reacted, coiling tighter, weaving itself into translucent ropes"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("soft petals of luminance unfurling") and occasional register drift ("the exact mass of every night") prevent higher scoring, though no major clarity issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of sharing light without fire offers a fresh angle on healing/transformation narratives. The synthesis of astronomical observation with cave ritual creates specificity, though some metaphorical choices ("dandelion seed" for light shafts) feel less original. The pearl of stillness as transformative medium shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
