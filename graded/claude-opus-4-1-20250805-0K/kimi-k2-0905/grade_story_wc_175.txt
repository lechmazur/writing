<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral memorial-making is clear and consistent, driving specific choices like selecting the migration day and using temporary materials. Her internal experience is richly embodied through concrete gestures and perceptions rather than labels. The moth wing's discovery "caught in the gears of the town clock, a casualty of time's mechanical hunger" provides specific backstory that shapes present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's completed memorial dissolving into migration, with visible cost in her tears "though she could not say whether from loss or completion." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout as density increases toward the butterflies' spiral departure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "verdant grotto above the clouds" with "ferns suspended in sky, their roots transiently rooted in pockets of cloud-soil that would dissolve by nightfall" creates a micro-setting that constrains the memorial's temporary nature. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "each breath tasting of moss and mineral." The ephemeral setting directly shapes the choice of temporary materials and charges the final image of dissolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through temporary permanence—deepens through the butterfly's arrival as "the one whose wing she carried—the other's twin, come to claim its shadow." Escalation occurs through accumulation as more butterflies transform the memorial into "something breathing" before lifting it piece by piece. The cost is visible in the memorial's dissolution and Elara's tears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "temporary permanence" embodied in the wire memorial's dissolution into migration. The moth wing "caught in the gears of the town clock" resonates against "time's mechanical hunger" without explicit moralizing. The final image of "silver wire caught starlight, carrying its cargo of stories on wings that would never land" offers a non-literal answer to how overlooked histories achieve weightlessness through dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception filtered through Elara's esoteric realist lens. Diction like "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted," and "interrupted cadence" creates distinct texture. The narrative voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent construction to elegiac ending without head-hopping or distance breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines like "silver wire catching sunlight as it rose" doing multiple jobs. Some repetition appears ("blushing stillness" twice, multiple uses of "dissolve/dissolution") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor issues include the truncated ending and occasional elevated diction ("transiently rooted in pockets of cloud-soil") that occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central concept of honoring the overlooked through ephemeral art that must dissolve to achieve meaning offers a fresh angle on memorial-making. The specific synthesis of monarch migration, wire sculpture, and cloud-grotto creates an organic whole. The transformation of the moth wing from clock casualty to migration participant feels earned through established particulars.</comment>
