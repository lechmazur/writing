<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor overlooked histories through ephemeral memorials is consistent and drives every choice, particularly the decision to release the structure to the butterflies. The internal conflict between preservation and dissolution plays out through concrete actions (knotting wire, watching it dissolve). Minor deduction for the grandmother's wisdom arriving as convenient backstory rather than discovered through present struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's memorial achieves its purpose by dissolving into migration, with visible cost in her tears and the empty pocket. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through butterfly arrival, culminating in the spiral dissolution. Orientation anchors (grotto, dawn, migration) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto's "transiently rooted" nature in cloud-soil directly constrains the memorial's temporary existence, making setting essential to the story's logic. Vivid sensory work ("air thinned...tasting of moss and mineral") and the lightning-scarred log provide texture. The ephemeral setting enables rather than merely frames the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: single butterfly arrival → recognition of twin → swarm gathering → memorial lifting piece by piece. The cost is legible in Elara's tears and the physical dissolution of her work. Agency manifests through her deliberate construction and release rather than forced reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central image of temporary permanence—the wire cathedral that exists only in dissolution. The moth wing's journey from clock gears to butterfly migration reweights mechanical time against organic cycles. The ending avoids stating its moral, letting the image of "histories that achieved weightlessness through being forgotten" carry the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the memorial's construction. Some filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "she felt," "she thought") dulls immediacy in middle passages. Voice maintains its esoteric register throughout, though lacks a fully distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of beauty ("blushing stillness," "wire cathedral wrapped in wings"). Template cadence appears in "She had chosen...She had found...She descended" sequence. Some paraphrase loops around the temporary/transient concept. Information density is moderate; several passages could do more work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of honoring the overlooked through temporary monuments offers a fresh angle on memory and loss. Specific details (moth wing in clock gears, cloud-soil) elevate beyond generic meditation. The transformation of a damaged moth wing into butterfly migration creates non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
