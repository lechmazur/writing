<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to unlearn hatred through subtraction is clear and consistent, with her internal conflict between former harmony and current silence driving meaningful choices. The final renunciation of her voice carries genuine cost, though some interiority tends toward abstraction ("frequencies anger forgets") rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's silence becomes the city's root tone, with visible cost (rosette crumbles, voice sacrificed). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases that reweight the dominant stake of transforming hatred through subtraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its materials (rosette, books) and temporal window ("unbinding of the ear") shape Mara's method. Sensory details like "cedar and candle smoke" and "saffron, iron, river water" are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: seventeen syllables gathered, scale offered as sacrifice, city's heartbeat rearranging. The dominant stake (unlearning hatred) tightens through subtraction with visible cost at each stage, though the conflict lacks a decisive reversal or opposition that would elevate tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of vanishing arts that "wait inside negative space," with the final image of children humming the same scale offering a non-literal answer to how hatred dissolves. The rosette's transformation and Mara's silence becoming the city's root tone create resonant meaning without stated morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "traveled stillness" and selective attention to sound/silence, though prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fundamental held so steadily"). Some syntactic monotony in middle sections with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but template cadence appears in sequences like "She walked...She returned...She understood." Register drift into abstract philosophizing ("vanishing arts do not disappear; they wait inside negative space") dulls immediacy in places, though the closure image remains vivid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of unlearning hatred through sonic subtraction rather than addition offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. The specific synthesis of musical expertise with silence as active force feels earned, though some elements (velvet library, autumn equinox) lean toward familiar atmospheric choices.</comment>
