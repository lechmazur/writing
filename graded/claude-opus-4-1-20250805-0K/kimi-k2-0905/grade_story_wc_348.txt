<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven motivation to transform absence into presence is consistent and compelling throughout. Her internal conflict between scientific control and emotional loss manifests in concrete actions (creating the sculptures, returning to the ravine). The final choice to leave the sculptures for others shows genuine character movement with visible cost—releasing control of her sister's memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through the braiding motif (water, polymer chains, memory). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara transforms personal grief into communal experience, with clear cost in letting go. The progression from receiving the letter to creating and releasing the sculptures maintains causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The braided ravine functions as more than setting—it inspires Mara's polymer solution and hosts the final installation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (water dividing/reuniting, chrysalis catching light). The environment constrains choice when wind steals the ashes, forcing Mara to find another way to honor her sister.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into connection—escalates from personal (scattering ashes) through scientific (creating the resin) to communal (sharing the sculptures). The wind stealing the ashes creates meaningful pressure that forces innovation. Cost is visible when Mara walks away, leaving her creation for strangers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The braiding metaphor elegantly unifies water, polymers, and human connection without explicit moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete action as separation literally becomes connection via the sculptures. The final image of strangers experiencing the installation offers a non-literal answer to loss—grief shared rather than held.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with scientific precision coloring perception ("440 hertz, concert pitch"). Some filter verb accumulation ("she saw," "she heard") slightly dulls immediacy. Voice distinctly reflects a polymer chemist's analytical mindset, though occasional overwriting ("fossilized moonlight") strains against the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("grief itself had pupated and hatched too late"). However, some overwrought metaphors accumulate ("ear nested in her chest," "moonlight loosens its grip") and occasional template phrasing appears ("Behind her," "By dawn"). The scientific terminology reads authentic but dense figurative language in places reduces clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer chemistry with grief processing offers fresh specificity—using material science to solve emotional problems. The sculptures that transmit laughter through bone vibration present an original image. Risk-taking in the extended metaphor system mostly succeeds, though density occasionally obscures.</comment>
