<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven transformation from guilt to creative action is well-motivated through concrete choices (refusing the call, creating the sculptures). Internal contradiction between scientific precision and emotional chaos effectively drives the arc. The cost of her sister's absence is embodied through physical actions and sensory details rather than emotional labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern-teaching via the braided water imagery that mirrors polymer chains and emotional connection. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara transforms absence into "bridges stronger than the original loss" with clear emotional cost. The pieces literally and figuratively "fall into place" as she moves from isolation to creating communal healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ravine functions as both setting and metaphor, constraining Mara's choices (where to scatter ashes) and enabling her insight about polymer architecture. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered through her chemist's lens. The chrysalis and water patterns actively shape her scientific solution, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief into connection) escalates from personal loss through scientific insight to communal healing. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes the chrysalis is "not empty; it was a mold," foreclosing passive grief for active creation. Cost is visible in her "loosened grief slipping down her cheeks" and the permanence of placing sculptures she'll never retrieve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of braiding—water dividing/reuniting, polymer chains, separation/connection—without explicit moralizing. The final image of "polymers of memory...rewoven into bridges" offers a non-literal answer to loss. Subtext operates through scientific process standing in for emotional processing, with the 440 hertz detail carrying sister-specific resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register with distinctive perceptual signature (seeing emotional patterns through polymer chemistry lens). Some moments of elevated diction ("symphonically minded," "fossilized moonlight") slightly strain the established register. POV control is strong with no head-hopping, though occasional phrases like "proof that polymers of memory" edge toward authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with most lines serving multiple functions. Some figurative density in peak moments ("fossilized moonlight," "ear nested in her chest") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" structures. Final paragraph contains slight register drift with "performed—proof that" construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer chemistry with grief processing offers fresh specificity, avoiding generic loss narratives. The sculptures as embodied memory that strangers can physically feel is inventive. Risk-taking in the extended metaphor system pays off, though some elements (symphonic butterflies) feel slightly forced.</comment>
