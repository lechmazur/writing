<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between confidence and uncertainty drives genuine choices throughout, particularly in her decision to edit the filaments despite knowing each change propagates echoes. The embodied emotion of the pen vibrating and gravity tugging at her bones avoids stock interiority. Her final acceptance of "confident in its gentle uncertainty" represents earned character growth through specific struggle, though some moments edge toward abstract philosophizing rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira accepts uncertainty as "the truest coordinate" with visible cost (the propagating echoes she must meet). The causal chain from planting wrong seeds to garbled signals to editing history holds, though the exact mechanics of "unbending events" remain somewhat abstract. Orientation anchors (station, Mira's role, the anomaly) establish by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as active setting that constrains choice—it twists light-cones, affects Mira's body, and enables the editing of history. Sensory details like "recycled air and regret" and the warmth rising through boot soles ground the fantastical elements. The station environment shapes tactics throughout, though some descriptions lean toward the conceptual rather than the tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—correcting the communication error while accepting uncertainty—develops through one meaningful deepening as Mira shifts from trying to fix her mistake to embracing uncertainty as necessary. Cost appears in the "propagated echoes" she knows she'll face and the energy borrowed from the station. The escalation feels more textural than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of uncertainty as truth emerges organically through Mira's actions and the story's imagery, particularly the dried pen writing absence and the "confident uncertainty" paradox. The final image of walking where "gravity still stuttered" offers a non-literal answer to whether certainty or uncertainty guides us. The mentor's gardening metaphor about pruning wrong branches enriches without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The close third-person POV maintains consistent access to Mira's perception with distinctive touches like "polite but insistent child" for gravity and "contingency" as what flows instead of ink. The lyrical register suits the conceptual work without becoming opaque. No dialogue appears, appropriately for this introspective piece, and the voice modulates effectively during the editing sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the editing sequence where shorter sentences build tension. Some conceptual redundancy appears ("confident uncertainty"/"confidently uncertain" repeats the paradox), and occasional abstract phrasing ("meaning threshed from the husk of error") borders on purple prose. Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of editing history through "contingent relationships" and naming filaments offers a fresh angle on time-manipulation stories. The specific synthesis of signal interpretation, quantum uncertainty, and emotional gardening creates an original framework. The dried pen that writes absence despite having no ink provides a memorable image, though some elements feel designed to showcase conceptual cleverness.</comment>
