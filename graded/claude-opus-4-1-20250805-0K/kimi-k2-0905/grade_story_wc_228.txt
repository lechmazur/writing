<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ren's journey from artistic loss to acceptance is driven by consistent internal contradiction between preserving and releasing, with the final choice to hide his work earning its cost through prior causality. The "intimately aloof" quality manifests in concrete actions throughout. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle sections ("temporary eternity" as concept rather than embodied state).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror crack catalyzing a journey where each discovery deepens meaning, culminating in Ren's act of preservation that reweights loss as continuity. The closure (placing shell and canvas in the cave) lands with clear cost—abandoning public recognition for private permanence. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the who/where/when.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cave network functions as more than setting—it constrains choices (darkness, thinning air) and enables the final preservation act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("gulls screamed like circular saws"). The painted shell discovery charges the final image perfectly. Minor deduction for some generic coastal descriptors early on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the quay's memory) escalates from failed painting to discovering the shell's impossible mural to choosing hidden preservation over public display. Cost is visible in Ren's acceptance of anonymity. The accumulative pressure builds well but lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shell-within-shell structure: art's permanence requires accepting invisibility. The "temporary eternity" paradox resolves through Ren's final act without stating its meaning. The painted figure being himself "perpetually arriving, perpetually leaving" is particularly resonant. Strong avoidance of explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with selective perception ("intimately aloof from the man who once believed") and consistent psychic distance. Some elevated diction fits the artistic POV but occasionally drifts toward writerly rather than lived ("the perfume of departure"). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor syntactic monotony in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("gulls screamed like circular saws eating the sky"). However, several instances of elevated register that feel performed rather than natural ("cathedral veins," "negotiating with the land"). Some paraphrase loops around the preservation theme. Information density is good but uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The nested structure of painted shell containing painted canvas offers fresh perspective on artistic legacy. The inversion of public/private value and the self-portrait as eternal arrival/departure show genuine ingenuity. Transformation of the "failed artist" trope through acceptance rather than triumph adds originality.</comment>
