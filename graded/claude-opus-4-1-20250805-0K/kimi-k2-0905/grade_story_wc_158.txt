<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zale's centuries of insomnia creates a compelling internal contradiction between exhaustion and purpose, with the final choice to sleep reading as genuine renunciation with visible cost. The transition from "hollowing blade" exhaustion to accepting sleep as "alliance" shows earned character change. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("centuries of longing condensed into dew") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Zale's planting of the postcard transforms the cathedral into a living armistice-maker, with clear cost (centuries of longing photosynthesized). The pattern of spiral/shell/nautilus imagery coheres throughout, and the final image of children planting cherry pits without knowing they're "growing armistices" delivers resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nautilus cathedral functions as both setting and constraint, with the spiral architecture mirroring the story's recursive structure. The "hollow pearl large enough for two heartbeats" chamber and limestone that "drank his voice" create vivid spatial specificity. The setting actively shapes Zale's final choice through the bioluminescent transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Zale moves from listening to the lullaby, touching the dew-droplets of memory, reading the postcard's hidden message, to finally planting it. The cost is legible when he leaves "centuries of longing stayed behind" to photosynthesize. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming accumulated pain into beauty emerges organically through the blossom armistice concept and Zale's action of planting the postcard. The final image of children unknowingly "growing armistices" offers a non-literal answer to how wars end before they begin. Strong integration without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") and controlled lyric register throughout. Some register elevation in peak moments ("photosynthesizing inside the shell, converting every sleepless hour") strains against accessibility but remains purposeful. The perceptual signature of an exhausted poet viewing time in centuries holds consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "centuries of longing" appears four times with minimal variation. Template cadence in middle section ("He touched... He understood... He peeled...") creates mechanical rhythm. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but accumulates enough minor artifacts to prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of war/peace through botanical metaphor (cherry pits as bullets, photosynthesis as transformation) feels fresh and specific. The "galaxy postcard" mailed through collapsed postal stars offers an original angle on intergenerational communication. The concept of insomnia as generational vigil transforms a familiar condition into something mythic.</comment>
