I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zale's centuries of insomnia creates a compelling internal contradiction between exhaustion and vigilance, with his final choice to sleep carrying genuine cost. The moment where he "smiled in his sleep, having ensconced centuries of longing where they could blossom" shows earned transformation through accumulated experience, though some interior passages lean toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Zale's transformation of accumulated insomnia into a generative force, with clear cost (centuries of sleeplessness finally released). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building density through layered temporal imagery until the final photosynthesize moment reweights all prior suffering. Minor orientation wobble in the middle third with the droplet-planetarium sequence slightly delays anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nautilus cathedral functions as both setting and constraint, with the spiral architecture mirroring the story's recursive structure. The limestone drinking and returning Zale's voice multiplied creates a vivid sense of accumulated time, and the shell becoming "a bioluminescent throat" directly enables the closure transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation rather than reversal: from listening to climbing to reading to planting, each action deepens Zale's engagement with centuries of longing. The cost is legible when he leaves his centuries behind to photosynthesize, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition testing his resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central theme of transforming accumulated pain into beauty emerges organically through the blossom armistice image and culminates in the photosynthesize metaphor without explicit moralizing. The final image of children unknowingly planting armistices offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature of an insomniac poet filtering centuries of experience comes through clearly, though occasional register elevation ("ensconced centuries of longing") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with images doing multiple jobs (the shell as cathedral/throat/time-keeper), but several instances of paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "centuries of longing" appears four times with minimal variation. The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("Sleep pressed against his eyelids, not as surrender but as alliance") but occasionally drifts into abstract territory that reduces propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of war memory, botanical transformation, and astronomical imagery creates a genuinely fresh premise executed with commitment. The concept of poets across time mailing galaxy postcards forward as peace treaties shows bold originality, and the risk of the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band for risk distinction).</comment>
