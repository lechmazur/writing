<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's transformation from darkness to silent teacher is earned through specific embodied details (mouthless face, gloved hands warming the mirror). Internal contradiction manifests concretely as she holds both the half-spoken secret and enforced silence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "spiralingly calm presence" that reads more as label than embodied state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing through Conceptual Repricing—darkness discovers it's "made of the same substance" as stars. The pattern-teaching with shutters accumulates toward this realization with visible cost (her lost voice, eternal vigil). Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the who/what.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dental mirror and shutter-patterns constrain choices and charge the final image effectively. Sensory detail is selective (cobalt dock, bruised sky colors) and filtered through the guardian's unique perception. Deduction for some abstract descriptions ("patterns of light and shadow that wove across the wet cobblestones like a code") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching darkness to value stars—progresses through accumulating pattern-work with shutters, deepening as darkness learns to hold light "without being destroyed." Cost is visible in her lost voice and eternal repetition. Missing a sharper tightening moment where options narrow dramatically, though the accumulative design doesn't require reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of teaching via absence and reflection. The final insight that darkness and stars share the same substance reweights all prior material without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the "half-spoken secret" that never needs explicit articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with the guardian's selective attention to light patterns and silence. Some elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "negative space between shutter-slats") occasionally drifts from the established register. No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the premise of enforced silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("She had been here since..." followed by three "since" clauses; darkness described redundantly as "not evil but lonely, not hungry but empty"). Template cadence appears in multiple "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is moderate but could be tighter—some passages restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dental mirror as a tool for teaching darkness is unexpected and specific. The transformation of a medical instrument into a spiritual teaching device shows originality. However, the guardian-figure and light/dark dichotomy are familiar territory not fully transformed through unique particulars.</comment>
