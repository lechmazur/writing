<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's mute empathy and internal contradiction between past failure and present purpose drive meaningful choices, particularly in the weaving sequence where her tears acknowledge the drowned child while teaching darkness. The final renunciation (walking away, leaving the taught darkness to perpetuate itself) carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—darkness learns to cradle starlight, reweighting its nature from "mere eraser of day" to protective vessel. Cost is legible in "tears, soundless as everything else she did" connecting the drowned child to this act of teaching. The pattern accumulates through weaving, mirror work, and the final gift of understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, dental mirror angles, and shutter lattice constrain how the guardian must work—she can only teach through reflected light and silence. The canal itself embodies "drowned footsteps and cargo," making the setting inseparable from the guardian's loss and current purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from teaching darkness to confronting personal trauma when "she saw in that tender carriage the child she had failed to save." The escalation through careful light-weaving to darkness's recognition to the guardian's tears creates meaningful pressure with visible cost in her departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending reweights darkness from absence to presence—"even the blackest channel once learned the value of stars"—without stating a moral. The theme emerges through concrete acts of silent teaching, with the dental mirror as a tool of transformation rather than correction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in "spiralingly calm" and controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("coat spreading like a dark wing"). The POV maintains consistent interiority despite the guardian's muteness, using embodied perception effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in places: "tears, soundless as everything else she did" could be "soundless tears." Some metaphor density in peak beats ("coat swaying like a bell that could not ring") without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly in the "She [verb]" pattern mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of teaching darkness empathy through light-weaving is genuinely fresh, avoiding expected confrontation for quiet transformation. The specific synthesis of muteness, light-craft, and teaching rather than banishing darkness feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
