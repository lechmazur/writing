<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation to preserve defiance is embodied through concrete actions (planting seeds, evading Inspector Voss) with clear stakes. His charming scholar persona manifests in specific tactics—reciting Lucretius as both deflection and activation code. The internal tension between compliance ("making sure none escape untaxed") and rebellion drives authentic micro-choices, though some interiority leans toward explanatory rather than contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear closure: Arlo successfully plants the first seed and escapes to continue his mission, with seven gardens blooming by sunrise as Conceptual Repricing. The thought-tax worldbuilding anchors immediately and constrains all subsequent action. Minor orientation wobble around the "warp" mechanics slightly dulls mid-story clarity but doesn't break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choices—surveillance drones overhead, Inspector Voss's arrival forcing immediate action, hidden speakers enabling escape. Sensory details (orchid bees droning "like tiny tax auditors") filter through Arlo's rebellious POV. The planted seed transforming into readable vine charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving defiance against thought taxation) established early and tested through Voss's arrival, forcing Arlo to choose between capture and mission completion. The escape using pollen distraction meaningfully tightens options. Cost is more projected (future blooming) than immediately felt, keeping this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of untaxed thoughts as rebellion, with the final image of citizens feeling "an untaxed thought unfurl" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The secret language club's vegetal code creates effective subtext. Slight tendency toward thematic convenience with the perfectly timed pollen release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combining scholarly diction ("candidly cryptic," "Lucretius") with rebellious energy. POV control mostly strong, though brief omniscient slip in final paragraph ("every citizen walking past would feel"). Dialogue between Arlo and Voss carries effective subtext of cat-and-mouse tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid moments ("moonlight taxed itself for the privilege of existing"). Some template cadence in middle sections ("Arlo replied...The answer came...He exhaled") and filter-verb clustering around perception. Overreliance on participial phrases creates simultaneity confusion in action sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian thought-control with guerrilla gardening creates memorable premise. The vegetal communication code and specific worldbuilding details (Form 1099-IDEA) transform familiar rebellion tropes. Risk-taking in the conceptual blend heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
