<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—planting seeds as rebellion against thought taxation—with internal contradiction between his charming facade and genuine defiance. The final choice to gift "untaxed thoughts" carries visible cost (risk of capture/taxation), though some interior phrasing edges toward diagnostic ("converging chaos pressurized"). Minor deduction for "candidly cryptic" appearing as a repeated label rather than fully embodied trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Arlo plants seed → Voss arrives → escape enables completion of seven-garden network → citizens receive "untaxed thoughts." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (Arlo's risk/exposure), though the final paragraph tells rather than shows the dawn outcome. The "warp" mechanism strains credibility but maintains internal consistency. Orientation anchors cleanly (greenhouse, after thought-taxation).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting directly constrains choices (hidden speakers, pollen clouds enable escape), with sensory detail filtering through Arlo's priorities ("orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rows to exit gate. The seed-in-soil "warp" that opens a "green comma" provides micro-setting functionality, though the mechanism lacks grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving mental freedom) escalates through Voss's arrival forcing immediate action under surveillance threat. The tightening—one minute until satellite detection—narrows options and drives Arlo's escape. Cost appears in risk taken and "lighter by one" seed pouch, though the ease of escape via pollen clouds reduces tension at the critical moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of resistance against authoritarian control emerges through concrete details (Form 1099-IDEA, surveillance drones) rather than abstract statements. The "green comma rewriting reality" and firefly-readable resistance message work as non-literal answers to freedom's value. However, the final paragraph's exposition ("Arlo's gift, the charming rogue scholar's ransom for freedom") edges toward explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled whimsy ("orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors") and consistent perceptual signature filtering the dystopian world through scholarly wit. Dialogue between Arlo and Voss carries effective subtext through their "candidly cryptic" exchange. Minor repetition of "charming rogue scholar" as epithet rather than integrated description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression ("He sprinted down alleys where moonlight taxed itself"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template repetition ("candidly cryptic" 3x, "charming rogue scholar" 3x) and the final paragraph's summary-heavy telling that deflates momentum rather than sustaining the escapade's energy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian thought-control with botanical resistance creates memorable specificity. The detail of "Form 1099-IDEA" and bees as "tiny tax auditors" transforms familiar surveillance tropes through accounting metaphor. Risk-taking in the vegetal communication system and "warp" mechanics, though the magical realism element isn't fully grounded in the world's logic.</comment>
