<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Posy's motivation to preserve memory through bottled sounds is concrete and embodied through specific actions, with internal contradiction between hope and the weight of history. The child's request creates genuine pressure that forces Posy to act beyond her capabilities, culminating in a choice with visible cost. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in the resolution where complex grief transforms too cleanly into communal harmony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the music box's transformation from sealed relic to projective bridge, with clear cost in Posy's years of patient collecting. The accumulative lens holds consistently as density increases through layered sounds until the final "We are still becoming" reweights the entire preservation project. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words with clear who/where/when.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ship's hull beneath dunes creates a liminal space that shapes Posy's choices—the architecture of "salt-bleached arches" becoming a cathedral for memory work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (apricot salt, kelp-stitched blankets), filtered through Posy's preservationist lens. The setting constrains through scarcity (three pennies) and enables through found materials (glass jars from tide-miles), directly charging the final communal hum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving generational memory before it dissolves—intensifies when the child requests an impossible recording, forcing Posy to risk opening the sealed music box. This tightening forecloses her patient waiting and creates visible cost through the irreversible act of emptying all collected sounds. The resolution is earned through Posy's accumulated work, though the final transformation arrives slightly too smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of bottling ephemeral sounds, with the music box's final projection "We are still becoming" offering a non-literal answer about memory's ongoing transformation. The piece resists simple preservation-versus-progress binaries, embracing complexity through Posy's practice of offering memory freely "like a coat to the shivering." Subtext operates effectively in the child's return with "copper seeds," suggesting regeneration rather than mere archival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through compound constructions ("kelp-stitched," "rose-gold") and musical phrasing that mirrors Posy's poet identity. The perceptual signature is highly specific—she notices sounds others ignore, experiences architecture as music ("played the feral loft...like a flute"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close for the intimate jar-opening ritual while maintaining lyric elevation for descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"bones humming with the lonesome splendor" establishes both physical state and emotional tenor. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the jar-emptying sequence through shorter, list-like phrases. Minor deduction for occasional overwrought metaphor ("brushed her ribs like a cat asking to be named") that slightly dulls momentum without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of memory preservation through bottled sounds offers genuine freshness, synthesizing refugee narrative with synaesthetic archival practice. The story commits fully to its premise, following implications through to the holographic projection that transforms private collection into communal resonance. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the non-literal resolution heightens stakes while maintaining clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
