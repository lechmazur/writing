<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prosopagnosia creates a compelling internal contradiction where the artist cannot recognize faces but renders them with mathematical precision, driving her unique perception of "negative space between people." The final realization that she's been painting her own face through absence shows earned character insight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "essential architecture of human presence" that edges toward diagnostic language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the Conceptual Repricing where the artist realizes "the guild's greatest knowledge was never in books but in choosing those who could see beyond seeing." The coin's indentations → painting methodology → preservation of memory creates coherent linkage. Cost is conceptual but legible in the loss of sanctuary and the artist's acceptance of her limitation as gift. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the condemned building context.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library with "curved shelves of living wood" and the knothole window create vivid, constraining space that shapes the artist's final work. Sensory detail effectively narrows during urgency—the candle flame dancing across wet paint as charges are set. The coin's physical indentations directly guide the painting's measurements, making setting instrumental to action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulating time pressure (demolition countdown) forcing faster painting while maintaining fractal precision. The discovery of the coin's code creates a meaningful deepening that changes her understanding from painting faces to painting "sky-shaped absence." Cost is felt in leaving behind her only sanctuary, though the external demolition threat could have more directly tested her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of blindness enabling true sight—"without faces, she sees the essential architecture of human presence." The final image of the painted sky as "a fractally precise map of human limitation" resonates without stating a moral. The coin's return to the book safe, "its indentations now doubled: original and painted," creates layered meaning about preservation through transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization throughout. Prose rhythm effectively modulates with urgency—shorter, more urgent sentences during the demolition countdown. Some elevated diction ("fractally precise," "prosopagnosia") fits the scholarly setting but occasionally creates distance. The perceptual signature of experiencing the world through touch and negative space is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple elements. Deductions for repetitive use of "fractally precise" (3x) and some abstract phrasing that edges toward philosophy-speak ("essential architecture of human presence," "temporary drama of human expression"). The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a face-blind portrait artist who paints through mathematical precision and touch offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of limitation-as-gift with the preservation of knowledge through art transformation avoids expected routes. The specific detail of using coin indentations to measure sky creates memorable particularity beyond surface cleverness.</comment>
