<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The face-blind artist's prosopagnosia creates authentic internal contradiction—she cannot recognize faces but paints them with mathematical precision, a paradox that drives meaningful choices. Her final understanding that "limitation is not failure but filter" arrives through concrete action (painting the sky as negative space between people) rather than epiphany. The artist's micro-choices under demolition pressure reveal clear values: preserving the guild's acceptance over self-preservation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the coin's indentations becoming both guide and archive. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she realizes she's been "painting her own face after all—not as it appears but as it exists in negative space," with visible cost in leaving her work behind. Orientation anchors clearly (artist, tree-trunk library, demolition imminent), though the guild's historical significance emerges late without enhancing closure pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library constrains choices—its curved walls dictate painting surface, the knothole window frames her last glimpse of sky, and the hidden book safe provides the coin that guides her work. Sensory selection reflects the artist's priorities: tactile emphasis on the coin's indentations over visual details she cannot process. The demolition's vibrations making "the candle flame dance across her wet paint" integrates setting into action effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The demolition countdown creates coherent time pressure that forces faster painting, but the artist's agency remains primarily observational until the final choice to leave. The dominant stake—preserving the sky's memory before destruction—deepens when she discovers the coin's code, though this arrives late without earlier tactical shifts. Cost becomes visible when she walks out "carrying nothing but her brushes," abandoning her final work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete paradox of seeing "beyond seeing"—the artist's face-blindness becomes a metaphor for how "wisdom begins with admitting what we cannot know." The coin's indentations creating "a braille of stars that future fingers might read" layers meaning without explicit statement. The final image of her painted sky "glowing softly in the candle's final flicker" offers resonant closure to the question of what endures beyond recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the artist experiences the world through touch ("cold copper"), mathematical patterns ("fractally precise strokes"), and negative space rather than faces. Voice modulates effectively under pressure—contemplative precision gives way to urgency: "She works faster now." The prose maintains the artist's selective attention throughout, never claiming knowledge of faces she cannot perceive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density high: "Her brush, sable and steel, moves across the curved inner wall of the trunk" simultaneously establishes tool, action, and spatial constraint. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("the sky-shaped absence that holds them together") serves the face-blind perspective. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She understands... She mixes... She works") but recovers for closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of face-blindness with portrait artistry creates genuine paradox that drives the entire piece—not quirky but essential. The concept that someone who cannot recognize faces might best preserve "the essential architecture of human presence" feels earned through specific execution. The fractally precise painting method and the coin's constellation pattern add technical originality without mere ornament.</comment>
