I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density increase and pattern accumulation toward a conceptual repricing where certainty dissolves into curiosity.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal transformation from methodical certainty to embracing curiosity is earned through concrete magical-realist events, with contradictory impulses acting in scene (frustration with stones, attraction to the nickel). The nested multiplication creates embodied confusion rather than told emotion. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the middle third ("curiosity the way lungs need air") that briefly shifts from embodied to conceptual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Liora's dissolution into multiplicity reweights the entire premise - restoration becomes perpetual questioning. The nested folding mechanism and the nickel's bargain create clear accumulative pressure. Cost is legible in her loss of singular certainty ("edges soften; she was simultaneously kneeling, walking, and yet unborn"). Minor deduction for density that occasionally obscures precise causality in the middle folding sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active constraint - tuned basalt slabs, reflecting ribbons of sound, and folding geometry all shape Liora's choices. Strong sensory integration (chiming footsteps, silver ribbon wrapping wrists, grass ringing like glass). The garden's physical properties directly enable the transformation. Slight deduction for occasional over-density in description that momentarily slows momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from restoring a single mosaic to understanding she IS the city's restoration process. The nickel's bargain creates clear cost - trading certainty for curiosity. Pressure coheres through the accumulative folding that forces Liora to confront her multiplicities. Minor deduction because the middle folding sequence, while conceptually rich, slightly diffuses immediate pressure before reconverging.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the restoration-as-questioning metaphor without explicit moralizing. The ending's "exchange is never done" resonates through accumulated particulars. The nickel as "coinage of attention" and the city dreaming its restorers create layered meaning. Strong subtext in the child's question framing the entire piece. Slight deduction for one instance of mild abstraction ("curiosity the way lungs need air").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled magical-realist register maintaining consistency through escalating surrealism. Strong perceptual signature in how Liora notices restoration details (rabbit-skin glue, tesserae, pigment). Clean focalization despite reality-bending events. Minor deduction for occasional density that slightly obscures immediate clarity, though this serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("hobo nickel," "rabbit-skin glue," "tesserae"). Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some register elevation in peak beats ("coinage of attention," "nested inside one another") creates mild distance. Template cadence appears briefly in the three awakenings sequence. No major artifacts but occasional over-density slows momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of restoration craft with metaphysical questioning creates non-obvious angle. The hobo nickel as transformative agent and the nested multiplication mechanism feel original. Risk-taking in the reality-folding sequence heightens stakes while maintaining coherence. The specific detail of restoration technique grounds the surreal elements. Within-band bonus (+0.3) for bold structural choices that enhance rather than obscure meaning.</comment>
