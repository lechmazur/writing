<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emil's moral conflict between duty and justice drives authentic choices, particularly his decision to leak evidence despite having to witness the execution. His motivation is concrete and embodied through the music box repair metaphor. Internal contradiction plays out in scene as he struggles between institutional role and personal conviction, with visible cost in using chapel funds for life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Emil accepts he must still witness the execution but has acted on truth, with visible cost in misappropriating chapel funds. The causal chain from music box repair to evidence leak to journalist is clear. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. Cost is legible in "knowing he still had to stand beside the gurney, but now also beside truth."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair shop setting constrains choice through its tools (sailor's chronometer spring) and atmosphere enables the central metaphor of mechanical redemption. Sensory details like "brass gears ticked with vibrant hush" and "dust motes floated like slow constellations" are selective and purposeful. The music box's fragile lullaby charging the final moments shows setting shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from repairing a music box to exposing judicial error, with Emil's choice forcing trade-off between institutional duty and moral action. The tightening occurs when Olya states "I can give it beat but I cannot give it mercy," forcing Emil to act beyond mechanical repair. Cost is visible in using chapel funds meant for illumination.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mechanical/organic metaphor without stating its moral, as "time forgive itself before we refuse to." The clockwork heart becomes a resonant image for second chances that constrains choices. The ending reweights earlier material as music spills onto the street, suggesting salvation through granting "the world a second opinion before the final tick."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled diction ("vibrant hush," "aptly deliberate") maintains consistency. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, as Olya's "A pulse can be coaxed, Chaplain, but the song it plays may not forgive you" works on multiple levels. Some elevated diction ("slow constellations") occasionally strains but serves the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, like "Emil paid with the chapel candle fund, money aptly deliberate, illuminating nothing if not spent on life." Minor repetition of "vibrant hush" and "aptly deliberate" creates pattern but risks becoming mannered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mechanical repair and moral redemption offers fresh angle on the death penalty narrative. Specific details like the warden's heirloom ballerina and sailor's chronometer create particularity. The transformation of apology into action through mechanical metaphor avoids abstraction, though the innocent-man-on-death-row frame is familiar.</comment>
