<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's systematic sacrifice of memories for each name creates genuine internal conflict with embodied cost. The foxglove heart metaphor and glass-orchid imagery provide consistent character-specific perception. Her final choice to sacrifice herself emerges naturally from established traits, though some emotional transitions could be more granular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with density increasing toward Lira's transformation into light. Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira becomes the final extinct feeling, with visible cost in her erasure. The child finding the tube and spreading her note worldwide completes the thematic circuit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal library, museum of extinct feelings, and cities of uncried tears create a unique metaphysical landscape that constrains choices. Glass-orchid petals function as tools that enable the preservation ritual. Setting details like "fossilized sighs" and emotion-labeled drawers directly shape Lira's tactics, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from saving names to sacrificing memories to ultimately sacrificing self, with each trade-off forcing harder choices. The chandelier's demand for payment creates persistent pressure that narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in Lira's hollowing into translucence and final erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The final image of the child learning music from Lira's essence offers a non-literal answer about preservation requiring sacrifice. Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the cracked tube becoming a mouth, names as vibrations, memory as currency. The story resists simple morals about loss, embracing the paradox that the caretaker must become extinct to preserve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistency with inventive compounds like "glass-orchid," "tear-cities," and "foxglove regret." Some passages lean heavily on abstract metaphor ("colorless breath between diaphragms of sky") that occasionally obscures immediacy. The perceptual signature is distinct but sometimes prioritizes beauty over clarity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with phrases doing multiple jobs, though figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Some metaphor vehicles strain logic ("museums of extinct feelings" as physical space). Information density is strong but occasionally tips into ornamental description that slows momentum in middle passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conceit of a museum preserving extinct feelings through sound is genuinely original. The systematic trade of memories for names, culminating in self-erasure that paradoxically ensures continuation, feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking in the metaphysical world-building heightens rather than obscures the emotional stakes.</comment>
