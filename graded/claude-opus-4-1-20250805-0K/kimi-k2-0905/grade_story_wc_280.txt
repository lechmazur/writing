<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is clear and builds from his need for applause to possibility, with embodied emotion in pressing the coin "to where his heart once beat." Internal conflict manifests through his interactions with fractured time and Lila. The final choice to carry "an endless encore beneath his translucent ribs" represents earned acceptance with visible cost—he remains invisible yet satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens governs as sensory echoes and temporal fragments layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost achieves his encore through accepting invisibility. The closure lands with felt cost as he becomes "invisible yet satisfied," carrying possibility internally rather than seeking external validation. The fractured timeline mechanics are taught early and pay off when "every performance was happening at once."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice through the maze that "rearranged itself" and the orchard that "existed only because enough mourners had remembered it simultaneously." Synesthetic details like "chords of perfume that sounded...like distant violins" create a reality where sensory boundaries dissolve. The tarot coin's "forbidden flavor" and the thread that "vibrate[s] with every curtain call" charge the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking applause to "craving possibility" to accepting internal satisfaction. The ghost's agency drives the progression through flipping the coin, catching the thread, and walking the stage to intertwine echoes. Cost is visible when his "outline sharpened into the young actor who had first died for an encore," showing transformation requires confronting his original death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of performance/authenticity and external/internal validation without explicit moralizing. The ending reweights earlier material as the ghost's "endless encore" becomes internal rather than requiring an audience. Lila's advice to "lure it from the brink of despair the way we used to lure full houses" connects artistry to making others "feel time is a song they almost remember."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled synesthetic perception throughout ("citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret"). Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to intimate interiority. Lila's dialogue carries distinct register with "Still craving applause, Casper?" and her voice "lilting like a trumpet solo he could see as gold spirals."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines like "fractured timeline obeyed, folding so that 1923 and tonight touched at the fingertips." Figurative language serves the synesthetic premise without overwriting. Minor template cadence appears in "He mounted...He bowed...He pocketed" sequence but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synesthetic ghost theater premise offers genuine freshness, with time as ribbons of colored emotion and a garden existing through collective memory. The transformation of seeking external applause to carrying internal satisfaction provides non-obvious resolution. Risk-taking through layered temporal mechanics and sensory crossings heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
