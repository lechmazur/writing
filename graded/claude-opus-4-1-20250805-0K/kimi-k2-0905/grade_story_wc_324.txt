<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with Mira's specific gift and genuine internal conflict between duty and connection. The motivation is clear and rooted in her "persistently curious nature," with embodied emotion through the hearing aid's pulses. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("tears falling in the same rhythm") rather than fully embodied response at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the photograph bridges two women, with Eleanor's heart "finally at rest" - visible emotional cost paid. The causal chain from photograph arrival to atrium visit to reunion is clean. Slight deduction for the abrupt final line cut-off that weakens the closure's full resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium transforms beautifully from mist-clad memorial to revealed carousel, constraining and enabling the story's resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted of iron and lilies"). The hearing aid functions as effective micro-setting that shapes choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to fulfilling a decades-old promise with clear emotional cost. The pressure builds through pulse-tracking to name-finding to the climactic meeting. Agency manifests through Mira's choice to deliver the message despite her limited role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "incidental heroism" - Mira doing what others cannot simply by showing up and listening. The carousel image reweights from frozen childhood joy to completed circle of connection. Minor deduction for slightly explicit framing of theme in narrative commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic precision ("mist-clad atrium at twilight swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match Mira's grounded character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and high information density. Several memorable lines achieve genuine lyricism. Deductions for repetitive "the woman" construction in closing beats and the awkwardly truncated final line that disrupts momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh concept of contact tracing for the dead through heartbeat pulses via hearing aids. The transformation of grief counseling into supernatural communication offers genuine originality. The specific detail of scalloped photograph edges and "penny candy and chlorine" memories elevates beyond template.</comment>
