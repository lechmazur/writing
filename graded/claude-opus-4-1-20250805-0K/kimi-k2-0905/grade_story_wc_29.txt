I'll evaluate this story under a Causal drive lens, as the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to action to resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by intellectual curiosity evolving to protective responsibility. The internal conflict between fear and duty manifests concretely during the broadcast sequence. However, characterization relies heavily on exposition rather than embodied emotion, and the "cautiously hopeful" attribute appears only as a label without constraining choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Mara's successful broadcast causing the entities to retreat (Decisive Change), but the cost remains abstract—we're told she's their "permanent enemy" without seeing what this means. The causal chain holds but feels mechanical, with key revelations (Professor Haskins' notes, the entities' weakness) appearing conveniently. The orientation is clear early, preventing lower scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The radio station setting provides functional constraint for the broadcast solution, and astronomical charts recur as both decoration and plot device. However, sensory detail is sparse, focusing almost entirely on abstract concepts rather than lived-in specificity. The university setting exists mainly as a label.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal discovery to humanity's survival, with armed militias and the lunar eclipse providing temporal pressure. The tricksters' manipulation creates genuine conflict, but Mara's agency feels limited—she executes a predetermined solution rather than making difficult choices. The resolution lacks visible cost despite claims of sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of trust versus manipulation emerges clearly but remains surface-level, lacking complexity or ambiguity. The story explicitly moralizes about "cosmic con artistry" and "genuine altruism" in the final third. The tricksters function as one-dimensional villains without nuance, and the resolution offers a too-tidy answer about refusing to play their game.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Mara could be any academic protagonist. The prose defaults to explanatory mode rather than filtering through character-specific observation. No dialogue appears, missing an opportunity for voice distinction and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from extensive exposition and summary, with most dramatic beats told rather than shown. Repetitive phrasing appears throughout ("cosmic tricksters," "power plays," "subsonic frequencies"). Information density is low, with multiple paragraphs restating the same concepts. The final paragraph is incomplete, suggesting structural issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept of cosmic parasites manipulating humanity through radio frequencies offers moderate freshness, but execution relies on familiar alien-invasion tropes. The resolution—exposing manipulation to break its power—follows predictable patterns. The specific use of subsonic frequencies and astronomical charts provides some originality within standard framework.</comment>
