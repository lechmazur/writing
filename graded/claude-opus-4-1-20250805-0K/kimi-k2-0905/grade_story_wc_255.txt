<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo's colorblindness driving his desperate search for impossible hues creates genuine motivation, and his acceptance of fractured beauty over perfection marks earned change. The contradiction between his inability to see color and his painter identity generates authentic tension. Minor deduction for Rosa's relatively thin characterization beyond her role as catalyst.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Milo's transformed understanding that "we are most alive where we are broken," with visible cost in his abandonment of painting. The accumulative/textural lens holds as glass arrangements and plant patterns build toward this reweighting. Slight opacity in the marble eye's mechanics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as active setting where phoenix ash, glass shards, and dying plants constrain choices and enable the final spiral garden. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("Rosa's voice rough from years of breathing molten sand"). The marble eye and reed tongue serve as micro-settings that shape transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Milo's search for color/beauty, deepening through the bartered exchange and plant arrangements until the revelation that "broken things sing louder." The cost is visible in Milo never painting again. Escalation could be sharper through the middle movements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of broken materials into art, avoiding explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. The final image of travelers seeking "a place where dying sang" offers resonant answer to questions of beauty and imperfection. Slight deduction for the somewhat declarative "we are most alive where we are broken."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled lyricism ("tiny cyclones that carried glass dust into the atmosphere"). POV remains stable with Milo, though brief omniscient glimpses of Rosa's thoughts create minor slippage. Strong perceptual signature in how Milo experiences the world through arrangement rather than color.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("terrible beauty of things that survive transformation") occasionally drifts from Milo's register, and minor repetition of "broken/breaking" concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of phoenix mythology with glassblowing and colorblind painting creates fresh synthesis. The concept of "bartered awakenings" where artists trade failures that hold memory offers original angle. The plant arrangement communication system adds unique texture though execution could be more specific.</comment>
