<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from inheriting her father's "senselessly perceptive eyes" to choosing her mother's path shows genuine internal conflict through concrete action—grafting his sandbag scrap into peace-gardens. The "pressing her ear to the ground" moment embodies her father's restless spirit finding rest through patient growing, earning the closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Mira's night-long grafting accumulates into the copper-petaled hybrid that transforms destruction into continuity. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she plants this new variety "in the exact spot where her father's airbag had fallen," though the cost could be more visceral rather than conceptual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cracked glass dome constrains Mira's work while desert wind and sand tremors from the tower's fall create atmospheric pressure. The greenhouse's "engraved quiet" that "felt like pressure, like diving deep underwater" effectively mirrors internal state, though more tactile plant-handling details could strengthen the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming violent legacy into peaceful continuity—deepens through Mira's methodical grafting work, with the sandbag scrap serving as the catalyst. While agency drives the resolution, escalation relies more on accumulation than active tightening; the "three days prior" timeline could create more urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "weaving continuity through chaos" emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and crystallizes in "accepting all threads—the violent and the peaceful." The roses blooming "brighter in spots where blood had soaked the earth" provides concrete imagery for transformation, avoiding abstract moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The contemplative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception like noting "how the coarse weave resembled the lines etched into her mother's weathered hands." Some passages drift toward elevated register ("tranquil blaze of sunset") that slightly diverges from the grounded POV established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of precision ("thorny bushes her mother had planted decades ago") but suffers from occasional redundancy—"patient work of growing things" follows "patient tending." The repeated "inculcating plants with values" phrase appears three times without variation, creating minor template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of plants as living memorials that "carried stories in their veins" offers fresh perspective on grief and legacy. The specific detail of grafting canvas from a bounty hunter's airbag into rose stems transforms familiar mourning tropes through concrete horticultural practice.</comment>
