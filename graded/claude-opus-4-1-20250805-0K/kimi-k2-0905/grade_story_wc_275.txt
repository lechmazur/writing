I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira transforms her father's violent legacy into living memorials.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's transformation of grief into patient cultivation reads as earned through concrete details like weaving canvas into stems. The "senselessly perceptive eyes" that notice blood-brightened roses creates genuine internal contradiction. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in processing dual parental legacies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira creates hybrid roses that unite both parents' paths, with visible cost in her father's death and the tower's destruction. The accumulative structure builds through horticultural actions toward this synthesis. Slight deduction for predictable resolution arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse micro-setting constrains choices effectively—cracked dome, blood-soaked earth, and rose thorns all shape Mira's actions. "Engraved quiet" as pressure and coral/cream forgiveness colors charge the atmosphere. Minor deduction for some generic desert descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming destruction into growth deepens through grafting sequences and the final planting. Cost is visible in the father's death and Mira's choice of peace over vengeance. The accumulative pressure builds but lacks a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete horticultural metaphors—grafting violence onto peace-rootstock, roses carrying "stories in their veins." The final image of hunter and pacifist united in the garden resonates without stating its moral. Slight deduction for occasional thematic explicitness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with selective perception ("roses bloomed brighter in spots where blood had soaked"). Some effective compression in "roses understood." Deduction for occasional elevated diction that strains POV credibility ("inculcating plants with values").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. However, template cadence appears in middle sections ("She had...", "She would...", "She worked...") and some paraphrase loops around plant-teaching philosophy. The phrase "inculcating plants with values" repeats verbatim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bounty hunter aftermath with botanical pacifism creates non-obvious angle. The specific detail of weaving airship canvas into rose stems shows originality. Deduction for somewhat predictable grief-to-growth arc despite unique execution.</comment>
