<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian's retrocognitive blessing creates genuine internal tension between witnessing past voices and pursuing present purpose, with embodied details like the prism "warm as if remembering light." Her choice to leave comfort for the desert skeleton demonstrates clear motivation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("patience of salt wind") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance between shards/silence/light that pays off in the final image of "rose glow" promising patterns exist. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as she "became the new prism," transforming from seeker to beacon with clear cost (isolation, responsibility). The quest structure provides clean causality through retrocognitive revelation → desert journey → shard recovery → lamp ignition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint: the "glass humming pavilion" vibrating between "mourning and morning" creates atmosphere while the desert's imposed silence ("no insect, no breeze") heightens the shard's power. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tower to desert to return. Deduction for some generic post-apocalyptic markers ("ringed husks of shopping malls") that lack specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: missing shard revelation → retrocognitive cost of seeing the child → desert journey's isolation → finding the skeleton → the hush that makes "the desert fell mute." The final transformation where she "became the new prism" represents meaningful deepening with visible cost of eternal vigil. Stakes remain coherent around rekindling hope despite darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of light/fracture/wholeness, culminating in "no fall is final." The revelation that "mother's death, the child's walk, her own return were not accidents but refractions of one intention" transforms coincidence into pattern without stating a moral. The final image of becoming the prism herself resonantly answers whether meaning exists in apparent randomness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "tide and star agreed on time, and tonight they argued." Perceptual signature shows in how she experiences retrocognition as "hot metal" spilling. Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively blessed," "calcification") fits the mythic register. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong opening "boots crunching on fragments of skylight that had once sung with dawn" and resonant close. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract constructions ("patience of salt wind," "hope in the shape of ribs") and some filter-heavy passages that reduce immediacy. Prose remains clear but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with lighthouse-keeper mythology and the original concept of retrocognition as curse/gift. The specific detail of the shard "fused there by years of patient calcification" shows imaginative precision. The transformation of coincidence into intentional pattern offers non-obvious insight, though some elements feel familiar from the genre.</comment>
