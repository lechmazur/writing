Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds toward emotional transformation through sensory accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's grief journey from numbness to feeling is earned through concrete embodied moments—vibrations through bones, tears gathering "silver as tin." The contradictory impulses (seeking sound she cannot hear, wanting raw pain over numbness) create authentic complexity. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "filament of hush" metaphor that occasionally drifts from embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mara accepting grief as "loud inside her silence," transforming numbness into resonant presence with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering toward this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for the "filament of hush" concept requiring some interpretive work to track its physical/metaphorical duality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cavern functions as more than setting—its materials (cedar, goatskin, packed earth) become conduits for vibration that enable Mara's transformation. Spatial choreography from entrance through workbench to drum-making is precise. The phonograph-drum pairing creates a micro-setting that constrains and enables the central emotional turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from seeking sound, to repairing the needle, to feeling backward music, to making the drum, each layer intensifying emotional stakes. The cost—welcoming grief's full weight—is felt through embodied description. Lacks a sharp reversal but the accumulative pressure effectively narrows Mara's emotional options toward acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete interplay of silence/sound, numbness/feeling, forward/backward. The final image of Mara pressing drum to heart while snow falls with "a hush she could almost hear" resonates without stating its meaning. The sister's kitchen laughter memory provides earned emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—Mara experiences the world through vibration and touch rather than sound. The prose modulates effectively from the opening's hushed atmosphere through the intensifying sensory work to the resolved ending. Sign language exchanges are handled elegantly without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid sensory specificity ("needle thinner than moth antenna," "hides stretched like moonlit lakes"). Some figurative density in places ("filament of hush" recurs perhaps too often) and occasional abstraction ("translucent layer from the numb cocoon") that slightly dulls immediacy. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The deaf music teacher experiencing sound through vibration offers a genuinely fresh angle on grief processing. The backward-playing record as emotional archaeology feels earned rather than gimmicky. The drum-making setting provides unexpected but organic metaphorical resonance. Some elements feel slightly familiar (grief as numbness) but the specific synthesis is distinctive.</comment>
