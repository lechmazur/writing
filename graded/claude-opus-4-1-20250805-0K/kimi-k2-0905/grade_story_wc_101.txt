I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds pressure through repeated midnight runs, accumulating pebbles, and density of detail toward a resonant final image.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is rooted in consistent traits—her councilor past informing her network leadership, her "gently persistent" nature embodied through repeated nocturnal rounds. The bell as unrung map home creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("intergenerational support") in dialogue that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the silent bell's vibration crystallizes the network's endurance with visible cost (sanctions tightening, rice tripling). The accumulative structure coheres through pebble collection building toward the incomplete spiral. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor functions as both setting and constraint—its cracked dome "like dried blood" charges the space with history. The bell's engraved mountains matching the ridge silhouette exemplifies purposeful detail. The pebble spiral at the arbor's center creates spatial meaning that shapes the eventual exodus decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: empty cart → hidden formula → pebble collection → incomplete spiral → silent bell toll. The tightening sanctions ("rice will triple") create genuine pressure. Stakes crystallize in Mara's choice between immediate aid and future exodus, with visible cost in either path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell that "never rings" yet holds memory, the pebbles saying "we are still here," names preserved in secret ledgers. The final silent toll that makes shutters open offers a resonant answer about resistance through presence. No explicit moralizing; the "amplified quiet" concept earns its thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "valley lights dimmed like censored stars," processes the cart's weight through false bottoms. Voice modulates effectively from hushed dialogue to declarative moments. Some register elevation ("intergenerational support coded as food lists") slightly strains the midnight-round context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity ("terra-cotta flakes glinting like dried blood," "sage scent rising like unbanned prayer"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She drew...She placed...She climbed") and occasional abstract phrasing ("frequency is harder to trace than volume") create slight drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of resistance through "amplified quiet" and silent bells that map home offers fresh perspective on exile narratives. The pebble-for-parcel exchange system and the bell's dual function as timekeeper and unrung map show specific invention. The sanctions-as-memory-rationing metaphor adds conceptual originality.</comment>
