<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to sustain her community under sanctions is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like the bell's "muted tremor" and her declaration "We eat tonight so we can think tomorrow." The transformation from food carrier to cultural preserver shows genuine character evolution through micro-choices (melting wax to seal the chronicle, removing felt from bell). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("eyes bright with distrust") rather than more specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with meaningful deepening as the bell transforms from summons to archive, and the arbor from meeting place to living text. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through collective reading of Lila's chronicle, with visible cost in the four-year siege and Lila's death. The pattern of midnight runs accumulates pressure effectively, though the final sentence cuts off mid-action, slightly diminishing the closure's full impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tiles as numbered text) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "clay tiles humming with the wind," "scent of blocked harbors." The setting evolves from pavilion to meeting place to encoded scripture, directly shaping tactics when Mara paints tile numbers on flatbread to evade searches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of community survival under sanctions intensifies through escalating scarcity (flour vanishing entirely) and adaptation (saffron ground to ink). The meaningful deepening occurs when Mara transforms preservation method from food distribution to cultural encoding. Cost is legible in Lila's death and the four-year duration, though agency could be stronger in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation through embodied practice emerges organically from concrete actions rather than stated morals. The bell's transformation from tool to archive offers a resonant non-literal answer about how memory persists through objects and bodies. Subtext operates beautifully in the anonymous donations as "investment, seeds planted in the soil of future voices."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("dropped star," "we will echo inside our bones") that maintains consistency without overwriting. Third-person limited POV stays cleanly with Mara throughout, with selective perception reflecting her priorities. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("cognitive smoothness") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "clay tiles humming with the wind that carried the scent of blocked harbors and empty markets." Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful compression. Some minor repetition in phrasing ("gently persistent" appears twice) and occasional abstraction ("eyes bright with distrust") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of siege narrative with cultural preservation through the specific image of numbered tiles becoming edible text. The transformation of anonymous charity into "investment" and the bell from tool to archive shows genuine originality. The specific detail of melting candle wax to seal chronicles inside the bell demonstrates inventive problem-solving grounded in available materials.</comment>
