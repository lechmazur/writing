Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through lyrical description and pattern-based imagery toward a resonant closure where silence defeats the energy beings.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like reading ice fractures and preserving scrolls. Her internal conflict between survival-through-silence and the need to preserve memory creates authentic tension. The final choice to release the echo chamber stone's stories demonstrates earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the "bloom of hush" defeats the energy beings and releases the stored voices. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from silence-as-survival to silence-as-weapon. Cost is visible in the cracked echo chamber stone and the uncertain future ("she might never see"). Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors could be clearer earlier) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active setting, with stalactites that "chimed if you breathed too hard" and the Abyssal Gate's unreachable frequency constraining choices throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("gently luminous veins," "curtains of mineral lace"). The dome's transformation through scored silence lines demonstrates environment-as-participant in the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to preserving collective memory, with the bloom of hush providing a ticking clock. The energy beings' presence creates constant pressure that shapes every movement. The final confrontation where silence becomes active weapon represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of silence-as-preservation and sound-as-threat, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final whisper "We were here" resonates as testament to persistence without stating meaning. The echo chamber stone's release of "every swallowed word in a single sigh that carried no sound, only meaning" offers a non-literal answer to survival versus memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("soft as hammered repose"). The perceptual signature focuses on texture and vibration fitting the sound-based world. Minor repetition of "gently luminous" and some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she knelt") in peak moments prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She pressed the echo chamber stone to his lips; the relic drank the words"). Some template cadence appears mid-story ("She knelt... She lifted... She wrapped"). The syntactic variety generally supports the accumulative rhythm, though occasional overwriting ("hammered repose") doesn't fully earn its figurative weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of sound-eating beings forcing evolutionary silence-based survival offers genuine freshness. The ice-reading augury system and "bloom of hush" as temporal phenomenon show specific world-building. The transformation of silence from defensive to offensive tool demonstrates risk-taking that heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
