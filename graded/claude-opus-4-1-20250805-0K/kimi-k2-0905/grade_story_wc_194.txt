<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's internal journey from "dynasty ender" to truth-seeker shows clear motivation through concrete actions (searching for the handle, choosing to play the confession, walking to the river). The cost of losing their name/identity lands with embodied detail ("tears mixing with dust to make pale mud"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "purpose carved into marrow" that could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Arin transforms from dynasty heir to nameless truth-teller, with visible cost (blood, name erasure). The causal chain from finding handle → hearing confession → public revelation → walking to river holds cleanly. Orientation anchors established early (reading room, Arin Vale, evening). Minor deduction for Muse's sudden appearance feeling slightly convenient despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room with its brass gramophone, dusty light, and faded carpet creates atmospheric pressure that enables key choices. "Standing waves" as a method of finding the handle shows setting constraining action. The river lands as meaningful destination. Deduction for some overwrought description ("golden shadows folding like slow wings") that doesn't always serve pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear escalation from searching → finding warm handle → turning crank → hearing confession → public revelation, with mounting cost at each stage (blood, name, identity). The "warm handle" suggesting recent presence raises stakes effectively. Agency drives every turn. Minor deduction because the middle section with Muse could tighten pressure more directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of inherited guilt versus truth emerges powerfully through the confession scene and Arin's choice to lose their name rather than preserve dynasty. The final image of learning "the people's new names for tomorrow" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Blood mixing with ink on the river map creates visceral thematic fusion. Strong subtext in "eloquently silent" moments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated register ("sepia reading room," "ancestral breath") that matches the dynastic setting. POV remains stable with Arin. Some effective compression in the confession sequence. Deduction for occasional overwriting that strains the metaphors ("dust as ancestral breath returning to testify") and reduces immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density adequate with most lines advancing story. However, multiple instances of overwrought figurative language ("golden shadows pooling," "wings of shadow," "stepping-stone across the bridge of intuition") create density issues. Some paraphrase loops around the dust/breath imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of sound waves persisting across generations offers fresh angle on inherited guilt. Arin as "dynasty ender" who chooses truth over heritage shows specificity. The gramophone as confession-keeper transforms a familiar object. Some derivative elements in the mystical archivist figure and overly symbolic blood/ink mixing reduce originality.</comment>
