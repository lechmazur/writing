I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through dense imagery and symbolic accretion toward a resonant reconfiguration where Arin transforms from dynasty heir to nameless truth-bearer.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation drives clearly from "dynasty ender" identity through discovery to self-erasure, with the wound/blood treaty providing embodied cost. The "tears mixing with dust to make pale mud" and bloodied hand gripping the broken handle show genuine embodied emotion under pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("purpose carved into marrow") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - Arin's name "burned clean" and blood mingling with ink creates a new treaty. The accumulative build through gramophone turning, confession playing, and public revelation coheres under the textural lens. The "jagged star of brass" cutting skin provides immediate physical cost, while identity erasure marks conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room effectively constrains action through its "brass gramophone" and "northwest shelves," with golden shadows creating atmospheric pressure. The "dust like powdered light" that Arin breathes as "ancestral breath" integrates setting with theme. Environment actively shapes the search and discovery, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("tasseled lamps").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: finding handle → turning crank → hearing confession → breaking handle → revealing truth publicly. The "each rotation a generation, each click a crown hitting flagstones" creates rhythmic pressure. Cost manifests in the broken handle drawing blood and Arin's name erasure, though middle sections could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the gramophone's "bridge between fallen kings and hidden truth," with the blood/ink treaty powerfully reweighting ancestral crimes. The final image of "statues wearing river flowers" while Arin walks nameless toward the river resonates without stating a moral. "Dynasty ender" identity transforms from burden to purpose through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("sepia silhouettes," "eloquently silent") maintains atmospheric consistency. Some register elevation feels forced ("bridge of intuition between fallen kings") and occasional overwriting clouds clarity. The POV remains stable, though filter-heavy constructions ("Arin sensed," "Arin detected") accumulate in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dust like powdered light," "each rotation a generation") but suffers from density overload and some purple patches. Multiple filter verbs cluster in exploration sequences ("Arin knew," "Arin breathed," "Arin sensed," "Arin detected"). The "eloquently silent" repetition works thematically but creates mild redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dynasty-confession-on-wax premise offers fresh angle on inherited guilt, with the gramophone as confession vessel feeling original. The transformation from heir to nameless witness subverts expected power dynamics. Some elements feel overly literary ("Muse" as archivist, "standing waves" as memory), but the blood/ink treaty image and river flower ending show genuine ingenuity.</comment>
