<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seeker's internal contradiction between hollow amnesia and the need to remember harm is embodied through concrete actions (pressing baseball to temple, stepping into luminescent water). The final choice to carry "unfiltered guilt" and write letters shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (backwards clocks, bioluminescent bacteria, orbiting baseball) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where accepting guilt transforms into "delicately robust weight of being reusable." The time-loop closure with the traveler catching a fresh-signed ball crystallizes the conceptual cost of redemption as perpetual turnstile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underground lake functions as transformative setting where "bioluminescence crawled under his skin" constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (water "glowed like bottled auroras," silence "felt wet against the skin").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking forgotten identity to absorbing "every pain he caused" with the lake's bargain forcing irreversible choice. The cost manifests viscerally as "heart restarted with borrowed rhythms of every life he had shortened."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of redemption as "turnstile you keep pushing while others squeeze through with you" rather than doorway. The final loop where the time traveler reads a "fresh signature" resonantly reweights the opening's signed baseball without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyric compression ("nurses spoke in pastels," "obituaries bled ink"). POV remains controlled through surreal imagery while maintaining emotional coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("memory returned not as narrative but as nausea"). Some elevated diction ("delicately robust yearning") occasionally drifts from established register but doesn't harm closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of memory-scrubbing procedure leading to bioluminescent lake of absorbed pain is genuinely fresh. The time-loop structure with baseball as temporal anchor transforms redemption narrative through specific synthesis.</comment>
