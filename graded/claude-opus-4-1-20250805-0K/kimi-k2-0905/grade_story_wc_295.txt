I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where shared burdens transform into shared light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chronicler's internal journey from burden-bearer to transformed healer shows genuine contradictory impulses ("I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled"). Her realization that she carries others' grief as insomnia creates embodied cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("not from sadness but relief") rather than fully embodied reactions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the temple's grief transforms into shared light, with visible cost in the chronicler's accumulated stories becoming "smooth glass." The accumulative structure coheres well through returning daylily imagery. Slight opacity in the reality-shift mechanics (observatory becoming desert) that doesn't fully clarify its rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The copper-domed observatory and desert temple create dual settings that constrain choices effectively. The daylily's spectral ink healing the telescope demonstrates environment shaping action. Strong sensory work with "star-charts rustled like sleeping birds." Minor deduction for some abstract spatial transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as inscriptions reveal increasing layers of meaning, culminating in shared burden becoming shared light. The chronicler's agency drives the transformation through speaking petal-syllables. Cost is visible but could be more viscerally felt in the body rather than conceptually stated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete transformation of grief into light via stellar cycles and pressed flowers. The final image of daylilies "blooming forever between pages of starlight" offers a non-literal answer to how burdens transform. Strong integration without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and strong perceptual signature ("fingers still smelling of ink"). The shift to first-person ("I am the chronicler") works as intentional distance modulation. Beautiful patterned repetition that teaches its own logic. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each petal bore a bruise-shaped syllable"). Excellent syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deduction for metaphor density in peak beats without full payoff and occasional abstract phrasing ("electromagnetic winds") that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream chronicling, stellar observation, and botanical preservation creates an original constellation. The specific detail of SS Lacertae's 19.3-hour pulse and daylily ink that heals metal shows genuine invention. Risk-taking with reality-shift and lyric mode heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
