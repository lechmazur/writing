<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Foresight Hindsight Only's paradoxical temporality ("born without a future or a past, only the instant between them") creates genuine internal contradiction that drives her final dissolution into the storm. The character's transformation from seeker to medium shows earned change with visible cost as she literally dissolves ("Lightning unthreads her name"). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("knows the bunker is negotiating its own escape") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the protagonist dissolves into the storm-path with clear cost ("Lightning unthreads her name; rain rewrites it in shifting syllables"). The wafer seal's transformation from "decaying directive" to living tattoo to final dissolution creates coherent progression. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (protagonist at bunker). Minor deduction for slightly abstract middle section transitions between dream and waking states.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bunker as living architecture ("precisely playful corridors," "negotiating its own escape") constrains and enables the protagonist's transformation, ultimately "undressing" into seed form. Environment actively participates in closure as "vine-draped heart where ethereal grit is the only remaining directive." The storm functions as co-agent rather than backdrop, creating the "spiral staircase of rain" for ascension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: seal warming → dream dissolution → seal melting into skin → bunker transformation → protagonist dissolving into storm. The cost is unmistakable as she loses physical form ("Lightning unthreads her name"). Stakes tighten from discovering "why paths choose walkers" to becoming the path itself with clear foreclosure of human existence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the path/walker paradox resolved in the final image: "walkers and paths are one another's becoming." The recurring directive's transformation from "Maintain continuity" to "Continuity is the art of letting go in the right order" reweights the entire premise. The dream-bird's map metaphor and footprints walking away create resonant non-literal answers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic language ("air tastes of rust and wet stone," "sound equal parts crystal and rust"). Voice maintains lyric compression under pressure without losing clarity. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("ethereal grit," "transcendence through interpreted dreams") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon in non-pattern moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The storm approaches like a memory of thunder"). Some figurative density in peak beats borders on oversaturation ("Lightning unthreads her name; rain rewrites it in shifting syllables") but maintains coherence. Deduction for abstract phrasing ("negotiating its own escape," "one another's becoming") that could be more concrete, and occasional template cadence in the middle dream sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central conceit of paths choosing walkers inverts expected agency brilliantly, with the protagonist's dissolution into weather/path as bold structural risk that heightens meaning. The "wafer seal" as decaying technological directive transformed into organic tattoo offers fresh synthesis. Bonus for committing fully to the dissolution without safety-hedging.</comment>
