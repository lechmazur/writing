<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ansel's internal journey from mechanical problem-solving to accepting mystery shows genuine character evolution, with his choice to lock away wonder rather than destroy it carrying visible cost. The "peripherally focused" attention creates a consistent perceptual signature that shapes how he engages with the cavern's mysteries. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("feeling the new seconds fit him like a tailored skin") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the timer's reverse-engineering creating a pattern break that releases the trapped hours, culminating in Ansel's Earned Stasis of storing wonder "for later." The closure lands with clear cost—sealing away discovery rather than exploiting it. Slight deduction for the orientation arriving slowly (who/where clarifies gradually through inference rather than anchoring).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as more than setting—its reflective surfaces and acoustic properties directly enable the echo-harvesting mechanism and constrain Ansel's methods. Excellent integration of sensory detail ("cold light," "veins of quartz") with the story's conceptual core. The cavern's transformation from thief to archive drives the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing time's theft—escalates through Ansel's discovery that the timer converts echo to torque, forcing him to choose between restoration and understanding. His decision to seal the device rather than exploit it shows meaningful agency with cost. Some middle sections lack immediate pressure as he studies patterns, though this fits the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of wonder versus reason emerges organically through Ansel's actions, with the final image of storing wonder "ready for any future hour when reason might grow lonely" offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The harvest of echoes becoming "cherries dropping in an orchard" reweights the entire premise from theft to natural cycle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("wounded season's last sun like frost on a dying breath") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature of peripheral focus shapes both prose rhythm and thematic revelation. Minor repetition of "wounded season" and some elevated diction ("crepuscular hours") that occasionally strains against the locksmith's pragmatic nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and plot mechanics). Some figurative density in places ("like cherries dropping in an orchard just beyond the edge of hearing") but it serves the accumulative design. Minor scaffold in repeated "wounded season" phrase and occasional abstract constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of time stored in echoes and a timer that harvests voices offers genuine freshness, executed through specific mechanical details rather than handwaving. The transformation of a locksmith into someone who locks away wonder provides an earned character-concept synthesis. The piece commits fully to its lyrical-mechanical hybrid vision.</comment>
