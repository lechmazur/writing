<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Myrrh's motivation through olfactory sensitivity and ambition drives concrete choices, particularly in the grafting sequence where her "serenity within motion" transforms from goal to embodied state. The mother-daughter relationship adds depth through shared customs and scent memories. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ambition loosen into gratitude") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Myrrh achieves "serenity within motion" as internalized companion rather than external goal, with visible cost in leaving her journal for wind-spirits. The grafting sequence builds pressure through sensory accumulation. Slight deduction for abstract opening ("tide's thought") that delays concrete anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treetop village functions as living organism constraining Myrrh's choices—bridges narrowing to "mere suggestion" force careful movement. Olfactory details ("iron, then bruised banana") and spatial choreography remain precise throughout. The village's swaying enables the central insight about motion within stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieving successful graft while embodying family wisdom) escalates through narrowing physical space and intensifying sensory pressure. The seed's ten-year-early bloom provides meaningful reversal. Cost is visible in Myrrh's transformation from ambitious herbalist to one who gifts her knowledge away.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the doodled birds inside wrapping paper manifest as village dreams of "flying hares exhaling birds." The mother's spiral-around-hare drawing pays off in Myrrh's final journal image. Family custom of hidden messages enriches the exploration of revelation through concealment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through specialized vocabulary ("cambium," "moon-mulled violets") and sensory-forward perception. POV remains tightly controlled with Myrrh's olfactory sensitivity shaping perception. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("undercurrent of wisdom") that briefly shifts register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence structure. However, "undercurrent of wisdom" appears twice verbatim, and some abstract phrasing ("tide's thought," "ambition loosen into gratitude") reduces immediacy. Information density is high in the grafting sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical expertise with mystical elements through concrete sensory detail. The family custom of doodling inside wrapping paper offers original approach to hidden/revealed dynamics. The corpse flower's accelerated bloom and village's collective dreaming create memorable world-logic.</comment>
