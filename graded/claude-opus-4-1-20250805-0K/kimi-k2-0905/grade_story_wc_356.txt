<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Myrrh's ambition softening into gratitude creates a genuine arc with embodied sensory detail (pressing seed to cheek, breathing through mouth). The mother-daughter relationship adds depth through gesture and scent memory. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ambition loosen into gratitude") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with the seed grafting creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where "serenity no longer a goal but a companion." Cost is visible in the ten-year commitment and the notebook offering. Slight dock for the abstract opening line that delays orientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The treetop village functions as both setting and character ("swayed like a single breathing organism"), constraining Myrrh's movements and choices throughout. Sensory hierarchy reflects her olfactory sensitivity perfectly. The bark scarred by generations elevates the graft site beyond mere location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of achieving serenity through the grafting intensifies well, with the seed's precarious balance between fusion and destruction creating genuine tension. The tide reversal and wind spirits add pressure. Cost is clear in the decade-long commitment and the surrendered notebook.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the family custom of hidden doodles revealing truth, paid off when Myrrh draws "a seed that had become a quiet heart" inside her journal. The corpse flower's sweet death scent making villagers dream creates resonant imagery without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through olfactory details and precise botanical language. The lyrical rhythm matches the swaying village perfectly. Free indirect style clean throughout with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some repetitive phrasing ("Myrrh" appears 17 times, "seed" clusters heavily) and abstract constructions ("turning of the tide's thought") that slow momentum. Strong information density in middle sections. Deduction for opening opacity and occasional purple prose ("moon-mulled violets").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed as a ten-year commitment requiring perfect rot-fusion balance is fresh. The family custom of interior doodles on wrapping paper offers genuine novelty. The synesthetic "tide's thought" and village-as-organism push boundaries while maintaining coherence.</comment>
