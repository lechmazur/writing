<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal progression from skepticism to acceptance drives meaningful change, with contradictory impulses (scientific rationality vs. undeniable telepathic evidence) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to illuminate connections rather than resist shows earned transformation with visible cost. However, secondary characters remain somewhat functional despite their revealed inner states, and Maya's "affectionate skepticism" feels more labeled than embodied through specific micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's shift from isolation to connection-building, with the geode serving as catalyst. Causality holds as the telepathy pills' recall creates context for the geode's amplification effect. However, the mechanism linking recalled pills to the geode's power feels convenient rather than earned, and the story ends mid-sentence ("looked at each"), creating ambiguity about whether closure fully lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as active setting, with LED trails and long-exposure photography constraining and enabling Maya's discovery of hidden connections. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as multiple artists' light patterns converge. The muscovite geode's "fractally precise patterns" mirror the revealed human connections effectively, though some technical details about telepathy residue lack grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding/accepting telepathic connection—escalates from personal sensation to collective revelation. Maya's agency drives the illumination of connections between strangers. However, the resolution comes too easily without meaningful resistance or cost; the other artists simply accept and participate without skepticism, deflating potential conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of light revealing hidden connections between isolated individuals. The teenager's escape, widower's grief, and instructor's fear create specific embodiments of disconnection that Maya's light-bridges address. The final image of permanent photographic evidence resonates, though the theme of connection-over-isolation resolves somewhat tidily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Maya, with perceptual details filtered through her scientific mindset ("residual static electricity"). Voice modulates appropriately as telepathic awareness floods in. However, some passages drift toward omniscient knowledge about the recall's true reason, and occasional filter-verb clusters ("she noticed," "she watched," "she felt") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("trails of luminescence that hung in the air like ghostly brushstrokes") but suffers from repetitive structures and filter-verb stacks. Multiple instances of "Maya [verb]" openings create template cadence. The unfinished final sentence ("looked at each") appears to be a technical error rather than artistic choice, significantly harming closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of telepathy pills causing genuine connection rather than hallucinations offers a modest twist on familiar territory. The light painting as metaphor for revealing connections shows some ingenuity. However, the premise feels derivative of common sci-fi tropes without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail or unique moral calculus.</comment>
