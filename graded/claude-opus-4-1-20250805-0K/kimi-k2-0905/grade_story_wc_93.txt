<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's precognitive curse creates genuine internal contradiction—knowing futures he cannot change—that drives choices with visible cost. His promise to Mira and subsequent surrender to the patterns shows earned transformation through specific experience. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("surrendering to currents they could never see") but the embodied final gesture of touching the dissolving eel grounds the character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching throughout, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias understands promises are "meant to be broken by understanding." The cost is visible: Mira's death reframed as necessary pattern, the eels dissolving into light. Slight deduction for the frictionless world setup that could anchor more clearly early on, but the closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and painted rocks constrain choices—Elias must place them in precise mathematical sequences to harness the star dust. The frictionless world creates specific physical constraints (should slip but doesn't, eels escape water's resistance). Setting directly charges the final image of eels swimming through air between rocks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: placing rocks in sequence → star dust singing → rocks resonating → eels returning transformed. The dominant stake (understanding sacred patterns before the tide) tightens through each mathematical placement. Cost is legible in the eel's dissolution and Mira's death-as-pattern revelation, though the pressure could intensify more sharply in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern/surrender paradox without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias walking in the frictionless world while the constellation fades offers a non-literal answer about promises and understanding. Mira's words about patterns in "spaces between what we think we know" gain resonance through dramatized discovery. The sacred patterns as witness rather than comprehension avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("aurora above the tidal bluff shimmered like a borrowed dawn"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("geometric absence," "constellation of collapsed star dust") slightly exceeds the eel herder's likely lexicon. POV control remains stable, though filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("he saw himself placing," "he knew").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("eels swam through sky and stars sang in pockets") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some metaphorical density without clear payoff ("geometry of absence"). Filter verb clusters in middle section ("he saw," "he knew," "he understood") reduce immediacy. Information density generally high but some conceptual loops around pattern/understanding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frictionless world premise and mathematical eel migration create fresh synthesis. Precognitive curse that shows unchangeable futures offers non-obvious angle on fate/agency. The painted rocks as mathematical keys and eels dissolving into constellations feel earned through prior particulars. Transformation of the promise concept—from understanding to witnessing to breaking—shows conceptual sophistication.</comment>
