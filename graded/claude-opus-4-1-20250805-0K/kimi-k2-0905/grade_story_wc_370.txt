<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's compassion manifests through embodied perception of others' emotions and her final transformation into benevolent guidance. The motivation to correct her past mistake drives coherent choices culminating in self-erasure as redemption. Minor deduction for the resolution feeling slightly abstract despite the earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elara dissolves into the library's consciousness, with visible cost of surrendering her physical future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with patterns of paradox and presence/absence building to the transformation. The "mistake was never the mis-delivery" realization reweights the entire premise effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret library beneath the metro station creates genuine constraint through the midnight purge mechanism and mirrored surfaces that enable the transformation. Sensory detail like "chill marble" and "ember-red" chandeliers supports atmosphere. The setting directly enables the closure through the invitation's absorption properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from guilt over three deaths through Vale's approach to the final surrender, with the midnight purge creating temporal urgency. The choice to "stay while leaving" represents genuine agency with irreversible cost. Stakes remain coherent under the textural lens as paradoxes accumulate toward transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The paradox of presence through absence emerges organically from events, culminating in "the greatest presence is the gentlest absence." The theme develops through concrete particulars—the blank invitation, the mirrored desk, the transformation into hush. The cyclical ending with future recluses enriches without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled syntax like "folding noise into the spines of forbidden books." Some register drift toward abstraction in passages like "diffuse yet awake" slightly dulls immediacy. POV remains stable throughout the single-scene focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the stacks exhaled a hush so complete") but occasional abstract phrasing ("enlarged tranquility" appears multiple times) creates mild opacity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Minor template cadence in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a librarian becoming the library itself through sacrificial dissolution offers fresh transformation of the redemption arc. The specific mechanism of the invitation drinking its bearer whole feels inventive. The paradoxical solution grows naturally from established elements rather than convenient resolution.</comment>
