<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's internal conflict between preservation duty and personal loss manifests through concrete micro-choices (steeping the locket into the tube). Her motivation intensifies credibly from professional obligation to sacrificial act, with the locket photo creating a visceral parallel between the drowned boy and her daughter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the archivist's sacrificial gesture of sealing her locket in the tube—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the "steep absence like a clean nail wound"). The piece anchors who/where/when early and builds through sensory accumulation, though the final scene with the daughter could strengthen the cost's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jetty functions as active setting—its "salt-rimmed planks," "loose board," and "furthest piling" with dried sunflowers constrain the archivist's documentation choices and create the pressure of imminent demolition. The walnut ink bleeding into surfaces and the copper tube's patina ground the atmosphere in tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional preservation to personal sacrifice as the archivist moves from sketching to surrendering her locket, with demolition's approach ("Distant engines growled") tightening pressure. The cost materializes in the "steep absence" and her daughter's recognition of the missing locket, though the final apartment scene slightly diffuses urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of memory as active force ("artifacts become verbs") emerges through concrete images—sunflowers dried into wood, the boy's negative space, the locket pressed against sketch. The final waltz where mother and daughter play together while the "demolition crews slept" offers a non-literal answer about preservation through transformation rather than stasis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice filters perception through archival consciousness ("walnut-ink," "regenerated covenant stones," "proximate causes"), with syntax modulating under pressure (shorter fragments as she works faster). The security guard exchange carries naturalistic subtext, though occasional elevated diction ("haunted euphoria") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind carried haunted euphoria: gulls laughing like children who knew they were already ghosts"). Some repetitive phrasing around "weight of small moments" and "regenerated covenant" creates minor loops, and the phrase "steep absence" feels forced, but propulsion remains strong through varied sentence lengths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The archivist preserving a drowning site through walnut ink while sacrificing her daughter's photo offers a fresh angle on memory and loss. The specific detail of sunflowers dried into wood and the mother-daughter parallel avoid generic grief narrative, though the archival conceit itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
