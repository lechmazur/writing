<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—sketching barnacles, preserving the boy's memory, sacrificing her locket—with embodied emotion in "pulse syncing with waves" and "steep absence like a clean nail wound." The daughter relationship provides subtle pressure that forces the final choice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria") but the cost of her sacrifice lands viscerally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the archivist's locket sacrifice transforms memory from personal possession to public covenant, with clear cost in the "empty wrist" and daughter's recognition. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from individual sketching to communal preservation. Slight deduction for the abrupt ending mid-sentence ("motel") which weakens the final beat's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The jetty's physical decay ("salt-rimmed plank," "loose board, slick algae") directly shapes the archivist's urgency and method, while sensory detail grounds the atmosphere effectively. The regenerated covenant stones and sunflower petals create a lived-in world that constrains choices. Setting functions as more than backdrop, though the final apartment scene could use sharper spatial anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory before demolition—tightens through approaching "contractors testing equipment" and the security encounter, forcing the locket sacrifice. Cost is visible in the permanent loss and the daughter's observation. The escalation works under the accumulative lens but could benefit from one more intermediate pressure point between arrival and sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between preservation and demolition, with the locket transformation offering a non-literal answer about memory's persistence through material sacrifice. The "regenerated covenant" concept layers meaningfully throughout, and the final piano scene resonates without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the security guard's retreat and the daughter's understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("sky forgets its own colors") and consistent perceptual signature focused on texture and decay. The dialogue between archivist and guard carries effective subtext. Some register elevation ("haunted euphoria," "proximate causes") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, and the syntactic patterns could vary more under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria" appears twice, "proximate causes" twice) create mild repetition. The abrupt truncation at "motel" harms momentum at closure. Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs, though some philosophical abstractions ("when context changes, artifacts become verbs") slow the narrative drive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist preserving intangible memory through physical sacrifice offers a fresh angle on loss and preservation. The specific detail of walnut ink and copper tubes grounds the concept memorably. The transformation of the locket from personal talisman to public covenant shows genuine ingenuity, though the "haunted euphoria" phrase feels less original through repetition.</comment>
