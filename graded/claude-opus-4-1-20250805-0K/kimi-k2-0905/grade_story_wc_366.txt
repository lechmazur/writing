Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural drive lens**, as the piece builds meaning through layered images, ritual exchanges, and symbolic accumulation rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's character emerges beautifully through embodied details—his ritual of building cairns from islands he's served, the specific way he reads the stones' "mute Morse." The internal contradiction between his duty to maintain and his acceptance of absence creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("the ache was sharper") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the sea glass's warmth traveling "through his glove to the bone"—a physical manifestation of connection despite the tower's darkness. The accumulative pattern of stone messages and sea glass exchanges builds to this moment where absence itself becomes a form of presence, with clear emotional cost in the keeper's continued isolation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse breathes with lived detail—"Wind sighed through cracked panes high above, carrying the salt-ghost of every ship." The recurring sea glass that "glowed like dawn trapped under skin" and the stones' specific qualities (quartz stripe, robin's heart size) create a micro-setting that directly shapes the ritual exchange. The tower's agency ("exhaled a cold gust") elevates atmosphere beyond description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining connection through absence—intensifies when "the lamp had coughed twice before surrendering." The escalation from finding stones seven years ago to tonight's fear "the keeper might finally have stepped over the rail" creates meaningful pressure. The final stone click confirming "she was still keeping, still asking" provides resolution with the cost of continued separation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central image of keeping "the chain unbroken"—both the literal stone messages and the metaphorical connection between isolated souls. The concept that "nothing here faded" despite the lamp's death creates rich ambiguity about preservation versus stasis. The final image of "memory of radiance, fragile but sufficient" resonates without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains exquisite control with phrases like "salt-ghost" and "luminescent ache" that feel earned rather than ornamental. Elias's perceptual signature—reading stones like Morse code, measuring safety in the clink of glass—creates a distinct consciousness. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("conspired with the sea") that briefly exceeds the skipper's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" advances action while revealing character psychology. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythms. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in places ("starless dark" could be "starless") and one instance of mild redundancy in emotional description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain using stacked stones as language between two people who never meet offers genuine originality. The specific synthesis—a supply skipper who protects not from storms but "from forgetting"—transforms the lighthouse keeper trope. The risk of sustaining an entire story through absence and indirect communication pays off through accumulated specific detail.</comment>
