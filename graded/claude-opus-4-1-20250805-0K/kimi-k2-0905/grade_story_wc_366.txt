<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's reticence manifests through concrete action—building cairns, reading stone messages, never speaking—with his "warmly observant eyes" revealing contradictory impulses between connection and distance. The keeper's absence as physical presence while maintaining the stone dialogue creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the keeper remaining entirely off-page, limiting relationship-as-crucible potential, though the constraint itself generates meaningful cost through isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the stone dialogue pattern accumulating meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's backward rowing maintains sight of the dark tower while carrying the warm glass—a Charged Poise that crystallizes their sustained connection despite absence. The lamp's death accelerates urgency and the final "memory of radiance, fragile but sufficient" lands with felt cost of continued isolation. Slight deduction for the keeper's click being somewhat convenient timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower as breathing entity, the stones' precise material details (white quartz stripe, robin's heart size, rust smear), and the sea glass's chromatic shifts create a micro-setting where objects become the primary landscape. The "salt-ghost of every ship that had ever broken here" and specific sensory work like "wet iron and old hymns" ground the haunted atmosphere. The stones and glass constrain communication method, directly shaping the story's central dynamic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining connection through the anonymous stone dialogue—deepens when the lamp dies "as though the lantern itself had given up," raising fears the keeper "might finally have stepped over the rail." The protagonist's agency manifests through his stone choices and glass-bottling ritual, with the backward rowing crystallizing his commitment despite the cost of never meeting. Slightly limited by the keeper's off-page status reducing direct confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "memory of radiance, fragile but sufficient" transforms the darkness into paradoxical preservation of light through ritual and connection. The stone dialogue embodies communication beyond words, while "the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal" captures the impossibility yet necessity of their exchange. Strong thematic resonance emerges from concrete particulars rather than stated meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional perceptual signature with Elias reading stones like "mute Morse" and experiencing the tower's breath, creating a distinct seafarer's consciousness attuned to material messages. The controlled withholding of the keeper's appearance while revealing her through traces maintains POV discipline. Prose rhythm modulates from meditative observation to urgent concern when contemplating her possible suicide, with syntax tightening appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with lines like "salt-ghost of every ship that had ever broken here" doing multiple jobs. Strong syntactic variety from short declarations ("He never spoke; she never appeared") to complex accumulations. The "luminescent ache" tone pervades without overwhelming, and technical precision in nautical/lighthouse details maintains credibility. Minor repetition of "stone/stones" is purposeful pattern-building rather than loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The anonymous lighthouse dialogue through stones and sea glass offers a fresh angle on isolation and connection, avoiding typical keeper-visitor dynamics. The specific material language of their exchange—each stone's origin and marking creating meaning—transforms a potential ghost story into something more emotionally complex. The constraint of never meeting generates genuine dramatic pressure rather than arbitrary withholding.</comment>
