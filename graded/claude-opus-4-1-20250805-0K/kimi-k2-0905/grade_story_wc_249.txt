<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between grief and hope manifests through embodied action (drumming as communication) with genuine contradictory impulses. The choice to dissolve into unity carries visible cost—her physical form dispersing into light. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("half-life," "soul stretched thin") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara transforms into frequency/light, with visible cost (physical dissolution). The accumulative/textural lens holds as drumming patterns build to transformation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the experimental treatment context.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting—crystalline reeds sing, floating seed pods become instruments, the auric lagoon responds to frequencies. Environment directly enables the transformation through its acoustic architecture. The golden light and water imagery charges the final dissolution effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on reuniting with Lila through transformation, with clear escalation from tentative drumming to full dissolution. The cost is unmistakable—Mara's physical form dispersing. Minor deduction as the middle section relies more on reflection than active pressure, though the accumulative lens supports this approach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete choice of unity over separation, becoming "the very air that carried sound." The transformation from individual to frequency offers a non-literal answer about connection transcending physical boundaries. The recurring drum-communication motif accumulates meaning without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through sound-focused observation and scientific-poetic register ("quantum foam," "auric lagoon"). Controlled psychic distance that deepens appropriately during transformation. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in peak moments ("cathedral," "parishioner") that momentarily exceeds Mara's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery and rhythm control, particularly in transformation sequences. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "drumming on everything" (4x), some filter-verb clustering ("felt," "understood," "remembered"), and occasional purple prose ("auroral sorrow that now colored the garden's sky").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum entanglement with sound-as-consciousness creates memorable premise. The transformation into frequency rather than typical reunion or separation offers non-obvious resolution. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
