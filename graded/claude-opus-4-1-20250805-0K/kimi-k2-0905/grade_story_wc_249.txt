I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory memories and rhythmic patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira transforms from isolated guinea pig to "conductor emeritus."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal struggle between dissolved and retained identity drives credible choices, particularly the drumming-as-resistance motif. The transformation from "quietest rebel" to "conductor emeritus" feels earned through embodied struggle. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory grafts that could be more viscerally rendered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira shifts from fighting the chorus to conducting it, with visible cost in her "weary smile." The accumulative lens holds as memories layer and release through rhythmic action. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (clinical context emerges gradually) and some causality softness around how drumming mechanically dissolves memories.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon function as active participants constraining choices - the garden amplifies her drumming into "rolling thunder," the lagoon recognizes her "altered electrolytes." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("leaves cupping starlight into pale green speakers"). Strong integration of setting as both obstacle and solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Central stake of identity preservation escalates from drumming on quartz to wading into dissolution, with meaningful deepening when Mira realizes "entanglement ran both ways." The shift from resistance to harmony demonstrates clear cost. Minor deduction for the resolution feeling slightly predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of individual versus collective identity emerges organically through concrete imagery - the "communal inhale" and "auroral veil" of shared dreams. The ending's "alone and together" paradox resonates without moralizing. Strong subtext in the garden's response patterns mirroring Mira's internal state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the hush of the universe inhaling") and consistent perceptual signature focused on sound/rhythm. Some register elevation in places ("conductor emeritus," "collaborative color") slightly strains the intimate POV. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("leaves folded into satellite dishes") with good syntactic variety. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bioluminescent jellyfish" metaphor), some template phrasing ("One by one"), and density issues where figurative language clusters without advancing pressure in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of memory grafts creating a shared consciousness offers fresh angle on identity dissolution. Specific inventions like "auric fluid" extraction and the sound-responsive garden avoid generic sci-fi. The resolution's embrace of "entangled yet unmistakably free" provides non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode pays off.</comment>
