<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lys's internal conflict between her contractual bondage and desire for liberation drives consistent, embodied choices throughout, particularly in her physical responses to the prism's veins ("feeling her own blood answer in iambs"). The final choice to remain as "the first voice that refused to echo" shows genuine character transformation with visible cost—she gives up escape to become a catalyst for others.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lys transforms from courtesan to awakener, with visible cost in her "blood and dew" footprints. The closure lands cleanly as the city awakens to "raw, alarming serenity," though the early orientation could be slightly clearer regarding the exact nature of the "lullaby of conformity" threat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and silver courtyard function as active constraints—the sanctuary's "faceted quartz" walls and "plinth carved with bodily poetic" directly enable the unlocking ritual. Setting transforms causally from frozen courtyard to blooming garden with "night-blooming cereus," with each environmental change marking story progression and the final "glowing silhouettes" charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal liberation to collective awakening, with the midnight deadline creating urgency ("eternal obedience by dawn"). The cost manifests physically in Lys's "blood and dew" footprints and her choice to forfeit escape, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between personal freedom and collective responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of "echoes" from stolen memories to awakening catalysts, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of citizens filling hollow statues with light offers a non-literal answer about collective liberation versus individual escape, with Lys's choice to remain "chaste...by choice" reweighting the opening's forced chastity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift into elevated register ("arterial red," "pelvic bones") that slightly strains the POV's established voice. The perceptual signature is distinctive in how Lys experiences the sanctuary's chord vibrating "in her pelvic bones," maintaining embodied perspective throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "snow melted into spring water that reflected starlight like shattered mirrors" show controlled imagery, but repetitive constructions appear ("Between sigh and smile" used three times) and some purple prose accumulates in descriptive passages. The prose achieves propulsion in action sequences but occasionally overwrites with stacked modifiers ("raw, alarming serenity").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a courtesan stealing and weaponizing memories as "crystalline threads" offers fresh synthesis, with the mad weaver's teaching that "every obligation is a knot waiting for fingernails" providing original insight. The transformation from enforced performance to chosen awakening avoids predictable liberation narratives.</comment>
