I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Inferred Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through pattern accumulation and image density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lys's choice to remain transforms the city's consciousness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lys's transformation from contracted courtesan to "first voice that refused to echo" tracks clearly with embodied contradiction ("pulse feel like betrayal"). The choice to remain rather than escape with the weaver demonstrates earned agency. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("freedom, too, can be a terrifying lullaby") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration - the city awakens to "raw, alarming serenity" with visible collective transformation. The accumulative structure coheres through echo-memory braiding to dissolution. Deducted for slight orientation delay (sanctuary's purpose unclear until mid-piece) and some causality softness around how exactly the prism's destruction triggers citywide awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains through "statues wearing frost like lace veils" to "hollow centers where hearts had been removed by law." The sanctuary as "frozen teardrop" with "veins of silver" creates visceral architecture. Strong finish with "garden of glowing silhouettes that swayed like kelp" charging the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Central stake (breaking conformity's hold) established early and deepens through echo-harvest to prism-core revelation. The cost materializes in "prints of blood and dew" and choosing to remain. Missing sharper mid-story tightening - the weaving process feels procedural rather than pressurized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery without moralizing - "every obligation is a knot waiting for fingernails." The final collective awakening where citizens fill hollow statues with light resonates thematically. Strong subtext in Lys remaining "chaste, not by contract but by choice," reframing agency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("between sigh and smile" as temporal anchor). Some register elevation in peak moments ("arterial red," "iambs") fits the heightened reality. Deducted for occasional drift into abstract philosophizing that weakens immediacy ("alarming serenity that made every citizen taste their own pulse").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong imagery ("mercury tears into tiny stars that orbited her throat"). However, multiple template patterns emerge: "Between sigh and smile" repetition, abstract concept-stacking ("collective awakening," "conduit rather than commodity"), and some purple drift ("kelp in an invisible tide"). Filter-verb clustering in middle section dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan-as-revolutionary with memory-as-currency creates non-obvious angle. The "harvest of echoes" concept and prism sanctuary feel specific. Some derivative elements (chosen one liberating conformist society) but transformed through bodily poetic and sensory specificity.</comment>
