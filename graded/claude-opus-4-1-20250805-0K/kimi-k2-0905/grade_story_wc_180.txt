<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's contradictory impulses act through concrete choices—barring elders despite needing funds, using sacred items for practical grafting. The daughter relationship crystallizes values through the ribbon's transformation. Minor deduction for some expository interiority ("promises are leaves") that edges toward therapy-speak in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the ribbon's transformation from wage-token to living banner creating genuine Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost (years of tending, ribbon absorbed into bark). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of daughter's arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid setting directly constrains choices—rafters determine climbing routes, absent rose window provides necessary light, graft location matters. The ribbon-as-pendulum between plum boughs uses micro-setting brilliantly. Environment charges the final image of petals snowing across the nave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulation works—from broken contract to reading scroll-vows to grafting to barring elders. The ribbon's transformation and seven-day vigil show genuine cost. Slightly mechanical progression in middle section with convenient fig-scrolls reduces organicity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the deciduous vow metaphor and generational wisdom without direct statement until earned moments. The final "photosynthesize into hope" and covenant imagery resonates. Minor deduction for "promises are leaves" explanation that briefly edges toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive compounds ("quartz-eye," "leaf litter and loam") and consistent perceptual signature focused on botanical/architectural fusion. Strong rhythmic control especially in descriptive passages. Dialogue minimal but effective when present ("I persist, you persist").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"boots crunching on plaster saints" establishes decay while advancing movement. Some figurative density in places ("deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean prose overall with strong sentence variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion is genuinely fresh, as is the quartz-eye mender profession and fig-scrolls containing vows. The ribbon's evolution from wage to pendulum to living graft shows exceptional synthesis. Risk-taking with the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
