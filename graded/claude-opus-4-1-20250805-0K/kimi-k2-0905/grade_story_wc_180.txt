I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds pressure through layered imagery and metaphor rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's motivation to heal despite breach emerges through embodied action (climbing with ribbon between goggles, muttering curses) and the contradiction between her vow to tend and the city's abandonment. The final choice to let the orchard decide when to forgive shows earned agency with visible cost—barring elders with a pruning hook.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the ribbon rots into bark, releasing "coconut and copper" fragrance as an "unspoken covenant." The accumulative design coheres through fig/scroll/pollen/graft imagery building to generational transfer. Cost appears in "deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves" and the daughter inheriting the role. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard setting actively constrains choices—she must climb crumbling stairs, work in rafters, graft where lightning scarred. "Branches wove tracery finer than any mason's dream" and "roots coiled around corbels" create specific architectural pressure. The rose window's absence stripes light across the workspace, affecting visibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the breach forcing desperate measures (opening forbidden pouch), the fig revealing scrolls of vows, and the seven-day vigil before the daughter arrives. The mender's choice to bar the elders shows agency foreclosing reconciliation "until the orchard would decide." Cost is visible in the ribbon's sacrifice and generational transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor: "Promises are leaves; they must fall so the tree notices its own rings." The ribbon's transformation from daughter's hair ornament to living banner to compost resonates without stating a moral. "Deciduous vows compost into stronger roots" reweights the initial breach as necessary renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-botanical register ("cambium thrumming," "photosynthesize into hope") with controlled compression. "Endearingly feisty" characterization emerges through action (barring doors with pruning hook). Some elevated diction ("deciduous vows," "accidental wisdom") fits the fabulist mode though occasionally strains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density works mostly well with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots crunching on plaster saints"). However, abstract constructions weaken momentum: "time persisting like sap in winter: slow, unwilling to forgive" and "photosynthesize into hope" strain metaphor coherence. Template phrase "Years later, when the girl became" signals predictable transition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical grafting with contract law and generational wisdom offers fresh ground. "Quartz-eye mender" as profession and the specific detail of scrolls preserved in fig pectin show originality. The piece commits to its extended metaphor of organic versus legal contracts, though the resolution tends toward expected reconciliation.</comment>
