<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's choice to give away the gear shows genuine internal conflict and cost, with the transformation into a tree representing earned renunciation. The "distributed" insight and acceptance of translocation as identity erosion creates authentic contradiction. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the internal journey lacking more visceral embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the final transformation into the mechanical banyan tree serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—she loses individual identity to become part of the forest's teaching system. The pattern of trees/rhythms (3/4, 5/8, 7/8) accumulates meaningfully toward the closure where she becomes one of these teaching nodes. Slight deduction for the mercury brook sequence feeling somewhat disconnected from the main accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest functions as both setting and constraint, with specific tree rhythms (banyan 3/4, teak 5/8) actively teaching and transforming the protagonist. The copper canopy, steam-breathing banyan, and mercury brook create vivid sensory anchoring while the setting's transformation of the protagonist at closure (becoming a tree herself) demonstrates exceptional integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The escalation from passive translocation to active choice (giving away the gear) to final transformation shows clear deepening under the Accumulative lens. The jaguar's demand creates genuine pressure with visible cost—losing the gear means "forget her name entirely." Minor deduction as the middle section with reflections could have built more tangible pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of distribution versus rootedness emerges organically through the gear/translocation system, culminating in "You are not lost; you are distributed." The final image of becoming a teaching tree that helps future philosophers "unravel" reweights the entire journey without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the trade-off between certainty and wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm—"boots dangling from a vine of coaxial cable, pockets empty except for one small gear warm as a sparrow." The polymetric tree teaching (3/4, 5/8, 7/8) demonstrates purposeful patterning. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("probable miracles stitched from chlorophyll and chrome") that doesn't fully integrate with the philosophical wanderer voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The mechanical banyan sighed in binary, its trunk exhaling steam that spelled probable miracles." Some repetition of "probable miracles" and "hum of insight" phrases, plus occasional overwriting in metaphor density ("cyclone of leaves and numbers"). The prose maintains momentum despite these minor loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest as a place where philosophy becomes physical transformation is genuinely fresh—trees teach in time signatures, philosophers become part of the teaching system. The synthesis of organic/mechanical, certainty/wonder, and individual/distributed consciousness creates non-obvious resonance. Risk-taking in the surreal premise heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3).</comment>
