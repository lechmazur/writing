<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that drives her descent into the mirror chamber, with embodied stress ("counting each breath as she used to count seconds in locked closets"). The final choice to take the key despite knowing it will seal the tunnels behind her demonstrates earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Arin's acceptance of the spatial mutiny and her transformation from fearing enclosed spaces to carrying "the mutiny inside her." However, the cost of permanently sealing the tunnels feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt in the final moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nexus setting actively constrains choice through its warping geometry and the spiral shaft that triggers Arin's claustrophobia. The compass point creating a "perfect black circle" that opens the hidden chamber demonstrates setting as mechanism rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around finding the key where "echoes mutiny against the ear," with the organ's impossible presence creating spatial distortion. While the stakes tighten when Arin must descend despite her claustrophobia, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off beyond accepting internal change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of rebellion against one's own limitations emerges organically through Arin's confrontation with her claustrophobia and the spatial mutiny itself. The final image of her carrying "the mutiny inside her" reweights the opening's "fallow period" without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical precision ("the sky forgot its colors," "iron night felt denser than stone") and controlled psychic distance that tightens during the descent. The perceptual signature remains consistent through stress, though some passages edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("The silence was so total that she heard her pulse rattling like loose rolling stock"). Some figurative density in non-pressure beats but clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of spatial mutiny as both external phenomenon and internal transformation offers fresh synthesis. The mirrors showing Arin at different ages while she claims the key creates an original moment of self-confrontation tied to the story's core tension.</comment>
