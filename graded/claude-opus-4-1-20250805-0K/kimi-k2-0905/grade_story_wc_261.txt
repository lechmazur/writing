I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern breaks rather than strict causality, with closure arriving through density increase and cadence shift.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("tasting iron and lilac," blood as syllables). The protagonist's motivation to release the miracle by reopening wounds shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("to seek closure") early on, though the embodied complexity at closure compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the wound closes "not into a question mark but into a period" with visible cost (blood offering, scar reopening). The accumulative lens holds through layered imagery (hourglass/coffee rings/tunnel). Orientation anchors arrive timely. Cost is legible in the blood exchange and transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint through the tower's vertical architecture, stone that "softened into loam," and plants with telepathic connection. The coffee rings become a spatial portal. Environment directly enables the descent and transformation, though some descriptions remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the deepening realization that releasing the miracle requires "fresh loss" and reopening the wound. The protagonist's agency drives the blood offering and acceptance of cost. One meaningful tightening when the trade requirement is revealed, narrowing options to sacrifice or abandonment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of scars from "stories written sideways" to readable text. The seed swallowing and final commission to "teach the silence to speak kindly" offers resonant non-literal answer. No explicit moralizing; the wound's transformation from question to period reweights all prior imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("meteor hush," "tannic grooves"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to botanical and medical details. Minor register elevation in places but maintains coherence through the pressure points.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied syntax. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("vertebra in the spine of memory") and occasional template phrasing ("I understood"). Information density high in most beats. The "meteor hush" repetition works as pattern but some figurative language feels strained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of body horror, botanical telepathy, and temporal manipulation through specific details (osage sapling, coffee ring portal). The concept of trading wounds for miracles and scars as sideways stories shows originality. Risk-taking in the lyrical descent sequence pays off, though some elements feel familiar.</comment>
