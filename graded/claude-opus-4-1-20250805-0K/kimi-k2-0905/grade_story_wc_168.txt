<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction between guilt and the need to speak is embodied through concrete actions (swallowing ash, crying, drawing the spiral). The transformation from silence to commissioning feels earned through the dramatized ritual, though some emotional transitions rely on abstract language ("hard softness") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias transforms from carrying silent guilt to becoming commissioned to speak. The cost is visible (tears, the permanent scar-spiral tattoo) and the ritual creates a before/after shift. Minor orientation wobble with "three years ago" flashback interrupts present momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path and granite altar constrain and enable Elias's ritual choices effectively. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (pine smell of burn, moonlight pooling, warmth of porcelain), though some descriptions edge toward symbolic convenience. The setting actively participates in the transformation through moonlight projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming guilt into communicable wisdom—escalates through the ritual sequence with visible cost (swallowing ash, crying, marking himself). The bargain's terms create persistent constraint, though the peak moment relies more on symbolic accumulation than active pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete ritual of transforming ash to ink to spiral—pain becoming language others can read "without burning." The final sprout image offers non-literal resonance, though phrases like "universal language" and "hard softness" occasionally announce rather than embody the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on fire/burn imagery. Some elevated diction ("celestial bodies performed their slow dance") occasionally drifts from Elias's working-class firefighter lexicon, and filter constructions accumulate in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("moonlit ridge path wound like a silver scar") but suffers from occasional redundancy ("hard softness" appears multiple times) and elevated register that strains naturalism. Information density is generally high, though some metaphors edge toward purple prose in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ritual transformation of ash to ink to spiral-tattoo offers a fresh synthesis of grief processing. The specific detail of the firefighter's guilt and physical scarring grounds what could be abstract, though the "translate pain into universal language" concept relies on familiar therapeutic frameworks.</comment>
