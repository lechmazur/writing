<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's journey from inherited shame to self-determination reads through concrete embodied choices (touching the lattice, speaking to walls, playing the pipe). The forgiveness declaration "I forgive the silence, but I will not become it" crystallizes internal contradiction effectively, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the echo is a cell with no door"). Minor deduction for occasional therapy-speak but the closure choice lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught magical realism paying off in the tower's inversion and field transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas steps onto a "labyrinth traced in light rather than stone," inverting his inheritance with felt cost (leaving the prison-world behind). Minor orientation delay (lighthouse prison context emerges gradually) but serves the dreamlike progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, reef, and transforming labyrinth constrain choices throughout—Silas must speak to progress, the mirror-water forces confrontation with memory, the iron lattice becomes both shield and eventual flowering vine. The copperlight imagery threads from dusk to "dawn that sustained itself without sun," charging the final transformation. Setting literally reshapes around protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: each descended step erases behind him, walls demand story-payment, the pipe releases memory that forces reckoning. The stake—escaping inherited silence/lies—tightens when Silas must forgive to transform the space. Cost is visible in the irrevocable leaving of the known world, though the final meadow arrival slightly softens the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of prison to meadow, silence to music, inherited shame to chosen path. The lattice sprouting bells that ring "the hush into something like music" offers a non-literal answer to breaking cycles of deception. Subtext operates in the father's drowned truth becoming Silas's living ink on walls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression ("salt-stung balcony," "copperlight repose") with mythic register appropriate to fable-like material. Perceptual signature strong in synesthetic moments ("note that tasted of iron and confession"). Controlled psychic distance maintains dreamlike coherence without head-hopping. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The walls drank the words and glowed faint copper"). Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("the hush ahead grew heavier, as though the word had mass") and one template moment, but prose propels effectively through surreal transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth-as-living-text concept freshly synthesizes coming-of-age with magical realism, avoiding stock prison-break or father-son reconciliation templates. The tower inverting itself and the lighthouse relocating to an impossible meadow show genuine imaginative risk. The "cry-wolf" inheritance transformed into truth-telling through physical passage elevates familiar material.</comment>
