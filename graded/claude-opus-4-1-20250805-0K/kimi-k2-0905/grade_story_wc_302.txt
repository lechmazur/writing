<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's motivation crystallizes through her stolen voice and the golden thread sewn mouth—a strong embodied detail that drives her final choice to dissolve into "pure articulation." However, internal conflict reads more as sequential revelation than simultaneous contradiction, and the confidence man remains a label without earned characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the dreamer becomes the library itself, with visible cost (body dissolving) and the cyclically reversed doors sealing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of unspoken words, though some causal linkages between the cipher revelations and her navigation feel asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glowing library's phosphorescent tiles, hungry atmosphere, and shelves that exist in "different temporal phases" effectively constrain navigation and create pressure. The library as living entity that "feeds on words people swallowed" directly shapes the final transformation, though some details (rose-colored silk that bleeds) trend toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking unspoken words to becoming the library itself, with the cyclically reversed cycle creating time pressure. The final transformation carries clear cost (dissolution), but middle beats lack concrete obstacles—she moves through shelves and finds her mother's apology without meaningful resistance or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence emerges through the paradox of speaking the unspoken, culminating in "Thank you for speaking us. Now we exist." The library-as-mouth imagery and the dreamer's sewn-shut mouth create resonant opposition, though some metaphysical assertions ("THE LIBRARY IS THE WORD") edge toward abstract declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("glowing library in mist," "propagation delays") creates atmosphere, but repetitive phrasing weakens control—"between two fateful letters" appears verbatim three times, "propagation delays" four times. The elevated register fits the dreamy tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Template cadence runs plague the prose: "She documented," "The veiled dreamer," "Through propagation delays" create predictable openings. The phrase "glowing library in mist" repeats five times verbatim, and "cyclically reversed" appears four times without variation, creating loop artifacts that dull momentum despite some strong imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a library feeding on unspoken words that requires someone to become it offers genuine freshness. The sewn-mouth prophecy trade and the backward-ticking watch that counts lies show inventive world-building, though the mystical library setting itself follows familiar genre patterns.</comment>
