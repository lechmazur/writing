<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's internal contradictions between cautious pursuit and childhood longing create genuine tension, particularly in moments like unsaying "I am happy" which reveals layered self-deception. Her micro-choices (offering mother's lullaby as payment, seizing the syllable-key despite time snapping) demonstrate values hierarchy under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library collapses into the space between letters. Cost is legible in the lost memory of the lullaby and the restoration of the lie, though the final truncated sentence weakens closure impact slightly (-0.4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library-as-sentence concept where stepping left pronounces vowels and right creates consonants brilliantly constrains movement and choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects the dreamer's priorities (watch's heartbeat, breathing shelves, mercury mirror) while propagation delays create tangible spatial disorientation that shapes her navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating propagation delays (shadow arriving later, watch stuttering, time snapping elastic) that narrow her options toward the final grab. The cost of trading memory for access and having her lie restored demonstrates clear price, though the truncated ending slightly dulls the final pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of documenting unspoken words by speaking none, with the final incomplete message "The library survives in what you choose not to" offering a resonant non-literal answer. The cyclical cipher that erases and reappears mirrors the larger question of what persists through absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through synesthetic descriptions ("light like slow rain," "mirror made of mercury") and the dreamer's selective attention to temporal anomalies. Rhythmic control heightens during pressure moments with shorter, more urgent constructions while maintaining the dreamlike register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines performing multiple functions (world-building + emotional state + plot advancement). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established register ("phosphorescent algae," "propagate delays") but prose remains propulsive with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of magical realism with information theory (propagation delays, cyclically reversed cipher) creates a genuinely fresh angle on the quest-for-forbidden-knowledge trope. Risk-taking in the incomplete final sentence and the library-as-spoken-grammar concept heightens stakes while maintaining clarity (+0.3).</comment>
