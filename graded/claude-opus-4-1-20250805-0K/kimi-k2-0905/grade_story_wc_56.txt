<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to uncover her father's lies drives consistent choices through discovery and renunciation. The internal conflict between inherited myth and salvaged truth plays out through embodied actions (tracing numbers, reading journals). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval" as internal state), but the final choice to dismantle monuments shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of erasure/revelation building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara releases the sundial and commits to monument dismantling. Cost is legible in "felt both lighter and ancient" and the foreclosed path of comfortable myth. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "who" (Mara's identity emerges gradually).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canal, barge, and bunker create atmospheric pressure and constrain movement effectively. Sensory detail like "gold ellipses on the water" and "reedy cut" grounds the journey. The sundial's coordinate discovery uses setting as discovery mechanism. Deduction for some abstract descriptions ("scar trying to heal") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes of understanding father's lies intensify through log discoveries to journal revelation, with meaningful deepening when coordinate leads to bunker. The cost lands in Mara's transformation from "legend seeker" to active dismantler. Minor deduction because the external pressure (Riga, canal journey) could more directly complicate Mara's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of inherited lies emerges through concrete discoveries (altered logs, hidden coordinates, buried journals) without explicit moralizing. The final image of dismantling monuments "beam by beam" offers resonant answer to how truth confronts myth. Strong subtext in the sundial's transformation from relic to burden to released weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with literary compression ("morning radio silence," "palimpsests of altered routes"). POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual filter consistent. Some elevated diction ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies") occasionally strains but serves thematic purpose. Dialogue minimal but effective (Riga's cigarette-smoke communication).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied syntax, but "serene upheaval" appears three times creating mild repetition. Some abstract phrasing ("scaffolding she now knew how to dismantle") could be more concrete. The prose generally propels forward with purposeful rhythm shifts between discovery and reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war memory, inherited trauma, and archaeological metaphor for truth-seeking. The barge journey as vehicle for historical reckoning feels specific. The image of monuments trembling from spoken truth during "morning radio silence" offers non-obvious resolution. Some familiar elements (hidden war crimes) but transformed through Mara's particular lens.</comment>
