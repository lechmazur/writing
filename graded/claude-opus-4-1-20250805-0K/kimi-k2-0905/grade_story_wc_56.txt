<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from seeking truth about her father's lies to becoming a truth-teller herself is well-motivated with concrete details like the sundial's tooth marks contradicting his story. The transformation is earned through specific discoveries (the journals confessing his orchestrated ambush), though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed in places like "felt both lighter and ancient."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered discoveries (sundial coordinates, altered logbooks, buried journals) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara transforms from seeker to dismantler of lies. The cost is visible in her leaving the sundial behind and choosing a new mission. Minor orientation wobble with "twilight barge canal" as an opening location.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The barge canal setting effectively constrains movement and creates atmosphere ("fog pooled between iron walls"), with specific details like the reedy cut and half-submerged bunker. The sundial functions as micro-setting that drives discovery. Some passages lean toward atmospheric description over constraint ("gold ellipses on the water").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal truth-seeking to systemic dismantling of false histories, with meaningful tightening when Mara discovers her father sacrificed another platoon. The cost is legible in her choice to abandon the sundial and take on a larger mission. One clear deepening that changes knowledge suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "architecture of lies" motif that transforms from personal investigation to public mission. The final image of Mara moving forward without the sundial while the wake spreads "like a sentence spoken at last" resonates without stating a moral. Slight dock for "serene upheaval do its patient work" edging toward theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical language ("the canal as nothing more than a scar trying to heal") and consistent POV. Some register elevation in places ("palimpsests of altered routes") that slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon. Dialogue minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("morning radio—that hush between the last love song and the shipping forecast"). Some density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in "She asked... She read... She traced" sequence mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of reading erased truth through physical traces (sundial marks, smudged ink, wax-sealed journals) offers a fresh angle on the war-secrets narrative. The transformation feels somewhat expected given the setup, though specific details like the coordinate discovery provide originality.</comment>
