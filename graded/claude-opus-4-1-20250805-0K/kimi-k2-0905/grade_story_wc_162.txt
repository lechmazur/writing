<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Juniper's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail—barefoot reading of floorboards, pressing the logbook to her chest—with internal contradictions acting simultaneously (searching for father's message while knowing he's gone). The final choice to step into "necessary distance" carries visible cost through the dissolution of the maze, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("the space between heartbeats").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught recursion (growth rings as weather codes, drifting terrace as temporal migration) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Juniper steps into the "necessary distance" with clear cost—losing and finding her father simultaneously. The butterfly effect's causal chain from plane deviation to maze transformation provides persistent constraint, though the final dissolution could be more viscerally rendered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (three inches west per year determining Juniper's trajectory) and the wooden grain becomes a readable map directing action. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV priorities—tactile over visual—though some descriptions drift toward abstraction ("air thick with memory") rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering father's encoded message about thresholds) deepens through accumulation: from reading logbook to decoding table notches to stepping off the terrace edge. The butterfly effect provides persistent constraint shaping all subsequent mazes, though the final "necessary distance" resolution, while thematically resonant, could use more concrete opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the threshold concept—"where two stories touched"—with the recurring motif of reading weather in wood constraining choices throughout. The final image of necessary distance reweights all prior searching without stating a moral, achieving resonance through accumulated particulars rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through selective attention to grain patterns and architectural memory, with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the threshold crossing. Some register elevation occurs ("fractured hush," "between-place") but remains consistent with the lyrical mode taught early through "drifting prism terrace."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions (setting/character/theme), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the space between heartbeats," "air thick with memory"). Minor paraphrase loop between "necessary distances" iterations, but propulsion maintains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph lengths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn maze architecture with temporal physics creates non-obvious premise, with the butterfly effect's transformation of agricultural patterns into time-navigation showing genuine ingenuity. The concept of reading weather codes in wood grain offers specific innovation, though some emotional beats follow familiar loss/discovery patterns.</comment>
