<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to transform silence into incomplete music is grounded in her acoustic sensitivity and grandmother's legacy, with concrete embodied details like the violin "wobbling on purpose." The choice to leave the bowl humming in the dirt shows genuine renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "beauty in the unfinished" that edges toward thesis-speak rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Mara deliberately refuses completion, transforming the family tradition from bonfire gatherings to solitary unfinished music. The cost is legible in her walking away from the bowl/seedling setup. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse environment actively constrains and enables choices - the ash-slick mud, broken panes creating "minor sevenths," and shipwreck acoustics all shape Mara's musical decisions. The makeshift wire bridge transforms the bowl into a resonator, showing environment as active participant. Setting charges the final image of the greenhouse "breathing unfinished music."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming the "chronic hush" through incomplete music, with one meaningful deepening when Mara realizes "beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation." The cost appears in her leaving the bowl behind and walking away. Escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of incompleteness and invitation, with the wire bridge literally manifesting the concept. The grandmother's bowl surviving fire connects to artistic endurance. The ending offers a non-literal answer about beginnings requiring endings to remain open, though "vast, simple magnificence" edges toward elevated declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with Mara hearing condensation as "minor seventh begging resolution" and the greenhouse teaching "how to let go" through flattening echoes. Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression. Minor rhythmic monotony in some passages but strong control during the musical sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity like "brittle ribs of orchids" and "sky wore the color of old pennies." Some elevated register drift ("vast, simple magnificence") and occasional abstract phrasing ("beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation") that could be more grounded. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of environmental destruction and musical incompleteness, with the specific detail of using shipwreck wire to create a resonator showing genuine ingenuity. The transformation of family tradition from communal bonfire to solitary incompleteness offers a non-obvious angle. The piece commits fully to its premise of unfinished beauty.</comment>
