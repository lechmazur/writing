<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's internal contradiction between duty and dissolution is embodied through concrete actions like pressing against obsidian for anchor and the loosening grip on reality that becomes mercy. The final choice to eventually dissolve into stone carries visible cost—the erasure of witness itself. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "regenerative silence" that could be more physically grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through library details and marginalia breeding histories, culminating in Earned Stasis where she accepts eventual dissolution. Cost is legible in "the map would dissolve into dust" and becoming "merely another stone." Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the burrow mechanism arrives late without clear setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge and overgrown library constrain choices—she must return to this specific spot for coherence, must navigate rearranging corridors. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "moss that had learned to grow in darkness by feeding on abandoned footnotes." The recurring swan's paper thinning shapes the final image of inevitable dissolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on maintaining witness versus surrendering to dissolution, with one meaningful deepening as she realizes her loose grip is "mercy" not decay. The origami swan's wearing paper creates escalating pressure toward the inevitable end. Cost is clear but the middle section meanders through description without tightening options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between recording and forgetting, with the final image of becoming stone offering a non-literal answer about witness as burden. "To witness change without judgment" recurs but earns its weight through the predecessor's teaching and her eventual acceptance. Slight deduction for one instance of explicit thematic statement that could trust the imagery more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "shelves arched like whale ribs," "leather cover soft as eyelids." Voice modulates effectively from lyrical observation to matter-of-fact recording of mercury floods and cinnamon-rust languages. Consistent third-person limited with no head-hopping, though occasional filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("silver scab over the wound of daylight"), with high information density and varied syntax. Some repetitive phrasing around "regenerative silence" and "cryptic folds" creates minor loops. The unfinished final sentence works as intentional truncation matching the theme of incompletion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a chronicle keeper whose loosening grip on reality becomes mercy offers fresh perspective on the witness-recorder trope. Specific details like "marginalia that multiplied when unobserved" and "villages that walked on stilted roots" create originality through particulars. The synthesis of duty and dissolution feels earned rather than clever.</comment>
