I'll evaluate this literary story according to the demanding editorial standards provided.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern recognition, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Mara transforms the prism into distributed healing light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization succeeds through concrete particulars (ankle-deep stance, reading water patterns) and embodied ritual. Her transformation from private communion to public healing shows genuine agency. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "noctilucent reckonings" and "debts of beauty" that edges toward label-speak without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the prism dissolves into healing light across town windows. The accumulative structure coheres through water rings expanding to memory, then to spoken acknowledgment, then to distributed transformation. Deduction for some opacity around "noctilucent reckonings" and the mechanical inventory metaphor that doesn't fully integrate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions beautifully as constraint and enabler - the dawn timing creates urgency, the harbor's "black mirror" enables the reading ritual, and specific anchors (Pearl Bay, abandoned lighthouse, baker's skylight) ground the fantastical. The prism's transformation from singular object to distributed presence elevates the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation: from private communion to reading the bay's message to speaking aloud to hurling the prism. Each ring reveals deeper personal history (mother's teacup, stranger's harmonica, own scar) that Mara must acknowledge. The final act costs her the prism but gains communal healing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central action of finding "quiet radiance" in damaged things. The teacup/harmonica/scar trinity builds to the prism's sacrifice, transforming private vision into public grace. The ending reweights mundane damage as potential for light without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with distinctive texture ("storms slid off them like apologies," "gulls began their riot"). Perceptual signature strong through Mara's glazier expertise informing how she sees light and fracture. Some elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings") occasionally strains but mostly serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. However, several issues accumulate: "prism atrium in mist" appears twice without clear meaning, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("debts of beauty unpaid"), and occasional overwriting in metaphor density. The final third recovers with cleaner, more propulsive language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glazier-as-light-reader concept offers fresh specificity, and the ritual of reading water rings to catalog damaged beauty feels original. The transformation of personal practice into communal healing through distributed light creates a non-obvious synthesis. Some elements feel workshopped but the core vision coheres.</comment>
