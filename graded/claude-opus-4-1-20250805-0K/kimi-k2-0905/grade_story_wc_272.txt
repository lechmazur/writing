<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's grief-driven obsession and artistic desperation create consistent motivation throughout, with concrete embodied details like "feeling it pulse like a dying heart" and the tactile interaction with tarot fragments. The final choice to step through the mirror into dissolution is earned through accumulated loss, though some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing ("Is absence the purest pigment"). Internal contradiction acts simultaneously in his desperate search versus acceptance of destruction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward closure, where Elian's dissolution into "necessary darkness" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("salt sealed his eyes"). The lighthouse's progressive collapse provides structural pressure, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated. Who/where/when anchored early ("forgotten library inside a lighthouse"), and the pattern of rhetorical questions serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The collapsing lighthouse functions as both setting and pressure mechanism, with vivid sensory detail ("walls exhaling mildewed breath that tasted of shipwrecked letters"). Environment actively constrains choices through physical contraction and deterioration. The mirror and tarot fragments serve as micro-settings that enable the final transformation, charging the closure image of "endless spiral."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (painting the lost beloved's face) established early and pressure tightens through the lighthouse's progressive collapse, forcing Elian's final choice. The accumulative pressure of disintegration—books toppling, walls pressing, foundation crumbling—creates escalation consistent with the textural lens. Cost is legible in the final dissolution, though agency feels more like surrender than active choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of art's relationship to loss and fragmentation emerges through concrete images rather than statement, with the tarot's broken pieces mirroring Elian's fractured grief. The final question "Does art end where the world begins, or does the world end where art begins?" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior material. Subtext operates through the recurring rhetorical questions and the lighthouse-as-psyche metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV, using rhetorical questions as a perceptual signature ("If memory is a coastline, why does every tide redraw the borders of her mouth?"). Some register elevation feels forced ("luminescent ache migrate from card to chest"), but the lyric compression serves the accumulative design. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures support the dreamlike progression, but several instances of overwriting diminish clarity: "luminescent ache" appears twice, mixed metaphors ("paper wings flutter" for cards), and abstract philosophizing that dulls momentum ("redesign the very grammar of seeing"). Template repetition of rhetorical questions, while pattern-taught, becomes predictable. Information density is high when concrete but lapses into abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-consciousness with tarot fragmentation offers a fresh angle on grief and artistic creation, with the final image of art as drowning particularly memorable. The recursive structure of rhetorical questions creates distinctive texture, though some metaphysical abstraction feels derivative. The commitment to dissolution rather than resolution takes genuine risk.</comment>
