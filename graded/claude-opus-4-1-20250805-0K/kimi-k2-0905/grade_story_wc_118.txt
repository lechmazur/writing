I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered discoveries and resonant imagery rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The historian's sensitivity to "narratives trapped in stone" and her methodical discovery process create consistent motivation. Her final transformation—becoming "the displaced axis she sought"—is earned through accumulated revelations, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("bronze quiet replacing the hollow where longing had been").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the historian trades "her final solitude for a world that would spin around the hush of reclaimed places." The three diary discoveries accumulate textural pressure, each deepening the axis metaphor, with visible cost in her transformation. Orientation anchors (historian, silo library, post-human world) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silo library functions as both setting and participant—its concrete walls receive the tapestry's dragons, transforming into a new axis. Sensory detail ("air tasted of cooled ember and graphite," "copper glow") creates atmosphere while the spiral architecture shapes her journey. The environment literally absorbs and transforms meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from collecting stories to understanding the "displaced axis" to becoming it herself. Each diary reveals deeper layers (breathing dragons→loose stone→fire as door), though the pressure remains contemplative rather than urgent. The final cost—surrendering individual identity—lands clearly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The axis metaphor evolves brilliantly from abstract concept to physical reality to personal transformation. The tapestry dragons transferring into the silo's walls offers a non-literal answer to how stories persist in architecture. The ending reweights all prior discoveries without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("the way a tuning fork feels after the last note has gone"). Perceptual signature shows in how she reads objects—feeling walls, probing with sable brush. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("bronze quiet," "copper glow") but serve the textural design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information-dense prose where most lines advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. Some figurative density in emotional beats ("axis settle under her sternum") and occasional abstraction ("bronze quiet replacing the hollow"), but the lyric mode earns this compression. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a post-human archivist reading stories embedded in architecture offers fresh perspective. The three diaries create an elegant accumulative structure, each adding texture to the axis metaphor. The transformation—historian becoming the world's new center—feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
