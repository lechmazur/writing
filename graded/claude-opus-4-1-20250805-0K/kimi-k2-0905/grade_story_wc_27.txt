<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stargazer's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete actions (climbing the crane, activating the shuttle), with her "awkward confidence" embodied through physical choices rather than labels. Internal conflict between witnessing/acting resolves through the stone circle's call, though the transformation from passive observer to active catalyst could use more intermediate resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and resonant images build toward the shuttle launch, with the stone circle's awakening providing causal linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she broadcasts the lullaby to crack curfews below, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spaceport setting actively constrains and enables choices—the crane becomes instrument, the shuttle awaits revival, the stone circle beneath provides the transformative frequency. Sensory hierarchy reflects the stargazer's priorities (feeling vibrations through bare feet, tracking light through opera glasses), with environment and body functioning as integrated setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal observation to planetary liberation as the stone circle's hum transforms her from witness to catalyst. The tightening occurs when she must choose between escape and broadcasting the lullaby, though the rebellion context could pressure her decision more concretely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the synthesis of ancient stone and abandoned technology, with the lullaby bridging temporal scales. The ending reweights "thunderous serenity" as revolutionary act rather than passive peace, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("rebellion's lull had never been surrender").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression with concrete action, using compound constructions ("barefoot stargazer," "ferrocrete") and synesthetic perception ("soles tasting dust"). POV remains controlled with selective attention to resonant details, though occasional register elevation ("constellation of boycotted departures") slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere), though some metaphoric density in peak beats approaches oversaturation ("plasma flowers bloomed"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure, with minor template cadence in the climbing sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis combines space-age abandonment with ancient stone circles, transforming the rebellion story through unexpected mystical-technological fusion. The specific detail of opera glasses found in a fuel line and the concept of broadcasting a lullaby as revolution show genuine invention beyond template dystopia.</comment>
