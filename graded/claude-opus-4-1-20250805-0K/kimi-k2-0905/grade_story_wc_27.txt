<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stargazer's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—bare soles "tasting dust," the hum climbing through her body, culminating in decisive action to broadcast the lullaby. Internal contradiction lives in "awkwardly confident" and the tension between discovering versus manufacturing meaning. The final choice to return rather than escape shows earned character growth with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the stone circle's hum building from vibration to song to shuttle ignition, creating Resonant Reconfiguration. The stargazer's transformation from passive observer to active broadcaster reweights the rebellion's lull as gathering breath. Cost is legible in "promise to return with skies reopened"—she sacrifices immediate escape for collective liberation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spaceport setting constrains and enables brilliantly—from cracked ferrocrete tasting departure's dust to the decommissioned fuel crane becoming a tuning fork. The stone circle beneath adds mythic depth while opera glasses split sunlight to ignite the shuttle. Every spatial element participates in the final transformation, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal stargazing to collective liberation as the hum crescendos and the stargazer realizes she's "the exhale" of rebellion's held breath. The dominant stake—keeping skies open for future dreamers—tightens when she chooses broadcasting over escape. Agency drives every turn from climbing the crane to inputting harmonic frequencies as destination.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of "Remember, Reclaim, Reignite" with the lullaby becoming resistance art that's "too beautiful to jam." The final image of the shuttle "trailing song instead of fire" while "curfews cracked" below offers resonant answer to discovering meaning in mess. Subtext operates through the stone circle's ancient presence challenging technological oppression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines lyrical density ("bruise-colored sky," "peppercorns flung into blue soup") with technical precision ("harmonic frequency as destination"). POV control remains tight with selective perception—swallows become ships, nests become galaxies. Some elevated diction ("thunderous serenity") occasionally strains but serves the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and rhythm, though occasional density clusters ("shuddered, pressurized, and opened") and elevated register ("cathedral of thunderous serenity") create minor friction. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. The unfinished final sentence reads as intentional ellipsis suggesting continuation rather than error.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rebellion-as-music with ancient stone circles beneath spaceports creates non-obvious resonance. The opera glasses splitting light to ignite shuttles and inputting harmonic frequencies as navigation coordinates show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the mythic-technological blend and unfinished ending heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
