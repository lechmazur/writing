<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to solve grief through mathematical precision is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like "recited primes under my breath, 2, 3, 5, 7" showing internal conflict. The final choice to move forward "gently inventive" despite ambiguous loss shows earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotion as "locus of possible intersections" that briefly slips into conceptual language rather than staying fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the orchard's renewal and protagonist's acceptance of approaching the limit of loss rather than solving it completely. The glass eyes triggering the mosaic's opening provides causal linkage, and the cost is felt in "ambiguous loss remained—no body, no farewell." The orientation anchors (cavern orchard, conjurer, ten harvests ago) establish context efficiently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard setting actively constrains and enables choices—the glass eyes must be placed in the tree fork, the astrolabe points to specific stalactites, and the mosaic stepping stone's turquoise patterns directly participate in the resolution. Sensory details like "each drip a note in the arithmetic of delight" and "small white seedlings sprouted, roots threading the air" create vivid specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding grief through mathematical logic deepens when the protagonist realizes "emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections," forcing acceptance of ambiguity. The escalation from silence to single drop to renewed music shows clear progression. Cost is visible in accepting the master will never return while carrying forward his teaching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of mathematical grief—"Grief is an unknown variable; solve for motion, not for stillness." The ending offers a non-literal answer as the protagonist accepts approaching the limit rather than solving completely. The recurring mathematics/emotion synthesis feels earned through specific actions like aligning glass eyes with spiral origins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with mathematical perception ("vectors of longing," "the mathematics of emotion") that remains consistent throughout. Some elevated diction like "locus of possible intersections" occasionally strains but mostly serves the conjurer's scholarly perspective. The perceptual signature of seeing emotion through mathematical lens is maintained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, though occasional abstract phrasing ("locus of possible intersections," "arithmetic of delight") borders on purple prose. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of mathematical logic with grief processing offers a fresh angle on loss narratives. The specific detail of glass taxidermist eyes opening a mosaic stone feels inventive rather than derivative. The commitment to the mathematical metaphor throughout shows conceptual integrity, though it doesn't quite achieve breakthrough originality.</comment>
