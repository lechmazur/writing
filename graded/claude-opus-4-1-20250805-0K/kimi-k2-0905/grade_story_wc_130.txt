<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-driven quest to solve emotional absence through mathematical metaphor creates compelling internal contradiction. The final choice to harvest seedlings and step forward "gently inventive" shows earned transformation through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections") that edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the glass eyes triggering mosaic opening, astrolabe discovery, and orchard renewal—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("ambiguous loss remained"). The pattern of mathematical grief finding motion through ritual action lands cleanly. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally dramatized in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with petrified trunks and stalactites creates atmospheric pressure that directly enables the discovery sequence. The mosaic stepping stone's turquoise spiral constrains the protagonist's actions meaningfully. Deduction for some abstract descriptors ("algebra of the cavern") that don't fully embody the space's tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from silence/stillness through glass eye placement, mosaic opening, astrolabe discovery, to seedling harvest—each deepening the emotional mathematics metaphor. The protagonist's agency drives each transformation. However, the absence of true opposition or reversal limits the pressure; the orchard simply "withdraws" then responds to the right input.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mathematical approach to grief emerges organically through concrete actions—counting drops, reciting primes, following vectors. The final image of stepping into the desert "wide as an unsolved problem" offers resonant non-literal answer to processing loss. Minor deduction for the slightly over-explicit "emotion is not a number" realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges mathematical precision with lyrical imagery ("coat of starling feathers," "liquid starlight"). The perceptual signature of seeing grief through equations and geometry remains consistent. Some elevated diction ("fossilized apple tree whose fruit rang softly") occasionally strains against the conjurer's practical worldview.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specifics ("brass astrolabe etched with our shared calculations"). Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("interval between drop and stone") and some repetitive phrasing around mathematical concepts that borders on template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-equation with conjurer-as-solver offers fresh angle on loss narratives. The specific detail of glass taxidermy eyes opening stone petals feels genuinely inventive. Slight deduction for relying on familiar magical realism tropes (mysterious master, enchanted orchard) without sufficient transformation.</comment>
