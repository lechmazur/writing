I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tattooist's guilt manifests through concrete embodied details (static crackling in chest, burning collarbone stars) and drives meaningful choices. The final renunciation—choosing RELEASE INSECT over becoming the lullaby herself—shows contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("promise never delivered") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the tattooist releases the insect, transforming guilt into "meteors burning out" with clear emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds as images (amber, lullaby, constellation) reweight through pattern breaks. Slight dock for the menu's convenience in offering exactly the right choices without prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory setting actively constrains choices through its console interface and glass chambers of trapped sounds. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (drawers opening, paper chain wrapping wrists). The amber insect's transformation into crib mobile charges the final image effectively. Setting functions as more than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: console activation → letters revealing hidden connections → paper chain tethering → final menu choice. The realization that the lab "cultivated" guilt rather than stored sounds provides meaningful tightening. Cost is visible when she trades completing the lullaby for release, though the stakes could sharpen earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amber insect motif—wings "frozen mid-beat" becoming "scattered into sparks"—without explicit moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution, allowing guilt's transformation rather than erasure. The final image of "clear as forgiven sleep" resonates without stating its moral. Strong subtext in the unfinished lullaby becoming complete through release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("meteor hush of a night when time folded in on itself"). POV distance remains stable without head-hopping. Some register elevation in peak moments ("spectral crib mobile") fits the heightened reality but occasionally strains against more grounded passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("drawers sighed open to reveal handwritten letters, their ink still wet though dated centuries ago") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in menu sequences. Filter-verb stack in realization moment ("she saw herself") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds concept offers fresh synthesis, transforming a guilt story through speculative elements. The haunted firmware connecting tattoos to lullabies shows genuine invention. Risk-taking in the lyric mode mostly succeeds, though the amber insect's symbolic convenience prevents higher scoring.</comment>
