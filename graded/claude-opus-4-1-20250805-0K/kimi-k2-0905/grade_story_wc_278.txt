<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tattooist's guilt over the child's death drives consistent, embodied choices through amber-tethering and console interaction, with contradictory impulses (restore vs. erase) acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—choosing release over becoming the lullaby—earns closure through prior causality with visible cost (the static softening to meteor hush). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dissonance of old guilt") rather than fully embodied emotion in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through letters multiplying, the amber dissolving to hologram, and time folding tighter until the final release reweights all prior marking as nodes in haunted firmware. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she walks away with "collarbone quiet at last," showing visible change with felt cost. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (laboratory purpose unclear until paragraph 3) and some causality softness around how the stylus enables the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory setting actively constrains choices through its console interface (three options), drawer-letters that physically tether her, and the amber-to-hologram transformation that shapes tactics. Strong micro-setting work with the console grown from furniture and papers that flutter like moths. The final "sawdust that smelled of nursery pine" charges the ending with sensory specificity. Minor deduction for some abstract spatial choreography mid-story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from seeking silence → discovering the boy's cry → letters revealing her marks as nodes → being tethered by paper chains → facing the trade (voice for silence). The console's menu progression (TRANSLATE/RESTORE/ERASE → UPGRADE/BECOME/RELEASE) tightens options effectively. Cost is visible when she must slice chains to make her choice. Slight deduction for the middle section where pressure briefly plateaus during letter revelations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete progression from marking constellations that become "nodes in haunted firmware" to the final empty amber as "clear as forgiven sleep." The recurring lullaby motif transforms from unfinished → backward → complete, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of lost sounds cultivating guilt until someone trades voice for silence creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for one instance of abstraction ("guilt would quiet") rather than fully embodied realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric compression ("meteor hush," "laboratory of lost sounds") and consistent POV control through close third-person. Strong perceptual signature in how she experiences the lab's pulsing walls and translates the cry as "pure tonal ache." The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the tethering sequence. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("she saw herself") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety and purposeful compression that serves the accumulative design. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some excellent specific phrases ("drawers sighed open," "leash on memory"). Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in paragraphs 10-11 and two instances of abstract phrasing ("dissonance of old guilt," "guilt would quiet") that weaken immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of constellation tattoos, haunted firmware, and lost sounds creates an original premise that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific detail of ink becoming nodes in a sleeper code and the laboratory cultivating guilt rather than storing sounds shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation of traditional lullaby/guilt narrative through technological-mystical fusion avoids templates. Strong risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
