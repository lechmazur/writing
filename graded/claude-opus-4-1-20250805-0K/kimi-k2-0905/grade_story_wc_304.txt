I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist dissolves into the aurora.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve sparks of the dead builds consistently through concrete details like "three hundred and forty-two corpses" whose patterns she harvests. Her final choice to become "a ferryman across the river of forgetting" by dissolving into aurora is earned through prior accumulation, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("threshold of stillness," "radiant hush") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she dissolves into aurora to preserve the sparks, with visible cost ("she did not sink; she dispersed"). The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-building across seven years of visits, though the orientation remains deliberately ethereal and some causal linkages between harvesting patterns and the final transformation feel implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto with its "crystal stalactites that dripped with starlight" and "floating garden of ice orchids" creates a liminal space that enables the transformation. The mirror pool serves as the mechanism for dissolution, and sensory details like "water rose to her ankles, her knees, her heart" ground the fantastical premise in physical progression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving memory against oblivion, with pressure building through the accumulation of "three hundred and forty-two" death patterns. The transformation carries clear cost as she sacrifices herself to become "a lantern" for the dead, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition testing her resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between beauty and death, memory and forgetting, without explicit moralizing. The final image of becoming "the ferryman who becomes the river" resonates as a non-literal answer to how beauty preserves against oblivion, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("threshold of stillness breathed with new lungs").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with inventive constructions like "beautician mortician" and "skyborne grotto," creating a dreamlike register appropriate to the fantastical premise. Some passages accumulate abstract nouns ("threshold of stillness," "radiant hush") that occasionally obscure rather than clarify, and filter constructions sometimes distance us from immediate sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control in passages like "each pattern was a fingerprint of final thought," but suffers from density issues with abstract compounds stacked in nearly every sentence. Template structures appear in the listing of death patterns, and some metaphors stretch coherence ("grotto walls breathing like lungs").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of beautician and mortician into one role working in a fantastical skyborne grotto offers genuine originality. The specific invention of harvesting "static patterns" from corpses to preserve their final sparks, culminating in self-dissolution into aurora, creates a memorable synthesis of death-work and cosmic transformation.</comment>
