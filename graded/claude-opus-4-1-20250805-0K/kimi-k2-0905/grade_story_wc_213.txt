<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between obedience and curiosity drives authentic choices, particularly her decision to switch the bell for the siren. Her embodied reactions to the rope's "twitch" and the pressure drops show concrete interiority. The final choice to leave the toggle in place demonstrates earned character growth through listening rather than controlling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pressure building through atmospheric details toward Mara's decisive unauthorized test. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the bell's six tolls reveal the mountain's voice, with clear cost in breaking protocol. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary and cloud sea create vivid atmosphere that shapes Mara's isolation and choices. Sensory details like "faint electric scent" and the rope "thick as her wrist" ground the mystical elements. The bell and rope constrain her final choice between mechanical and organic warning systems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical curiosity about pitch shifts to the moral weight of breaking century-old protocol. The pressure drops (03:17, 03:42) create urgency toward zero hour. Cost is visible when villages wake "believing the old monks had returned" - Mara trades institutional trust for authentic connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mechanical sirens and organic bells, crystallizing in "favors listening over noise." The six bell tolls carrying the pressure anomaly create a non-literal answer about courtesy toward natural phenomena. The final image of citizens carrying "ghost of six low notes" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's technical attention ("frequency 72 hertz, duration nine seconds") mixed with poetic observation ("clouds surged like slow whales"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical recording to wonder. Some register elevation in metaphors ("warm stones dropped into cold milk") slightly strains POV credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some ornamental metaphors slow momentum ("moon that looked nailed to the sky"). Information density high in technical passages. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story. Strong propulsion in the bell-ringing sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on storm warning systems by centering listening over alerting. The mountain as sentient presence tracking climate through pitch shifts offers originality. Specific technical details (servo arm from spare parts, barometer readings) ground the mystical elements effectively.</comment>
