<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between duty and curiosity drives authentic choices, particularly her decision to switch from siren to bell. Her embodied response to the mountain's "pulse" through the rope and her inherited sensitivity to atmospheric variations create specificity. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("humbled quiet") rather than pure embodiment in the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught atmospheric pressure readings building to the bell's revelation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara chooses "courtesy" over prediction, with visible cost in her unauthorized action. The orientation anchors (windblown sanctuary, solstice, Mara as tester) land within 30 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain sanctuary setting directly constrains choice through altitude, isolation, and atmospheric phenomena. Specific details like "clouds surged like slow whales" and the brass barometer's trembling face create vivid atmosphere. The environment actively participates through pressure drops and wind shifts that trigger the climactic decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through atmospheric anomalies (03:17 and 03:42 pressure drops) that force Mara's unauthorized choice between siren and bell. The cost is legible in risking "civil-defense anger" for authentic response to the mountain's signal. The deepening from mechanical testing to spiritual listening reweights the entire tradition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between mechanical warning systems and organic listening. The six bell tolls creating "sonic maps" of invisible phenomena beautifully merges the scientific and spiritual without stating a moral. The final image of citizens carrying "the ghost of six low notes" resonantly answers whether we should impose or receive meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through specialized vocabulary ("katabatic spill," "lee-wave rotor") and poetic compression ("moon that looked nailed to the sky"). POV control remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature of technical precision meeting reverent attention. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("she understood") in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several filter constructions ("Mara believed," "She understood then") reduce immediacy. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive structures around "she [verb]" in middle sections, though the closing paragraph achieves strong rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of a storm tester choosing ancient bell over modern siren offers a fresh angle on technology versus tradition. Specific details like "inverse chimney the old monks called 'the sky's throat'" create originality. However, the underlying template of choosing authentic response over duty is familiar, limiting higher scores.</comment>
