I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered echoes, refractions, and symbolic accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira accepts the cost of forgiveness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal contradiction between guilt and defiance drives credible choices, particularly the shift from trying to scatter blame to accepting listening as the price. The "innocently mischievous" tone when reciting poetry reveals character-specific coping. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract articulation of the queen's plea lacking more visceral embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "I accept the cost" leading to the spire cracking and feather emergence - visible transformation with clear before/after. The accumulative lens holds as echoes multiply and refract toward acceptance. Slight dock for the mild abstraction in how "forgiveness is a coin" connects to the physical ritual mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon's echo mechanics and bone towers create a setting that actively constrains choice - Lira must work with the spire's resonance properties. The mirror shard functions as micro-setting that enables the refracting action. The split spire charging the final image ("hummed a new note") elevates integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative density - from single echoes to multiplying voices to the canyon feeding back every echo Lira ever flung. The shift from speaking to listening marks the decisive deepening. Cost is visible in the spire cracking and Lira's shadow doubling, though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the refraction metaphor - truth scattered "like white light through a prism" so no single color of blame settles. The ending image of cracks as "bridges, not wounds" offers resonant non-literal answer. Slight deduction for "Forgiveness is a coin" feeling momentarily workshopped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical control ("canyon of endless echoes carried every footstep back...as a whispered accusation"). Clean focalization throughout. Minor issues with occasional register elevation ("sufficient" feels slightly outside Lira's artist lexicon) and some filter-verb clustering in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines with good rhythmic variation. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence runs ("She spoke...She understood...She tucked") and mild paraphrase loop with "forgiveness/forgiven" coin metaphor restated. Some filter verbs dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The refraction concept offers fresh angle on forgiveness - splitting singular blame into spectrum. The bone spire as resonance chamber and the impromptu poetry as method of truth-processing show originality. The shadow doubling (one dark, one echo) is inventive. Mild dock for the coin metaphor feeling slightly familiar.</comment>
