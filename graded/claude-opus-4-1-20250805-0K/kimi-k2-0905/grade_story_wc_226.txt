<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between guilt and defiance manifests through concrete actions (climbing the spire, speaking poetry, accepting the feather). Her transformation from defiance to acceptance feels earned through the canyon's echoing confrontation with her past. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around forgiveness that edges toward therapy-speak ("the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira accepts the cost and transforms her relationship to guilt, with visible change (split spire, feather, doubled shadow). The causal chain from ritual pressure → poetry session → spire response → acceptance holds firmly. Cost is legible in the "doubled shadow" and blood-painting commitment. Minor deduction for slightly rushed middle development where the mirror-shard mechanics could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon and bone towers effectively constrain choices (one hour deadline, specific location for ritual). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (warm spire surface, wind like held breath, mist shapes). The spire functions as micro-setting that shapes the entire resolution. Deduction for some spatial vagueness in the canyon geography and priest approach that could anchor more clearly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting guilt over the queen's death) escalates from external ritual pressure to internal reckoning through the echoing canyon. The cost is visible in accepting the doubled shadow and commitment to paint with her own blood. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira realizes "the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening." Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the ritual threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image system of refraction, echoes, and doubled shadows rather than statement. The feather-behind-ear and promise to paint with blood offer a non-literal answer about shared culpability. Strong subtext in the canyon's echo mechanics literalizing psychological haunting. Minor deduction for one instance of theme-speaking ("Forgiveness is a coin with two faces").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression and selective perception (spire as "needle stitching sky to stone"). POV control maintains Lira's interiority consistently. Some effective rhythm variation under pressure. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against character voice ("the forged hush between sounds grew heavier than any sentence") and some filter-verb clustering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for multiple instances of elevated register drift ("sufficient," "inextricable"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("the truth—refracted, shared, borne"), and minor template cadence in the "She [verb]" pattern through the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgiveness-as-refraction concept with concrete canyon echo mechanics. The doubled shadow and painting-with-blood commitment offer non-obvious resolution. Risk-taking in the lyrical compression and symbol-heavy approach mostly succeeds. Modest deduction for some familiar mystical-ritual framing that doesn't fully transform the template.</comment>
