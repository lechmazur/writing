<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to return the lighthouse fragment creates a compelling internal arc with contradictory impulses (keeping vs. releasing). The choice to hand the fragment to his younger self carries visible cost ("exhaling a life"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("anchors of intuition"), but the final renunciation lands with earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where returning the fragment transforms the narrator from collector to "listener" with visible cost. The temporal loop through the painting creates coherent causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ending line "We keep the light by letting it go" crystallizes the thematic cost effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market setting actively constrains movement ("swaying catwalks") and enables the painting portal mechanism. Sensory details like "copper and salt" air effectively filter through POV. The lighthouse fragment's warmth and the market's transformation to fog enhance the dreamlike atmosphere while maintaining spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal collection to temporal paradox resolution, with the painting serving as the pressure point. The narrator's agency drives the choice to return the fragment, foreclosing his role as translator. Cost is visible in "its absence weighs more than its presence ever did."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of releasing rather than collecting, with "overlooked histories are not collected but released" providing resonant insight. The lighthouse motif reweights from physical object to metaphor for memory and letting go. Final image of children chasing the beam offers non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("between childhood and now"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("elusively tangible" appears multiple times). The perceptual signature of a "between-worlds translator" creates unique focalization, though some abstract phrases reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. However, abstract phrases like "anchors of intuition" and repeated use of "elusively tangible" create opacity. Some template cadence in middle sections ("I pause," "I step," "I walk"). Strong opening and closing lines partially offset these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time-loop painting portal and role of "between-worlds translator" offer fresh angles on memory and loss. The specific synthesis of alchemist market, lighthouse fragment, and temporal return feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept of releasing rather than collecting histories transforms familiar ghost-story elements.</comment>
