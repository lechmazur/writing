I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through dense imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Calla accepts her role as guardian of story-space.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calla's internal journey from seeking to accepting guardian role is earned through consistent traits (eccentric grace, devoted vigilance) and embodied details like the scarf's deterioration mirroring her transformation. The final choice to let go of the scarf while retaining its "invisible filament" shows genuine cost—releasing physical attachment to maintain spiritual connection. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("analog memories waking up") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Calla's transformation from seeker to content guardian, the scarf's dissolution into "invisible filament" marking clear before/after with felt cost. The hyperbolic geometry sequence effectively deepens pressure through spatial distortion. Slight opacity in the middle transformation sequence ("Stories nest where time has no shelf life") momentarily obscures the precise mechanism, though the emotional arc remains clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library's transformation through hyperbolic geometry creates a micro-setting that directly constrains and enables Calla's journey—shelves bending into "saddle curves," the door "painted the exact color of silence." The warped space literally shapes her path and choices. Sensory details like "soft friction of turning pages" and "phosphor like plankton" are selective and purposeful, building atmosphere that charges the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where stories live—escalates through spatial distortion and the scarf's increasing pull toward revelation, with clear cost in the scarf's destruction. The hyperbolic fold sequence effectively tightens pressure as "each step shorter than the last yet covering more distance." However, the middle section relies somewhat on accumulation over active agency, and the resolution arrives through discovery more than earned confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete metaphor of stories as living entities requiring guardianship, with the scarf's transformation into "invisible filament" offering a non-literal answer about preservation through release. The final image of Calla's continued vigil, now understanding stories "endure because someone chooses to guard the space where they breathe," reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral. Subtext operates throughout in the geometry's impossibility and the library's liminal hours.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register ("comet tail of forgotten footnotes," "geometry too exaggerated for Euclid") that maintains consistency through emotional peaks. The perceptual signature—noticing waveforms in pages, hearing "pulses" in books—is character-specific and sustained. Minor register elevation in peak moments ("Stories nest where time has no shelf life") slightly strains the established voice without breaking it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"drifted between the stacks" establishes both movement and ethereal quality. Strong rhythmic control varies sentence length purposefully, accelerating during the transformation sequence. Some figurative density in peak beats ("nautilus logarithms," "mass defect and longing") approaches but doesn't cross into muddle. The prose maintains clarity while supporting the lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a library's hyperbolic hidden dimension where stories literally live is fresh, executed through specific detail rather than generic fantasy. The transformation of a personal quest into acceptance of guardianship offers genuine complexity. The silk scarf's evolution from physical object to metaphysical connection shows originality in handling a familiar trope. Risk-taking in the spatial distortion sequence heightens meaning without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
