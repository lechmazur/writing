<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mercy's journey from gardener to "keeper of the spiral" shows genuine transformation with earned cost (abandoning surface world). Her motivation coheres through concrete discovery beats, though some interiority edges toward expository ("uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs"). The final choice to descend permanently carries visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as repeating discoveries build toward Mercy becoming the next keeper. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she accepts her role, though the cost could be more visceral. Strong causal chain from coin→tapestry→map→cellar, but some transitions feel mechanically convenient ("exactly the diameter of the sovereign").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cemetery-to-silo-to-cellar progression constrains choices effectively, with the tapestry and spiral root system providing crucial spatial logic. "Velveteen gloom" and "cobalt silo" create distinctive atmosphere. The underground refuge with seed packets transforms setting into active story element at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the coin to uncovering family history to accepting an eternal role. The "chess clock set to infinite" crystallizes the cost, though middle beats lack opposition—Mercy proceeds without meaningful resistance. One strong deepening occurs when the cellar reveals her inherited duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The spiral motif elegantly connects coin→tapestry→family plot→inherited role, with "the dead wager memory" providing thematic backbone. Seeds labeled "hope, defiance, return" avoid explicit moralizing while charging the grandmother's legacy. The ending reweights gardening as communication with the dead without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "velveteen gloom" and "tenderly organized heart," though some passages drift into elevated register ("uncharted echoes flutter"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. The prose rhythm appropriately slows during discoveries and accelerates at transitions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases ("starlight drips through the skylight"), but several ornamental constructions slow momentum ("As she works, the silo's metal skin picks up distant church bells"). Some filter-heavy passages ("Mercy understands," "she senses") dull immediacy. The multi-clause final sentence maintains control despite complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of cemetery gardener as decoder of the dead's messages offers fresh angle on familiar Gothic elements. The seed packets as inherited resistance ("hope, defiance, return") transforms expected grave-tending into political legacy. Risk-taking in the hermetic ending pays off thematically.</comment>
