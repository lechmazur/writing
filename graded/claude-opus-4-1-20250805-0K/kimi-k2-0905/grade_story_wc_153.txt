<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal conflict between guilt and the need for forgiveness drives meaningful choices, with the brother relationship as effective crucible. The protagonist's journey from carrying unsent letters to empty pockets shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("fierce tenderness") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to return carries genuine weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with the labyrinth journey building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the apology transforms from unspoken to "seeded." The corridor scene effectively crystallizes the moment of choice with visible cost (the 27 letters becoming moths). Orientation anchors emerge gradually but remain legible; the mystical elements cohere under the story's logic. Slight deduction for the convenience of the medium's exact ability matching the need.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as more than setting—roots that "breathed like lungs" and water that "healed in moonlight" constrain movement and enable the transformation. Sensory details effectively filtered through POV's guilt-state. The gargoyle shard evolves from broken limestone to mirror to breath, charging the final image. Minor weakness in some overly-convenient magical mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciliation with brother) remains clear throughout, with meaningful deepening when the protagonist sees the brother's matching desire for wholeness. The transformation of letters to moths and the healing water provide visible cost. However, the mystical resolution somewhat deflates earned tension—the magic corridor makes the apology easier than the guilt buildup suggests it should be.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring "come back whole" that bridges both brothers' desires, avoiding direct moralizing. The transformation of apology from burden to "lantern made of salt and song" offers resonant answer without stating lesson. The moths carrying syllables and the healed lip effectively embody forgiveness. Strong integration of healing/breaking imagery throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression ("salt and lullaby," "fierce tenderness wrapped in barnacle"). The mystical elements integrate smoothly into the narrator's perception without breaking voice. Strong perceptual signature in how guilt colors observation. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose rhythm with effective variation, though some passages lean toward density ("cryptic medium, her hair dripping tide-pool silver"). Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language accumulation in emotional peaks ("lantern made of salt and song") but pattern feels taught. Template cadence avoided, though occasional synonym proximity ("healed/healing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism with fraternal reconciliation, particularly the "space where an apology waits unspoken" as literal location. The gargoyle shard transformation and letters-to-moths feel earned rather than arbitrary. The specific detail of the brother punching a clock instead of the narrator adds authenticity. Somewhat familiar guilt/forgiveness arc elevated by specific magical mechanics.</comment>
