I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through pattern and repetition toward a resonant transformation where silence literally consumes prophecy.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—folding silence into cranes, swallowing the prophecy sphere—with genuine internal conflict between carrying others' nightmares and preserving peace. The final image of him as "living parentheses around the unsaid" earned through prior sacrifice shows sophisticated character work, though some moments lean toward abstract philosophizing ("terrestrially cosmic, a tuning string between worlds").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative structure builds from individual silence-mapping to cosmic crane multiplication to prophecy consumption, with clear cost: "inside his chest the sphere still rotated...every smoothed hush still murmurs against the bone." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where the summoner accepts eternal burden as the price of others' peace, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The brook setting functions as both literal space and metaphysical workshop where "every ripple into a terrestrially cosmic mirror" enables the magic. Sensory detail supports the hushed atmosphere effectively ("cold gripping his ankles like forgotten manacles"), though some descriptions drift toward abstraction rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal mission to cosmic threat as "prophecy kept growing, threading through dreamers until even babies cried in binary." The summoner's agency drives the resolution through deliberate ritual steps, with visible cost in swallowing the prophecy sphere, though the antagonistic force (the prophecy) could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the paradox that "tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze"—the summoner must consume chaos to create peace. The recurring crane motif accumulates meaning from origami vessels to "galaxy of absences" to final freedom symbol, creating genuine resonance without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyrical control with inventive constructions like "a word shaped like the hole at the center of a flute," though occasionally tips into overwriting ("terrestrially cosmic" appears four times). The perceptual signature of mapping negative space—"the pause inside frog throats, the vacuum inside his own scream"—creates unique texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("telling stones stories they would forget by dawn") but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("terrestrially cosmic" × 4, "smoothed hush" × 3) and occasional opacity. Some metaphors strain clarity ("a period spoken aloud, a gate slamming on sentences"), though the overall momentum sustains through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a summoner who fights prophecy by mapping and swallowing silence offers genuine originality, transforming expected fantasy tropes through specific detail like "babies cried in binary." The synthesis of Eastern (origami) and Western (summoner) magical traditions with information-age anxiety about code creates fresh resonance.</comment>
