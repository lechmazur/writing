<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner's internal logic of collecting silence and folding it into cranes creates a consistent, specific character with clear motivation to stop the prophecy that destroyed his master. His choice to swallow the sphere of silence shows contradictory impulses (protect vs. internalize danger) acting simultaneously with visible cost: "inside his chest the sphere still rotated...every smoothed hush still murmurs against the bone." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around silence-mapping that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the summoner accepts carrying the prophecy internally ("terrestrially cosmic, a living parentheses around the unsaid"). The cost is legible: he must forever bear the weight of what he's swallowed. Causal lens holds throughout with the origami multiplication leading to vacuum creation leading to swallowing. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the summoner's purpose clarifies around line 5) and some opacity around the exact mechanics of "mapping silence."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brook functions as more than setting—it carries the syllables, accepts the paper offering, and its flow guides the summoner's path. Strong sensory work: "cold gripping his ankles like forgotten manacles." The nocturnal atmosphere with moonlight creating "terrestrially cosmic mirror" effectively charges the magical realism. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stopping the prophecy from spreading) escalates from personal ritual to active confrontation when "prophecy fights back" as cricket-encoded drumbeats. The summoner's choice to swallow the sphere shows agency with clear cost. However, the resolution feels slightly too easy—the prophecy's resistance could have been more formidable to heighten the final sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic emergence through the paradox of carrying quiet: "to carry quiet is never silent." The transformation of destructive code into "smoothed, meaningless pebbles" and villages waking to "birdsong free of code" resonates without stating a moral. The recurring crane motif accumulates meaning from prayer-vessels to galaxy to final release. Slight deduction for occasionally abstract treatment of silence/code that could ground more in specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "syllables arranged like constellations had spilled out, burning villages in their tranquil blaze." The perceptual signature focuses on negative space and absence ("the vacuum inside his own scream he never let out"). Some lovely compression and pattern work. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated register that doesn't quite match the folkloric tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments: "He spoke one word—not the code, but its inverse, a sound shaped like the hole at the center of a flute." Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some abstract loops around silence/hush concepts and occasional overwrought metaphors ("terrestrially cosmic" repetition, "tranquil blaze" appearing 4 times).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of defeating prophecy by swallowing silence offers a fresh angle on the chosen-one trope. The specific detail of speaking a period aloud ("'.', a period spoken aloud, a gate slamming on sentences") is genuinely inventive. The synthesis of Eastern (origami) and Western (prophecy) magical traditions feels organic. Slight deduction for relying on familiar fantasy beats despite the fresh execution.</comment>
