<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal conflict between Mara's professional detachment and personal trauma creates authentic tension, with her grip on the lantern as embodied emotion. The revelation about her father adds layered motivation that earns the final choice to speak truth rather than succumb. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("trembled—not with fear, but with recognition") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Mara's investigation layers personal and professional discoveries toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses testimony over silence. The closure lands with visible cost—walking back carrying others' guilt alongside her own trauma. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for slight causality softness in how quickly she connects her father to the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as both physical space and psychological crucible, with maintenance alcoves and carved tally marks constraining investigation paths. Sensory detail ("tunnel stretched before her like a throat") filtered through Mara's investigative lens. The underground railroad lantern creates historical resonance. Minor deduction for some generic weather references ("damp chill") that don't fully exploit the setting's pressure potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional investigation to personal reckoning as Mara discovers her father's potential involvement, forcing her to confront inherited trauma. The cost is visible in her choice to expose the truth despite personal implications. However, the external conflict (dead commissioner's legacy) lacks immediate pressure since the antagonist is already deceased, limiting dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tunnel as confession space and water as memory, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the lantern guiding memories to light resonates without stating its meaning. "The water remembers" gains depth through the tally marks and drought weaponization. Slight deduction for the near-thematic echo in "breaking free from controlling influence" that edges toward prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct investigative voice with controlled distance ("watchfully calm gait") that modulates during personal revelations. Free indirect style clean, though some filter phrases ("she realized," "she understood") could be cut. The perceptual signature of counting and empirical observation defines Mara's processing. Minor repetitive phrasing in emotional beats ("trembled," "gripped") reduces distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, particularly in the tunnel descent sequence. Information density adequate with most lines advancing multiple purposes. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("controlling influence"/"controlling influences," "memories entangled"/"memories entangled faster"), and some scaffold phrases like "she understood" and "she realized" dull immediacy. Template cadence in middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" openings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The preventable death investigator angle offers fresh perspective on suicide investigation, and linking personal trauma to professional duty creates organic complexity. The drought-as-weapon concept and maintenance tunnel tally marks show specific imagination. However, the controlling influence/breaking free arc follows familiar trauma-recovery patterns without sufficient transformation, and the resolution feels somewhat safe.</comment>
