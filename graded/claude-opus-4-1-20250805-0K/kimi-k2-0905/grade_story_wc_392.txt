I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Mara's investigation leads to discoveries that alter her understanding and choices.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("gripped the lantern tighter, its heat grounding her") and clear motivation rooted in personal history. The parallel between Mara's father and the victims creates authentic internal conflict. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("This was why she had taken the case") and the somewhat convenient epiphany about her father being an engineer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear causal progression from investigation to discovery to personal revelation, with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara chooses to expose the truth rather than succumb. The cost is implied through the victims' deaths and her father's complicity. Orientation anchors established early. The closure lands but the cost could be more visceral on the page - we understand it conceptually but don't fully feel Mara's price for breaking free.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Excellent use of the tunnel as both literal setting and metaphorical space ("like a throat," "confession written in concrete"). The lantern constrains choices and provides tactical navigation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("rusted ladder," "iron rungs," "amber reach"). The drought's aftermath shapes the investigation's context effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes established early through the pattern of suicides and escalate through discovery of the journal and personal connection. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes her father's involvement. However, the resolution feels somewhat abstract - "courage to speak the truth aloud" - without showing the concrete risk or opposition she'll face in filing her report.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the investigation's revelations about complicity and control. The water/drought metaphor works on multiple levels. The ending offers a non-literal answer about breaking free through truth-telling rather than death. Some thematic statements edge toward the explicit ("breaking free from controlling influence didn't require death") but are earned through the dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with strong perceptual signature ("watchfully calm gait"). Diction matches the investigator's analytical mindset. Some filter phrases ("she realized," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy. The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation and emotional recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("tunnel stretched before her like a throat"). Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in spots ("She understood... She closed... She picked up"). The metaphor of the lantern from Underground Railroad to guide memories feels slightly strained in the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The preventable death investigator angle offers a fresh frame for exploring complicity and guilt. The specific detail about water rationing during drought as weapon is original. However, the revelation pattern (investigation leads to personal connection) follows familiar beats. The synthesis of professional investigation with personal trauma works but doesn't fully transform the archetype.</comment>
