<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to complete her mother's interrupted cadence drives concrete choices throughout, with embodied grief shown through the pendant's warmth and her walking against impossible flow. The final choice to sacrifice future minutes for memory shows clear internal conflict acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unfinished musical phrase" and "internal ledger" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the interrupted cadence pattern building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira completes her mother's final syllable, paying visible cost (surrendering future minutes). Orientation anchored early (rooftop canals, High Vire), causality holds through magical realism rules. The closure lands with felt cost as she chooses memory over future, though the final studio return slightly dilutes the peak moment's power.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system constrains Mira's path and the pendant's transformation into a Möbius strip charges the climactic exchange. Sensory details like "water reversed direction, ripples climbing backward like silverfish" effectively mirror internal state. The iron aviary with clock-hand bars brilliantly physicalizes time's prison, directly enabling the story's central choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes clearly established (finding where echoes are born to recover mother's last syllable) with meaningful escalation through time-borrowing mechanics that demand repayment. The cost accumulates as borrowed seconds must be repaid with future minutes, forcing the ultimate trade-off. Minor deduction for the giant Bran element feeling somewhat ornamental to the core pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The infinity symbol's transformation from loop to Möbius strip ("one side memory, the other possibility") elegantly embodies the theme of choosing between past and future. The final image of painting "not of what was lost, but of the doorway" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Slight deduction for the explain-y quality of "some debts are paid in full by choosing which memories to set free."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register ("liquid lace," "silverfish fleeing a net") that maintains consistency through emotional peaks. The cadence breathing pattern (4-2-7, then 5-0-5) creates rhythmic control that mirrors the story's musical theme. Clean third-person limited with no head-hopping, though occasional elevated diction ("audible memories") slightly exceeds naturalistic bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("gargoyles yawned, reshuffling their wings into positions they had held last Tuesday"). Some elevated diction borders on purple ("womb of resonance") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor loops in the ending section with "memory"/"memories" appearing redundantly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of borrowed time creating physical debt paid in future minutes offers fresh angle on grief and memory. The iron aviary of trapped echoes and the Möbius strip transformation show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the magical realism and non-linear time mechanics heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
