I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern intensification rather than strict causal linkage, with the moon phases, spiral construction, and reverse migration accumulating toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The navigator's internal contradiction between holding on (stitching herself from departed loved ones) and letting go (becoming the offering) drives authentic tension. Her transformation from navigator to geography is earned through concrete accumulation of loss. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("geography of loss") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the navigator dissolves into the place itself, with visible cost ("body the geography others would someday try to navigate"). The accumulative structure coheres through moon phases and cryptic calls building toward transformation. Deduction for slightly opaque causality in the middle ritual sequence where the connection between actions and effects could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The signal station and its broken hydraulics function as both setting and constraint, with the censer foot's weight fluctuating with moon phases creating tangible pressure. The final white flowers that "opened only in starlight" charge the ending with specific environmental consequence. Setting actively shapes the ritual and transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the three phone calls that progressively demand more sacrifice: maintenance work, then bodily integration (soldering hair), then stepping into the spiral as offering. The cost is legible when she literally dissolves ("stitched seams loosened"). The moon's progression creates temporal pressure that forces action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between technological navigation and bodily offering, with reverse migration as earned wisdom rather than stated moral. The final image of others navigating through her dissolved body resonantly answers the central question of how to return to "places grief had emptied." Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("azimuth," "relay board") with lyrical compression ("moon was a clipped coin"). The perceptual signature maintains consistency through mechanical metaphors for emotion ("tremor of the hydraulics die beneath her skin like a final heartbeat"). No head-hopping, controlled distance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful density, though occasional opacity ("raw solace" appears twice as unclear modifier). Some mild repetition in phrasing patterns ("she had," "she carried," "she stepped") but rhythm varies sufficiently. The prose serves the accumulative design but has moments where metaphor stacks reduce immediate clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of technological apparatus with bodily sacrifice for reverse migration is genuinely fresh. The specific detail of the censer foot's weight fluctuating with moon phases, and the protagonist becoming the geography others navigate, transforms familiar loss narratives. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
