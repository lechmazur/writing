<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from bell-caster who destroyed an organ to one who preserves forgotten names through sound shows clear motivation with embodied emotion ("tears freezing into delicate lenses that cracked when I smiled"). The forgiveness moment anchors the change credibly, though the internal conflict could act more simultaneously in scene rather than through reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator transforms from destroyer to preserver, with visible cost in the tears and the weight of carrying voices. The rope-threading sequence creates clear causality leading to the voices' manifestation, and the final image of names dissolving into rivers completes the transformation with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum functions as more than setting—the aurora's light enables the work, the ice pylons resonate with the rope's vibration, and the glacier both threatens erasure and enables preservation through melt. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted of petrified incense and the coppery ghost of old blood"), with the environment constraining and enabling the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving forgotten names before glacial erasure is signaled early and tested through the rope-braiding action. The transformation from fragile paper to "moving air" shows meaningful deepening, though the conflict lacks a strong opposing force beyond time/nature.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of preservation methods—from bronze bells to braided rope to moving air—without stating morals. The final image of names carried by rivers to "the forgotten sea" offers a resonant answer about memory's fluid nature versus fixed monuments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("lost wax caster turned midnight archivist of breath") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature is strong, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("snowmelt ardor, technically gentle").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting ("technically gentle" appears twice, "snowmelt ardor" feels forced). Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs, though some metaphors strain ("lost wax caster turned midnight archivist of breath").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting technique with memory preservation through sound is fresh and specific. The transformation from destroyer to preserver through a ritualistic act with rope and punched card shows genuine originality, though the lyrical mode occasionally sacrifices clarity for beauty.</comment>
