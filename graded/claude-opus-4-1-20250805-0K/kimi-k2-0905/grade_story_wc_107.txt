I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory detail, metaphorical narration, and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara leaves her creation behind as a "lighthouse for future wanderers."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from grief-frozen isolation to thawing openness is well-embodied through concrete actions (breaking furniture for fuel, crafting the dome) and her dramatic narration device. The final choice to leave the dome behind rather than flee with it shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around grief ("fault lines of sorrow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara abandons her original plan and leaves the dome as a "lighthouse for future wanderers," with clear emotional cost in her transformation from fleeing to planting hope. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building through sensory thaw imagery toward this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally dramatized in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned control room functions as more than backdrop—its thawing ice mirrors Mara's internal state, and specific objects (thermometer, magnetic tape, wooden chair) become materials that constrain and enable her craft. The dripping/melting atmosphere creates temporal pressure and the setting's transformation from "abandoned" to "inaugurated" charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating "safe zones for inquiry" to process grief—deepens through Mara's dramatic narration and physical crafting, culminating in her choice to leave the dome behind. The tension between fleeing and staying provides meaningful escalation. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between physical and emotional thawing, with the glass dome becoming a concrete metaphor for sheltering vulnerability. The ending's "cartographer exits the map" offers resonant non-literal answer to questions of grief and renewal. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction ("emotional tectonic shift").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Mara's glassblower expertise shapes what she notices (materials, heat, structural possibilities). Her dramatic narration device ("Behold, the pilgrim unscrews...") creates distinctive voice that modulates effectively with emotional beats. The rhythm accelerates appropriately toward closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory detail and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("emotional tectonic shift," "fault lines of sorrow") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density reduce momentum. The dramatic narration quotes work well but occasionally the figurative language becomes strained ("heart light enough to lift her footprints off the ground").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dramatic narration device and the parallel between physical/emotional thawing offer fresh angles on grief processing. The specific combination of glassblowing craft with weather station setting creates original texture. However, the core grief-to-acceptance arc follows familiar patterns without truly surprising transformation.</comment>
