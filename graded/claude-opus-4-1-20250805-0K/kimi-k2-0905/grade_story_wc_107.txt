I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from grief-frozen to thawing is well-embodied through concrete actions (building the glass dome, narrating mundane tasks). The dramatized self-narration reveals character-specific coping mechanisms. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "emotional tectonic shift" metaphor that edges toward therapy-speak, though it's quickly grounded in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - Mara leaves the dome as a "lighthouse for future wanderers" with visible cost (abandoning her creation). The pattern of thawing (physical ice/emotional ice) accumulates meaningfully. Minor deduction for the slightly delayed orientation anchors (location clarity comes late in paragraph 1).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned control room effectively constrains choices (need for fuel, materials for glasswork) and the thawing environment mirrors internal state without heavy-handed symbolism. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (metallic scent, cardamom steam). The setting enables the final transformation but could be more spatially precise in the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (creating safe zones for inquiry/processing grief) deepens through the act of creation and culminates in the choice to abandon the dome where it's needed. The internal conflict between fleeing and staying resolves with visible cost. Escalation is more textural than causal, appropriate for the lens, though the pressure could tighten more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel of physical/emotional thawing and the creation of "safe zones" as both literal glass objects and metaphorical spaces for healing. The final image of Mara leaving her creation behind resonates without stating a moral. The recurring dramatized narration device ("The cartographer exits the map") adds thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style. The dramatized self-narration ("Behold, the pilgrim unscrews...") is character-specific and purposeful. Minor repetition in syntactic patterns ("She [verb]" constructions) in middle sections prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in emotional beats ("emotional tectonic shift," "fault lines of sorrow") edges toward overwriting. Template cadence appears in mid-section "She positioned...She narrated...She placed" sequence. The final image is strong and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of dramatized self-narration as coping mechanism is fresh and specific to this character. The synthesis of glassblowing craft, weather station abandonment, and grief processing feels organic. The transformation of technical equipment into art materials shows ingenuity, though the emotional arc follows somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>
