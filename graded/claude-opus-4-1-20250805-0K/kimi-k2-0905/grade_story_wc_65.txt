<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's transformation from mapper to map, surrendering memories for futures, shows genuine internal contradiction acted in scene. Her sacrifice carries visible cost (frostbite, lost memories, dissolution into the page) that earns the closure. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("ignorance wasn't absence but a deliberate clearing") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dissolution that lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the cartographer becomes the constraint enabling future innovation, with visible cost in her complete transformation. The piece teaches its lyric logic early through frost flowers and shadow-tracking. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the spire-lake-cartographer relationship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake function as active constraints—the spire's frequency makes teeth ache, its steps absorb reflections, the lake's perfect surface represents "the last unwritten future." These elements directly shape the cartographer's choices and charge the final hairline crack. Environment and object (kingfisher quill) both constrain action throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake: writing one future before dawn cracks the ice. Escalation through accumulating sacrifice (warmth→memories→name→body) with each loss narrowing options. The constraint-as-gift revelation deepens stakes effectively. Minor deduction as the middle section's predictive modeling visions feel slightly detached from immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the paradox of ignorance as necessary clearing for creation, with the cartographer's sacrifice enabling others' innovation. The final image of the child finding the feather "to sketch inventions that worked backward from their own impossibility" offers resonant non-literal answer. Strong integration of constraint-as-gift throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with strong perceptual signature ("breath crystallizing," "frost flowers blooming from hairline cracks") and controlled lyric register. However, several instances of elevated diction strain POV credibility ("sustaining transformation," "decisive change," "prophet to monument to mere geography") and some filter-verb clustering dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with vivid imagery, but significant issues: run-on final sentence (190+ words), repetitive "hadn't yet been" constructions, abstract scaffolding ("ignorance cartographer," "sustaining transformation"), and some paraphrase loops around the ignorance/knowledge theme. These artifacts don't obscure closure but significantly impact readability.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking-as-erasure with the cartographer becoming the territory itself. The concept of "ignorance cartographer" and futures written through forgetting shows genuine originality. The piece commits fully to its premise of sacrifice-as-creation without retreat into safety.</comment>
