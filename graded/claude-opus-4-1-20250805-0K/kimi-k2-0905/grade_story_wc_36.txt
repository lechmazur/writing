<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's internal journey from certainty-as-fear to accepting stillness demonstrates genuine character evolution with embodied emotions ("lungs felt like catacombs"). The final renunciation of the flute carries visible cost, though some passages lean toward abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Kaelen leaves the flute behind, having learned "driven is only half of keeper." The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-teaching ("avalanchingly quiet") and meaningful deepening through the mirror confrontation. Minor orientation wobble with "after the guardianship" lacks temporal specificity but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range functions as active constraint—its silence must be "drawn up" like water, driftwood markers reorganize themselves, and the canyon "teaches" through its very nature. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaelen's relic-keeper expertise, and the environment directly shapes her final choice to leave the flute.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation reads through accumulative deepening: from arranging markers to breathing silence to confronting her mirror-self, each beat tightens options toward the final renunciation. The cost is legible in leaving behind the object "that had never left her side," though middle development could show more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "harvesting insights from failure" transforms from active pursuit to accepting stillness, with the mirror-self's wisdom ("the failure is still growing") reweighting all prior certainty. The final image of Thunder-echo keeping "its thunder locked behind her teeth" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines mythic register with precise sensory detail ("velvet," "salt-smooth," "bone finger"). The perceptual signature—how Kaelen reads the canyon's signs and interprets silence—remains consistent while modulating effectively under pressure, particularly in the mirror confrontation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Its gold leaf caught no sun; the canyon hush drank light the way dry earth drinks blood"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("avalanchingly quiet") but serves pattern-teaching. Minor compound modifier excess but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of failure-as-teacher with landscape-as-consciousness offers fresh angle on the quest narrative. Risk-taking in the abstract register and non-confrontational resolution (+0.3) elevates beyond typical portal fantasy, with the "unweaving of self" providing non-obvious closure.</comment>
