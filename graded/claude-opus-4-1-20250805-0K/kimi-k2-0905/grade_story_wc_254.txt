<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet demonstrates clear motivation through her linguistic rebellion and transformation of law through poetry, with internal consistency as she moves from banned recusant to boundary-dissolver. Her agency drives every beat through deliberate choices (pressing palm to quartz, speaking into lattice, stepping onto dissolving ice), though some emotional specificity gets lost in the abstract lyrical mode. The transformation from law-breaker to law-rewriter is earned through concrete actions with visible cost (risking re-freezing as "statue of precedent").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake transforms from "moral surface, flat and absolute" to practicing waves, with the poet dissolving into rumor—a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The lens holds consistently as density increases through quartz harmonics, ice calligraphy, and moth patterns building to the final dissolution. Cost is legible in citizens' future uncertainty ("unsure whether they crossed a border or a stanza") and the poet's permanent transformation into rumor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables choices: the quartz colonnade's A-flat hum triggers transformation, ice responds with "hairline fissures," and the frozen lake becomes the canvas for rewriting law. The cobalt atrium and lantern-moths create consistent atmosphere while environmental details directly shape action (boots touching water "that had forgotten how to be solid"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from atrium through colonnade to lake to far shore.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming fixed law into fluid possibility—intensifies through escalating risk as she moves from touching quartz to speaking prohibition to stepping onto dissolving ice, with the explicit threat of becoming "a statue of precedent." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each action deepens transformation: pillars shift pitch, ice becomes membrane/mist/chorus, city reflections waver. The cost lands in both personal dissolution and societal uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of boundaries as parentheses and law as "rough draft of light," with the poet as editor refusing page edges. The final image of the horizon paraphrasing itself into a door she's already stepped through offers resonant non-literal answer to whether boundaries are fixed or fluid. Subtext operates through the quartz music citizens taste "at the backs of their tongues," urging self-paraphrase without explicit instruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice maintains consistent register through inventive compounds ("cloud-shadow," "lantern-moth hush") and musical attention to sound ("None shall pass"/"None shall stay"). POV control is exemplary with no head-hopping, and the prose rhythm accelerates during transformation sequences while breathing during reflection. The perceptual signature—seeing law as revisable text and boundaries as grammar—is unique and sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (description + metaphor + progression), though occasional abstract phrases like "tremor of certainty" recur without deepening. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm matching the transformation's pace. The finale achieves exceptional propulsion: "somewhere ahead, the cloud-shadow poet listened to the horizon paraphrase itself into a door she had already stepped through."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of law as revisable text through poetic transformation is fresh and executed with commitment—every element serves this vision from quartz harmonics to ice calligraphy to the poet dissolving into rumor. The specific inflection of "None shall pass"/"None shall stay" demonstrates how a phoneme shift can restructure reality. Risk-taking in the abstract lyrical mode heightens conceptual stakes while maintaining clarity at closure (+0.3).</comment>
