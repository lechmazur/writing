<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation to "learn the rhythm of repair" is consistently rooted in the eclipse that took his mentor, driving concrete choices through the hall of mirrors sequence. The moment where he uses the flawed eclipse-key to heal itself through the mirror demonstrates embodied contradiction between doubt and hope. However, the final transformation where he becomes "custodian of every eclipse yet to unlock" feels slightly unearned given the limited on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the hall of mirrors serving as the central transformative mechanism. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Rowan steps through the mirror into his mentor's workshop, with visible cost ("the door locked itself with a click that sounded exactly like a heart finding rhythm"). The pattern of reflection-as-repair is taught early and pays off at closure, though the final paragraph's scope expansion slightly weakens the earned quality of the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively constrains choices—frost on the lock pins, mirrors that store "better versions," and the workshop that exists only through the mirror. The recurring detail of "hauntingly bright" light creates atmospheric coherence while the clockwork imagery (gears, escapements, ticks) grounds the fantastical elements. The final image of overlapping ticks promising "a real moon was waiting" effectively charges the closure through environmental detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair" to heal Rowan's irregular heartbeat—accumulates through the mirror sequence where "none sang" initially creates genuine tension. The reversal when Rowan realizes the mirrors store "better versions, drafts the universe discarded" meaningfully tightens options and forces the choice to use his flawed key. The cost is legible when "the door locked itself" behind him, though the final expansion to cosmic scope slightly dilutes the personal stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of repair-through-acceptance emerges organically through the concrete action of healing the broken eclipse-key by "aligning reflection with reality." The final insight that "to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped" arises from specific dramatized experience rather than assertion. The recurring motif of synchronized/unsynchronized time (clocks, heartbeats, lunar cycles) effectively charges the closure without feeling ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive lyrical register with controlled imagery ("coat crackling with rime," "auroras braided overhead") that reflects Rowan's craftsman perspective. The perceptual signature shows in how he notices mechanical details and temporal rhythms. Some elevated diction ("driftwood nostalgia," "escapements") occasionally strains the POV's plausible lexicon, and the final paragraph's shift to omniscient perspective ("somewhere above the frozen library") creates minor distance wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that accelerates during the key discovery sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere simultaneously. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("auroras braided overhead through vaulted glass") and occasional register elevation ("custodian of every eclipse yet to unlock") create minor friction without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central conceit of mirrors storing "better versions, drafts the universe discarded" offers a fresh angle on the repair/redemption theme. The specific synthesis of clockwork mechanics with lunar mythology creates memorable texture. The transformation where healing requires accepting the flaw first ("forgive the gear that slipped") provides genuine insight, though the cosmic scope expansion in the final paragraph trends toward safer territory.</comment>
