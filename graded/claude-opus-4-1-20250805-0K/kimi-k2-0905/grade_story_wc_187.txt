<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's internal conflict between borrowed and authentic identity drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to create the translucent figure as synthesis rather than erasure. The "Fragment is also form" realization earns the final transformation, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("palimpsest," "collective memory") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through fog solidification, crystal whispers, and memory accumulation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses synthesis over erasure. The cost is visible as she leaves her sculpted self behind and walks into uncertainty. Minor orientation drift early ("summer-quill" undefined) but recovers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and lightning statues constrain choices and charge the final image—she must measure shadows to "triangulate the moment memory would ossify." The observatory's architecture (copper dome, obsidian stairs) creates vertical pressure, while solid fog pellets delivering memories shape her crucial realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from abstract archival duty to personal identity crisis when fog pellets strike her temple, releasing borrowed joy that forces the synthesis choice. The "step off the railing" moment crystallizes options with genuine risk, though middle sections drift toward contemplation without active pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mosaic-versus-ledger metaphor transforms the identity question without moralizing, earning resonance through the translucent figure that embodies synthesis. "Fragment is also form" reweights all prior material, and the final image of the city speaking itself anew while she vanishes into its "living manuscript" achieves conceptual depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with atmospheric control ("summer-quill," "stormlit," "chronograph ticked in thunder-time") though register occasionally elevates beyond natural thought ("preemptively nostalgic," "gentle accretion"). No dialogue to evaluate. Some filter-verb clusters in reflection passages slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and rhythm in places ("clouds below had congealed into a rippled plain") but abstract loops appear ("collective memory," "borrowed recollection," "uncertain memory"). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions mid-story. Information density varies—some passages achieve compression while others circle concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of memory becoming physically solid and collectible transforms familiar identity themes through specific world-building. The crystal forecourt that whispers footsteps and the translucent figure left behind offer fresh angles, though the archival framing feels somewhat derivative of literary fiction templates.</comment>
