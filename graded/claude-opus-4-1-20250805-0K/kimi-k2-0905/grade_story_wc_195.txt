<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sir Calen's internal journey from withdrawal to opening is earned through concrete transformations—the puppet revealing his younger self, the moth carrying fortress blueprints, mercury roots rewriting his choices. The final act of planting the seed in his gauntlet cuff manifests genuine change with visible cost (kneeling, frost etching names of deserted men).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design where reality shifts create escalating revelations culminating in Sir Calen's transformation from withdrawn to "opening like a bud." The closure—planting the seed and walking into "imminent light"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost through the acknowledgment of past failures now becoming "compost" for future growth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables choices—the spiral path appearing, temperature plummeting with frost, roots erupting from breathing soil. While rich in atmosphere, some descriptions lean ornamental ("pomegranate trees...silver leaves chiming like tiny bells") without directly pressuring Sir Calen's central transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as each reality shift reveals more about Sir Calen's past failures and future possibilities. The dominant stake—capturing "the shape of possibility"—tightens through the puppet encounter and seed gift, though the cost feels more conceptual than visceral until the final trail of black wood shoots.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central metaphor of "what would you harvest if failure were merely compost?" The marionette theater program transforming into genealogy, then living script, creates layered meaning about predetermined fate versus cultivated possibility without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric precision throughout—"Reality shifted" as structural refrain, selective perception ("thrum of unseen fruit"), and controlled psychic distance. The prose texture suits the mystical premise while avoiding purple excess, though occasional phrases like "factually mystical" feel forced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose control with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting dilute impact: "shivering bliss," "factually mystical," redundant "smiled—an expression rusty from disuse." The repeated "Reality shifted" works as pattern but risks mechanical feel by the fourth instance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of knight's quest, puppet theater, and alchemical greenhouse creates an original mythic space where personal history becomes cultivatable terrain. The risk of lyric abstraction pays off through concrete details (black wood sprouting from footsteps) and the fresh take on heroic transformation through acceptance rather than conquest.</comment>
