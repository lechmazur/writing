<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prince's motivation to reawaken beauty drives credible choices through distilling moonlight, grave-robbing feathers, and assembling the avian heart, with internal conflict between hope and despair embodied in his trembling yet determined actions. His final smile understanding "flawed genesis is still genesis" shows earned acceptance of imperfect creation with visible cost (the palace's destruction). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("raw as the skin beneath his broken crown") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the palace's fall becomes "the first spread of wings," with the prince's acceptance that beauty cannot be caged providing visible cost through the palace's destruction. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the assembly sequence, culminating in the ribbon's transformative release. Causality tracks cleanly from hypothesis through assembly to release, though the late introduction of the Genesis Finch legend slightly weakens early orientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The suspended palace between stalactites creates persistent spatial pressure, with details like "gears in the throne room wept rust" and "chandeliers flickered like frightened stars" both grounding the world and constraining choices. The setting actively participates in closure as the palace's chains snap and it plunges, becoming part of the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtering mechanical decay through the prince's perception of lost beauty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of reawakening beauty escalates through the assembly process, with each component (moonlight spectrum, raven feather, music-box pins) requiring greater sacrifice and risk. The ribbon's escape rather than staying provides meaningful reversal with clear cost—the palace's destruction—though the prince's agency in the final fall could be stronger. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as attempts compound toward the transformative release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete image of "flawed genesis is still genesis," with the ribbon's inability to be caged resonating against the mechanical world's perpetual motion. The final image of a child hearing "colored wind" and remembering the future offers a non-literal answer about beauty's role in transformation. Subtext operates through images like the egg "warm, as though the flawed genesis inside still believed in calendars," avoiding direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("letting the blood pound memory into his skull") and consistent perceptual signature focused on decay versus beauty. The prose modulates effectively with pressure, becoming more fragmented during assembly ("a crack threaded the shell, sounding like the first word"). Minor metaphor density in places but serves the accumulative design and pays off in the transformative ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied rhythm matching scene needs, particularly in the assembly sequence where syntax accelerates. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the egg had been hauled up from the fossil market on a rope of spider silk and debtor promises"). Some figurative density in early sections but coherent and pattern-taught, serving the lyric design rather than obscuring meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical dystopia with mythic resurrection through specific details like "distilling moonlight through a cracked prism" and the music-box necropolis. The concept of beauty as something that cannot be caged, requiring destruction for genesis, offers genuine complexity. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and dense imagery heightens stakes (+0.3), with the transformation of familiar decay-and-renewal themes through the suspended palace's particular world.</comment>
