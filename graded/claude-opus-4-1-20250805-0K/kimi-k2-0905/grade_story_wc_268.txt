<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The titan's motivation is crystalline—restoring cosmic balance through precision rather than revenge—and his regally unpretentious nature manifests through concrete actions like leaving cryptic marginalia. The pretender's character arc from entitled sovereign to exposed stranger lands with psychological specificity. Minor deduction for the titan's emotional flatness; he remains instrumentally focused without internal contradiction or cost weighing his choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the glamour's sundering transforms the pretender into "a stranger wearing ambition for a crown." The accumulative lens holds as cryptic messages build toward the ink pellet's activation, with clear cost in the pretender's complete erasure from history. The piece teaches its mythic register early and maintains coherent causality through the magical system.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library setting actively shapes tactics—the titan must navigate "leaning shelves" and "spiral carrels," while the ink pellet hidden in a codex's gutter drives the entire search. Sensory specificity shines in "iron gall across his fingertips, a dark constellation of accusation." The setting lacks some lived-in texture beyond its mystical properties, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear escalation from searching to baiting to direct confrontation, with the titan's agency driving each phase through marginalia clues. The stakes—cosmic balance thrown off by false sovereignty—manifest concretely when the glamour unravels. The pretender's pride creating his downfall ("pride muffled caution") adds psychological pressure, though the titan faces no personal risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the interplay of drift, anchoring, and truth: "Truth drifts until someone chooses to anchor it; choose again tomorrow." The recurring "regally unpretentious" stance contrasts the pretender's "borrowed gravitas," creating thematic tension through embodied traits. The library's "graceful collapse" and dust motes forming a dissolving coronet reinforce power's ephemeral nature without stating morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct mythic voice with controlled elevation: "centuries when the sky itself holds its breath" and "voice calm as closed winter." The perceptual signature remains consistent—observing cosmic time scales while attending to mite-sized details. POV distance stays appropriately removed for this titan's perspective, though some phrases like "monarchical entitlement" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths creating appropriate pacing. Information density excels in lines like "Stone lions along the balustrade roared in silent approval." Some elevated diction borders on purple ("brocade of borrowed starlight unraveling") but serves the mythic register. Minor template cadence in the middle third's "The titan..." openings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of detective story and mythic fable, with the innovative conceit of a tiny titan leaving marginalia as trap. The iron gall ink pellet as both McGuffin and weapon shows creative integration. The image of truth as something that "drifts until someone chooses to anchor it" offers genuine philosophical resonance beyond genre expectations.</comment>
