I'll evaluate this experimental literary piece under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered sound loops and symbolic accumulation rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest's internal contradiction between faith and doubt manifests concretely through his loop pedal actions, with his final choice to switch off creating genuine cost. The woman's minimal but precise actions (painting the cross, speaking once) reveal character through restraint. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around possession that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where switching off the pedal and leaving it "like a confession that had nothing left to confess" crystallizes the cost of abandoned faith. The accumulative structure coheres through sound layers building to silence. Slight opacity around the possession's nature prevents higher scoring, though the pattern teaches itself early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The loop pedal and ultramarine palette function as micro-settings that constrain choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract atmosphere. The church's physical details (marble nave, cracked fresco, dark oak pew) ground the metaphysical tension perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating sound layers that deepen the dominant stake of faith versus doubt. The reversal when he plays everything in "infinite reverse" meaningfully tightens options. The woman's intervention and the possession's departure create sufficient cost, though the abstract nature of the possession slightly dulls immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wall metaphor ("only blue because we agreed not to touch it") brilliantly reweights the entire faith/doubt tension without stating a moral. Subtext operates beautifully through the loop layers representing collective doubt. The final image of the abandoned pedal resonates as both literal and metaphoric abandonment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends liturgical gravity with technical precision ("dimensional anchor," "acoustically naked"). The experimental approach maintains coherence throughout. Slight register elevation in places ("sagging vowels," "hinges squeak") fits the metaphysical tenor without breaking POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("silence that remained was whole, not hiding"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("stillness unraveling" without fuller sensory grounding).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest concept is genuinely original, transforming religious doubt through sound technology. The synthesis of faith crisis and audio loops creates something memorable. Risk-taking with the experimental structure pays off while maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
