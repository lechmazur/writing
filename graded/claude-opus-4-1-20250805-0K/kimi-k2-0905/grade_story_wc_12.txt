<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest's internal conflict between duty and doubt drives genuine tension through embodied contradiction—his body becoming "a living axle in the mechanism of doubt." The congregation's revealed secrets (widow's lullaby, banker's stolen coins) manifest as concrete micro-choices under pressure. Minor deduction for the priest's final transformation reading slightly abstract despite the physical cost being clear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the priest becomes the dimensional anchor, forever looping to protect the congregation—visible cost in his body "slackened" and consciousness trapped. The accumulative lens holds as layers of silence, loops, and revelations build to transform the sanctuary into a living defense mechanism. Slight dock for the demon's motivation remaining somewhat abstract despite the clever "feeds on certainty" constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's architecture ("vaulted ribs were struts of unraveled stillness") functions as active constraint, with the dimensional anchor's geometry "stressed by the weight of so many simultaneous truths." The ultraviolet color and loop pedal create micro-settings that directly shape the exorcism method. Setting literally becomes character when the priest merges with the space as "a statue ears could see."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each loop revelation weakens congregants' certainty, starving the demon of its required "host who knew what they wanted." The priest's final sacrifice—stepping into his own eternal loop—carries clear cost. The tightening occurs through layered sound manipulation rather than reversals, fitting the accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox "What possesses you if not the need to be possessed?" without stating a moral. The final image of townspeople returning to hear the priest's eternal loop "keeps their certainties politely starved" offers a non-literal answer about faith requiring doubt. The recurring motif of silence as ornament constrains choices throughout and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic description ("a statue ears could see," "null air") and controlled modulation from liturgical formality to surreal compression under possession pressure. The experimental elision of traditional dialogue works because the loops themselves become speech acts. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable despite the collective congregation presence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("decorates with silence the way other temples gild their rafters with gold"). Strong rhythmic control and zero paraphrase loops. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("Möbius strip of intent") that slightly exceeds the established register in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of loop pedal technology with exorcism ritual creates a genuinely fresh angle on possession narratives. The specific innovation—using audio loops to trap a demon in infinite questioning—transforms the exorcism trope through grounded technical detail. Risk-taking in the experimental structure and absence of traditional dialogue heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
