I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where shadows return to their owners.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in scholarly determination, with concrete embodied details like "gloved fingers tracing the brass rim." The choice to trade her shadow for others' wholeness lands with genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("geometry of absence") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lyra's sacrifice restores global shadow-attachment, with visible cost ("traded her wandering silhouette"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through observatory manipulation to shadow reunion. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchored late in paragraph 2) costs some clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory-as-setting brilliantly constrains choice through its "vast orrery of interlocking rings" that must be manipulated to access the shadow realm. Sensory detail like "Stars outside smeared into silver spoons" grounds the fantastical. The floating isle and brass mechanisms directly enable the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lyra's progressive manipulation of the observatory rings, culminating in her sacrifice. The dominant stake (restoring shadows to humanity) is clear, with meaningful tightening when "Her shadow knelt there, waiting, palms open." Cost is legible but could be more viscerally felt in the moment of trade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image of shadows as "love bent into shape by light." The final note about "closing the circle of your own leaving" resonates without moralizing. The piece earns its wisdom through specific imagery rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("time creased like crumpled parchment"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("geometry of absence," "Möbius band of night") slightly exceeds the POV's established range. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of overwriting dilute momentum: "star-threaded dome," "silk scarves pulled by invisible hands," mixed metaphor of "liquid" constellations "pouring." Template cadence appears in lines 19-21 ("She wound...Stars outside...At the spiral's"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork mechanics with shadow metaphysics creates an original world-logic. The spoon-bent reality premise transforms familiar elements. The specific solution (trading one's shadow for universal restoration) feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking with the abstract concepts mostly succeeds.</comment>
