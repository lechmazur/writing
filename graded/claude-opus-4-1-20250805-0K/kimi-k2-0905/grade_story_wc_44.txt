<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to restore shadows is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "gloved fingers tracing the brass rim" and the visceral moment of seeing her own shadow "waving goodbye." The final choice to trade her wandering silhouette shows meaningful sacrifice with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("hearts suddenly heavier") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure with Lyra's sacrifice creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—shadows restored worldwide at personal cost. The piece teaches its pattern early (bent spoons, creased time) and builds through density toward the final image of "love bent into shape by light." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the cost is visible in her traded shadow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's brass rings and orrery floor function as active setting that enables the key action of "closing loops." Sensory details like "stars smeared into silver spoons" effectively mirror internal state. The sundial "casting moonshadows" creates an impossible space that charges the climactic moment. Minor deduction for some abstract world-building that doesn't constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go—escalates through Lyra's active choice to reverse the observatory's rings and engage the automaton. The tightening occurs when she must "walk the circumference of the twist until inside became outside," with clear cost in trading her own shadow. Some middle beats could show more immediate pressure rather than describing the process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image of shadows as "love bent into shape by light" and the concept of "remembering what absence teaches." The new rune Lyra creates—"shaped like an open eye balanced on a spoon"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. The final note about closing "the circle of your own leaving" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "the geometry of absence" and specialized rune-scholar vocabulary. Some register drift into elevated diction ("silent migration of black silk") that doesn't fully match Lyra's established voice. The automaton's "voice wound from clock-springs" shows strong characterization through description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "constellations poured like liquid into the hollow horizon." However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("hearts suddenly heavier with the weight they had unknowingly shed") and some repetitive structure in the ending paragraphs. The metaphor density in peak beats occasionally obscures rather than clarifies action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of shadows detaching at noon after reality bends is genuinely fresh, and the solution through "closing loops" to make "inside became outside" shows conceptual originality. The specific synthesis of clockwork mechanics with mystical rune scholarship creates a unique world-logic. The image of shadows as "love bent into shape by light" transforms a familiar concept memorably.</comment>
