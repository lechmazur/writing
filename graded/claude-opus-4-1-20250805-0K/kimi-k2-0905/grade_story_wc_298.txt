<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between preserving memory and escaping trauma drives genuine choices with embodied cost ("the peas-and-humming memory slip away, a warmth exiting"). Lira's characterization as "reckless idealist" manifests through concrete actions (pressing card to bark, immediate physical collapse) rather than labels, though her sudden hollowing after the trade could use more grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—holes now "sang...with the hum I had lost," reweighting the premise that soul-holes need patching rather than purposeful gaps. The orchard's ledger system ("no one left balanced") establishes persistent constraint, and the final image of "two patched souls clinking softly like purses of mixed coins" crystallizes cost through metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as active setting—skulls "wearing root crowns," apple tree that "shuddered" during the trade—with environment constraining choices (corridor narrowing, roots "tightening like wires"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency well ("damp earth and candle smoke"), though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("dusky resolve" used twice).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal healing to understanding that "patching souls is not sewing shut but weaving new cloth," with the memory trade creating irreversible cost. The reversal when Lira collapses ("patching one soul might pucker another") deepens conflict, though the resolution's ease when she recovers her stride slightly deflates accumulated pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the burned tarot card splitting between sky/water bearer physicalizes incomplete healing. The insight that "some holes must remain for the light to enter" reframes the entire premise without moralizing, earned through the dramatized trade sequence and Lira's collapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("catacomb orchard breathed," "memories leak out like coins through torn cloth"), though occasionally overwrought ("fiercely gentle" appears three times). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, managing lyrical compression without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of repetitive phrasing ("fiercely gentle" x3, "dusky resolve" x2, "half-lit corridors" x2) and some overwriting in metaphor density. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements, though the filter-verb cluster ("I felt...I caught...I carried") in the final third dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a memory-bartering market in a catacomb orchard where trees grow through bones offers genuine freshness, avoiding template fantasy. The specific trade mechanism (symmetry requirement, mother's humming for war memories) and the insight about purposeful gaps transcend standard "healing trauma" narratives.</comment>
