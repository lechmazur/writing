<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lin's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied actions—pressing thumb to leaf, shaping clay hive—that reveal her philosophy through gesture rather than declaration. The fractured timeline perception creates genuine internal complexity as she experiences multiple realities simultaneously. Her final choice to continue wandering with the lantern glass carries visible cost (leaving the restored oasis) earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and recurring images (lantern glass, thrum, kindness) build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lin's departure with the child following creates a "covenant" of transmitted memory. Orientation anchors arrive late (potter identity at line 1, but spatial/temporal context emerges gradually), costing −0.4. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the oasis will "vanish again" but kindness becomes phototropically transmissible—though the multi-timeline device occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned oasis setting constrains every choice: cracked hives guide movement, the single apricot tree becomes focal point, the wasteland necessitates Lin's journey. Sensory specificity excels—"wax ghosts still clinging to slats," "honey turned to ash"—filtered through Lin's potter-consciousness. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting that literally projects paths and overlapping realities, charging the final image of "overlapping suns across the scorched wasteland."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative deepening as the thrum intensifies from "faint" to "splitting one moment into many," forcing Lin's clay-hive response. The dominant stake—whether kindness can persist in devastation—tightens when the bees impossibly return, accepting her "promise." Cost remains somewhat abstract (the oasis will vanish again) rather than immediately visceral, though Lin's departure while the child arrives creates a genuine foreclosure of connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of permanence/impermanence, with the unfired clay hive becoming "a kiln of collective mercy" that paradoxically hardens without fire. The final covenant—"memory travels forward only when carried by kindness"—arises from accumulated images rather than declaration. The phototropic motif (tree leaves "angled like cupped palms," child "phototropic to possibility") creates organic thematic resonance without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lin's potter-consciousness shapes perception distinctively: "clay remembers," "glazes in a slow kiln," seeing time as material to be shaped. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from meditative observation to the fractured intensity of timeline-splitting. Some elevated diction ("phototropic," "covenant") occasionally stretches beyond natural POV lexicon, and repetitive syntactic patterns ("She saw...She saw," "Lin understood...Lin left") create mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagistic precision—"chimney smoke flattened against copper sky," "wings beating in the rhythm of her calm breath"—creates consistent forward momentum. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, abstract philosophical constructions ("the fragile, radiant wall between them") and occasional overwriting ("sealing the covenant") dull immediacy. The "phototropic to kindness" construction, while thematically apt, appears four times creating mild repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Zen pottery-mindfulness with post-apocalyptic bee mysticism creates genuine freshness through specific execution. The concept of time-fractured perception allowing intervention feels earned through Lin's particular consciousness. The unfired clay hive that hardens without flame offers a genuinely surprising image that reframes the story's logic. While apocalyptic wanderer tropes exist, the specific phototropic kindness transmission mechanism transforms familiar elements.</comment>
