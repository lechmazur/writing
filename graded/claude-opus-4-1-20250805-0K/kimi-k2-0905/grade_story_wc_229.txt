I'll evaluate this story systematically under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through sensory layering and repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The assistant lighthouse keeper's motivation is grounded in grief and the need to prove soft frequencies travel farther than mechanical roar. Her internal contradiction between isolation and the desperate need for connection drives embodied choices like adjusting the beacon to pulse in her mother's heartbeat rhythm. The final choice to transmit "screaming tenderness" despite its futility shows earned endurance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the protagonist crystallizes her stance that "the softest voice can travel farthest" while accepting her mother exists on frequencies "too subtle for searchlights." The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (heat breaking, perfume, garden scents) toward this reconfiguration. Cost is felt in "everything she couldn't say aloud but would spend her life transmitting anyway."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, night garden, and vial cork create a micro-setting that constrains and enables the protagonist's ritual. The garden's night-blooming flowers become a "Morse code of longing" that shapes her method of transmission. Sensory layering—from metallic taste of rain to gardenia and tobacco flower—reflects the POV's hypersensitive state and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the three-week wait for cooler air to carry subtler frequencies, building toward the dawn ritual. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes her mother "hadn't drowned but had simply learned to travel on vibrations too subtle"—this reweights the loss without resolving it. The fishing boat's course change provides ambiguous confirmation that soft beckoning works.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox that "the softer we become, the farther we reach," enacted through concrete gestures rather than stated. The vial cork's transformation from childhood memento to floating prism that scatters intention creates resonance without symbolism. The ending reweights all prior soft gestures as acts of "screaming tenderness," offering a non-literal answer about how love persists through loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency through compound imagery ("dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound") and synesthetic perception ("scent rising like a ghost"). The perceptual signature—hypersensitivity to vibrations, frequencies, and molecular communication—stays character-specific throughout. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer accumulative sentences and shorter declarative moments of realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though some conceptual repetition occurs around "vibrations of intent" and "purified intentions." The prose occasionally strains with abstract phrasing like "screaming tenderness of someone who has loved a broken thing too long." However, the lyric coherence mostly holds and the final image lands cleanly without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of proving whispers travel farther than shouts through garden scent and light-pulse frequencies offers a fresh angle on grief. The specific synthesis of lighthouse keeping with molecular communication and the paradox of "screaming tenderness" feels original. The story commits to its soft-power premise without retreating into conventional resolution.</comment>
