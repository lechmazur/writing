<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking redemption through ecological restoration after war. His internal conflict between the "narrow vastness" of grief works effectively. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in emotional embodiment during middle passages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the coachman accepts his role and the garden begins. Cost is visible in the "narrow vastness" widening and the permanent transformation of battlefield to garden. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when/where.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reef-as-battlefield and jetty-as-memorial create compelling micro-setting that constrains choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (coral dust, phosphorescence, morning-glories through bullet holes). The environment directly shapes the ritual and charges the final image of flowers glowing "like low stars."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing the war-torn reef through ritual seeding) is clear. Escalation occurs through accumulation—from scattering seeds to the reef's acceptance to visible growth. Cost is legible in the coachman's permanent wandering state. Minor deduction as the pressure doesn't significantly tighten options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of gardens metabolizing gunpowder. The "narrow vastness" concept effectively captures grief's paradox. Final image of the jetty's flowers as "proof that even after the reef dies something can still choose to grow" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("moon-moth wings," "submerged concord"). Perceptual signature clear in how the coachman reads bird calls and translates languages. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established voice ("metabolize gunpowder").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive "narrow vastness" phrase (4 uses) and slight overwriting in figurative density during middle passages ("helical seeds that spun like propellers").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-war healing through ecological restoration with specific details (dead languages, bird-call translation). The concept of a coachman as ecological healer feels earned. Transforms familiar war-aftermath material through the specific lens of reef restoration.</comment>
