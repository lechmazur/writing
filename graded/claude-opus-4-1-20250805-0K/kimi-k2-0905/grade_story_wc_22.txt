I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and ritual transformation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's ritualistic mission drives consistent action through speaking dead languages to heal the battlefield. His transformation from death-carrier to seed-bearer lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("narrow vastness tighten into a corridor of time") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the battlefield transforms into a flowering grove, with clear cost in the coachman's bleeding tongue and the permanent change to his purpose. The accumulative structure builds through ritual stages to earned closure. Slight opacity in the treaty's mechanics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty that "budded with land-flowers that tasted salt" and the battlefield beneath bleeding iron create vivid, constraining environment. The setting actively shapes choices—the coachman must kneel where "planks ended in a lattice of roots." The final grove "swaying like underwater kelp beneath the stars" charges the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to ecological healing as seeds transform weapons into white flowers "shaped like outstretched hands." The coachman's physical cost (bleeding tongue) and permanent transformation provide clear price. The treaty fulfillment carries weight though the battlefield's initial threat could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the transformation of violence into growth without stating morals. The final whisper "begin" and coral polyps "remembering the shape of peace" offer resonant answers about renewal. The garden's "slow, patient conquest of every wound" synthesizes healing and persistence perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends lyrical precision ("wheels grinding coral dust that had once been alive") with mythic register. The perceptual signature remains consistent—focusing on transformation and death-to-life transitions. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("narrow vastness") but maintain overall coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though "narrow vastness" appears four times creating mild repetition. Some abstract constructions ("ceremony of forgetting remembered") and occasional overwriting ("touched wings") create minor drag. The final passages achieve strong momentum with cleaner, more direct language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of ecological restoration with mythic ritual. The specific detail of speaking in "the tongue of the trilobite, the ammonite, the reef-builder" and seeds becoming vines that wrap bayonets shows fresh imagination. The coachman as death-language speaker who heals through ancient words feels genuinely inventive.</comment>
