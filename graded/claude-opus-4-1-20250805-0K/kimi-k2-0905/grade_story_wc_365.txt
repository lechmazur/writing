I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through sensory layers and parallel universe strands, with the green glass shard's cyclical pulsing creating a pattern that culminates in revelation and reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The map maker's contradictory impulses act throughout - charting what no longer moves while discovering she was complicit in destruction. Her final choice to "chart consequences" instead of places lands with visible cost (the weight of buried truths in her copper-wire veins). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle sections ("weight of withheld truth") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist discovers her complicity and chooses to redirect all future work toward revelation, with cost visible in "copper wire of her veins" and the bay's final exhalation. The accumulative structure through parallel universes coheres well. Slight opacity around the data cube's function prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as multi-dimensional setting that constrains choices - the green shard only activates here, the parallel versions reveal different truths, zero-g forces specific movement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust tasting of rust and forgotten fuel"). The bay's final settling "into the shape of a question" charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from mapping sensory data to discovering lover's fate to uncovering her own complicity. The revelation that she funded the cover-up through her maps creates meaningful cost. Pressure builds through the parallel universe sequence, though the middle section's pacing slightly diffuses tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that "Truth is the mass of what you still carry after the universe forgets you." The story explores complicity and revelation without moralizing, letting the final image of the bay as "a question she is finally ready to answer" resonate. The recurring motif of mapping/charting gains new meaning when redirected from places to consequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through sensory-focused narration fits the map maker's profession. Some elevated diction ("cyclically spontaneous," "weaponized beams") occasionally strains against the intimate POV. Strong control in the parallel universe sequences maintains clarity despite complexity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("her lungs full of dust tasting of rust"). Template cadence appears in parallel universe section ("In one bay...in another") -0.4. Some abstract phrasing ("weight of withheld truth," "measure gravity of silence") reduces immediacy -0.3. Information density is high and the closing image lands effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parallel universe mechanism offers a fresh angle on self-discovery, with each version revealing different aspects of truth. The concept of a sensory map maker who discovers she mapped targets for weapons shows originality. The synthesis of personal loss and systemic complicity feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
