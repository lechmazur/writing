I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory layers and parallel universe fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist discovers her complicity and chooses to redirect her future work.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The map maker's internal contradiction between her sensory gifts and unknowing weaponization creates genuine tension. Her discovery of complicity lands with embodied cost ("the map maker's own maps, sold to distant militaries, funded the cover-up"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("the precise ache of longing").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through parallel universe exploration to the revelation of complicity and decision to "redirect every future commission toward revelation." The cost is visible in her realization that she was "the instrument, her sensory gifts weaponized." Minor orientation delay in the parallel universe mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as both setting and metaphor, with its "broken ribs" mirroring the protagonist's fractured understanding. The green glass shard constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory details effectively filter through the map maker's specialized perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal exploration to discovering her lover's fate and her own complicity. The pressure accumulates through parallel universe revelations, though the middle section could tighten. Cost is legible in her decision to redirect all future work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weight of withheld truth and complicity without explicit moralizing. The note "Truth is the mass of what you still carry after the universe forgets you" resonates without feeling forced. The ending reweights her sensory gifts from neutral tools to instruments requiring ethical direction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with sensory-focused perception ("lungs full of dust tasting of rust and forgotten fuel"). Some register elevation in places ("cyclically spontaneous") that slightly strains the POV. Strong control of psychic distance through parallel universe shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("the bay's ruined geometry fold inward, bulkheads bending without motion"). The phrase "cyclically spontaneous" appears three times, creating mild repetition. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The parallel universe exploration of alternate selves offers a fresh angle on self-discovery. The concept of sensory mapping as both gift and weapon provides originality, though the abandoned spaceport setting feels somewhat familiar. The specific synthesis of elements creates a coherent vision.</comment>
