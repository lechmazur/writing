<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's internal contradiction between skepticism and hope drives genuine choices throughout, particularly in his interaction with the cello and seashell. The final choice to leave the cello "deliberately unvarnished" represents earned wisdom about truth's porosity, with visible cost in abandoning his certainty. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("gloomy cheerfulness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Arlen's transformation from debunker to acceptance of mystery lands with felt cost in his abandoned certainty. The three universal sounds motif builds coherently toward the revelation about listeners insisting on difference. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (observatory location clear, but Arlen's immediate purpose takes time to crystallize).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively shapes the story—broken telescope swinging north, plaster constellations crumbling, the cello on the central platform all constrain and enable Arlen's journey. The painted seashell's specific details (spiral roses, turquoise waves) matter to its transformation. Deduction for some vague spatial transitions and the abstract "whisper of closing pages" timeframe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving why civilizations bury three sounds with their dead—deepens through Arlen's cello playing as each note resurrects voices and forces him to confront his past certainty. The cost accumulates visibly as the seashell cracks and Arlen abandons his debunker identity. The escalation through three notes to final understanding works, though the middle section could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the tension between measurement and mystery, with the final insight that "the riddle was not why the sounds were identical, but why listeners insisted on difference" reweighting the entire quest. The unvarnished cello as metaphor for porous truth resonates without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "gloomy cheerfulness" which feels slightly imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the mythic scope—phrases like "boots crunching on glass that once measured starlight" show strong perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the resurrection sequences. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match Arlen's pragmatic debunker origins.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable lines like "truth ought to remain porous" and effective rhythm variation. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("gloomy cheerfulness," "ephemeral compass") and some repetitive constructions in the middle section ("He retold," "Arlen retold") create minor momentum drag. The closing paragraph achieves excellent propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a myth debunker using a painted seashell and unfinished cello to decode universal burial sounds is genuinely fresh. The transformation of skeptic to believer through resurrected voices offers a non-obvious angle on the search for truth. The specific synthesis of scientific inquiry with mystical acceptance feels earned and memorable.</comment>
