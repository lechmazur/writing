I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** based on its lyrical progression and pattern-based structure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a skeptic-turned-believer drives meaningful choices, particularly her acceptance of the emergent compass's transformation. The weather-carriers show distinct traits through embodied details (frost patterns, invisible wind). Internal conflict between skepticism and wonder acts simultaneously throughout, though some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation from tracking to understanding weather-carriers, with visible cost in her "remaining years" dedication. The accumulative structure builds through layered encounters toward this shift. However, the final paragraph cuts off mid-sentence ("The lavender"), and some causality around the "election" concept remains opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lavender bluff setting constrains the convergence point and charges the final image effectively. Sensory details layer purposefully (ozone taste, static electricity, aurora colors). The tin compass ring functions as micro-setting that evolves from ornament to active compass, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the weather-carriers' arrival sequence, each adding pressure that forces Mira's understanding. The forest election provides meaningful deepening that reweights her role. Cost appears in her life dedication, though the immediate scene cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of carrying collective emotional weather, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Mira as guide rather than carrier offers resonant non-literal answer. "Futuristic nostalgia" integrates well as simultaneous homesickness and hope, though occasional abstractions ("terrestrially cosmic web") approach philosophy rather than scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm supporting the accumulative structure. Perceptual signature strong through taste-based sensing and synesthetic descriptions. Some passages drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV's grounding ("emergent compass guiding others toward the same understanding").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("aurora paint memories across the sky"). Information density generally high with multi-functional sentences. However, several paraphrase loops appear (weather-carrier descriptions repeat similar concepts), and abstract phrases like "terrestrially cosmic existence" lack concrete grounding. The cut-off ending damages clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of weather-carriers as elected holders of collective emotion offers fresh synthesis. Specific details like the tin compass ring's generational awakening avoid generic mysticism. The forests holding elections through root networks shows imaginative world-building, though execution occasionally relies on abstract conceptual language.</comment>
