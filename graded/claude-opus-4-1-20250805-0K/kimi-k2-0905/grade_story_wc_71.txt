<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireille's motivation is clear and consistent—she notices when normality tilts—and her ritualistic interaction with the house shows concrete embodied choices under pressure. The internal logic of her gift and her response to the sentient architecture is compelling, though the emotional stakes could deepen further. Her final wondering about "when the whole city exhaled warm" suggests character growth through earned understanding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through displaced objects, breathing houses, and violet perfume building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mireille establishes a covenant with the sentient house. The closure lands with visible cost—the orris shard embedded as payment—and the final image of streetlights surrendering dreams while she wonders about a city asking to be held reweights the opening's daydreaming streetlights beautifully. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay setting with daydreaming streetlights and sentient architecture creates a lived-in magical realism where environment directly constrains choices—the house's breathing patterns, the objects' displacement codes, the orris root's violet dust all shape Mireille's ritual response. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gate to yard to parlor, and sensory details (ironed linen, vanished birthdays, cedar chest smell) are filtered through her particular gift. The micro-setting of the orris root functions as both tool and covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the grammar of sentient architecture before it spreads—escalates from observation to ritual interaction to covenant-making. Mireille's agency drives the resolution through her deliberate displacement ritual (removing shoe, turning frame, folding paper boat), with visible cost in the embedded orris shard. The tension between the house's loneliness and potential spread creates authentic pressure, though a sharper moment of risk or trade-off could strengthen the middle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "creeping normality"—things becoming alive at the edges of perception—without ever stating a moral. The recurring motif of borrowed life ("choreograph a heartbeat it could borrow," "borrow life without stealing it") deepens through action, and the final question about a city asking to be held offers a resonant non-literal answer about loneliness and connection. The orris root's transformation from silencing shard to embedded covenant enriches meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("pearl dawn," "hushed blaze trails") and consistent perceptual signature—Mireille notices tilts, displaced inches, frequencies. The extended metaphors (house as breathing entity, streetlights as dreamers) remain coherent throughout. Slight register elevation in places ("inadvertently profound sentence") fits the magical realist tone without breaking POV plausibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs—"The ground answered with a low vibration, the same frequency streetlights hum when they daydream" advances plot while reinforcing the animacy theme. Some minor loops appear ("shard of hush" repeated, "creeping normality" echoed) but function as purposeful pattern-teaching. The final incomplete sentence "The orris had taught her that silence could" reads as intentional ellipsis rather than error.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of a "creeping normality noticer" who diagnoses sentient architecture through displaced objects and perfume rituals offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of elements—violet orris root as silencing agent, houses lonely for choreography, streetlights that daydream—creates an inevitable-feeling world logic. Risk-taking in the incomplete final sentence and the covenant-making ritual heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
