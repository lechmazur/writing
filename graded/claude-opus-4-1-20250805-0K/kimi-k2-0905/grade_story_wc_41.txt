<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetting creates genuine internal contradiction—knowing what he'll lose before losing it—embodied through physical chalk marking and spatial navigation. The final choice to mark the fog statue despite knowing it will fade demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("cruel inversion") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with density increasing toward the tape discovery and final chalk marking as Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is legible in "one forgotten tomorrow at a time" and the conscious choice to mark what will fade. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3; causality within the lens remains consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculptures and driftwood markers constrain navigation choices and enable the tape's discovery, while the gravel of crushed VHS cases creates textural specificity. The chalk's dusty residue and magnetic tape decay scent ground the sensory world. The spiral of driftwood directly shapes the climactic discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around capturing "the sound of growing older" with escalation through the driftwood arrangement leading to tape discovery. The cost manifests in accepting perpetual forgetting—"tomorrow he would locate this spot again through fresh intuition." One meaningful deepening occurs when the tape reveals the sought frequency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of marking impermanence, with the final insight that "clinging to echoes was perhaps the most honest form of letting go." The tape's frequency shift between beginning and end embodies aging itself. The circular structure reinforces the theme without stating it directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through focus on decay, sweetness of oxide, and "fog sculptures...like breath made visible." Voice maintains consistency through lyric accumulation. Some register elevation ("temporal monuments to impermanence") occasionally strains but mostly serves the prophet's otherworldly perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong propulsion with vivid specificity like "boots crunching on crushed VHS cases." Some figurative density in places ("monuments to impermanence," "tidal longing," "magnetic increments") without full pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in "He began...He sat...He marked" sequence but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The precognitive forgetting inverts typical memory narrative—knowing future loss rather than past. The junkyard prophet as fog garden wanderer reading driftwood patterns offers fresh synthesis. The concept of marking what will fade as "the most honest form of letting go" transforms the futility trope.</comment>
