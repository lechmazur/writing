<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetting creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices throughout, particularly in his chalk-marking system and tomorrow's amnesia. The final realization that "clinging to echoes was perhaps the most honest form of letting go" earns its weight through accumulated embodied details of decay and memory loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks, with the cassette tape discovery providing meaningful deepening that reweights the prophet's search. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the spiral marking act, though cost could be more viscerally felt beyond the philosophical "one forgotten tomorrow at a time."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden functions as active setting that constrains navigation and mirrors impermanence throughout. Sensory detail effectively layers decay (VHS sweetness, magnetic tape scent, metallic fog taste) with the prophet's perceptual priorities, though some descriptions edge toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding "the sound of growing older" coheres through accumulating discoveries, with the cassette tape providing the key deepening moment. Agency manifests through the prophet's deliberate marker system and choice to sit within the spiral, though the final cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of decay imagery, temporary monuments, and memory artifacts without explicit moralizing. The final insight about marking mattering more than marks offers a non-literal answer to the central question, effectively reweighting all prior ephemeral gestures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature maintains the prophet's selective attention to decay and impermanence, with controlled psychic distance throughout. Some passages drift into elevated register ("tidal punishment," "monuments to impermanence") that strain against the junkyard prophet's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density remains high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("fog sculptures shifted...momentary monuments to impermanence" follows similar content). Template cadence appears in the repetitive "He [verb]" constructions mid-story, and some metaphors edge toward purple prose ("bones pointing toward revelation").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The precognitive forgetting concept offers a fresh angle on memory and impermanence, with the inverted tomorrow-amnesia creating genuine originality. The synthesis of junkyard archaeology with temporal confusion feels earned, though some imagery (fog as praying hands) tends toward familiar territory.</comment>
