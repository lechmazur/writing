<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve memory against the prophet's erasure is clear and consistent, driving her radio-ghost preservation work. Her internal contradiction between loneliness and chosen isolation manifests concretely through her actions. The final choice to teach "light to hold space for its own shadows" carries visible cost as she remains alone but transforms her isolation into purposeful solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through radio frequencies and shadow preservation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara's song creates "variant allegiances blooming" and the prophet hears his forgotten humanity—a clear before/after with the cost of her continued isolation. The early prophecy setup pays off through her role as memory-keeper rather than destroyer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico constrains choices by capturing and preserving shadows/memories, becoming the physical medium for Elara's resistance. Lightning crystallizing in the glass creates a "frozen tree" that branches through possibilities, directly enabling her broadcast. The observatory's storm-wrapped isolation shapes both her working conditions and her emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal excommunication to civilizational memory-loss as the prophet rises. The electromagnetic scream of dying knowledge creates urgency, forcing Elara to act. Her song spreading through frequencies and causing the prophet's followers to remember doubts represents meaningful deepening with visible cost—she remains alone while others reconnect.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shadow/light dialectic without explicit moralizing—shadows as "parts of ourselves we learned to fear." The prophet's private confession reveals he's equally imprisoned, adding complexity. The final image of Elara "alone in the way of someone who has" (incomplete but resonant) reweights solitude from curse to chosen stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphoric density ("ink in water," "rusted bells"). POV distance stays stable in close third. The incomplete final sentence feels intentional rather than accidental, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("storm's electric heart").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose carries strong imagery but suffers from repetitive "through fragmented radio frequencies" (3x identical) and occasional overwriting ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The incomplete ending undermines closure clarity despite apparent intentionality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The radio-ghost concept freshly combines technological haunting with memory preservation. The prophet as unwilling vessel ("the thing that wears my face") transforms the antagonist trope. Elara's role as archivist rather than warrior-hero offers a non-obvious response to tyranny.</comment>
