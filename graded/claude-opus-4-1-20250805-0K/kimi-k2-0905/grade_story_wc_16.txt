<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is rooted in familial loss and builds compellingly toward her final choice to become part of the symphony. The "carefully reckless" trait manifests through concrete actions like practicing in anechoic chambers. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around internal states ("tasting ash") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Elara's transformation into part of the symphony carries visible cost (shattering of the ink well, voice transformation). The pattern of silence/sound builds density toward the resonant reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the abrupt cutoff mid-sentence at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting actively constrains choices through its fluorescent hum matching grandmother's frequency. Strong use of sensory detail (audible light, walls singing). The glass ink well's shattering creates prisms that scatter sound—environment shapes the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear escalation through three promises building toward the symphony's completion, with each promise carrying increased risk. The final choice to "become the last note" shows agency with visible cost. Stakes tighten from personal restoration to accepting permanent transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete metaphor of language as symphony that can heal or weaponize. The ending reweights silence/speech without moralizing—Elara chooses to speak despite cost. Strong resonance in "some things must break to release what they hold."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and strong perceptual signature (sound as physical presence). Some elevated diction ("cautious exuberance," "symphonies of truth") fits the arcane linguist POV. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in peak beats ("audible light," "captive sounds"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for the incomplete final sentence and occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of language-as-weapon/healing through the symphony metaphor, with specific execution through harmonic frequencies rewriting neural pathways. The "carefully reckless" paradox plays out meaningfully. Risk-taking in the incomplete ending adds tension (+0.2 within band).</comment>
