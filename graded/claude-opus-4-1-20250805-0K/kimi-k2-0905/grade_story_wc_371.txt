<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mila's characterization as a "creeping normality noticer" manifests through concrete actions—planting bread pieces, returning to check growth—with internal conflict between preserving memory and fearing amnesia's spread. The transformation from observer to active gardener carries visible cost (soil under nails, tears salting crust), though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("heuristically gentle" repeated without embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through bread-planting ritual to herbs spelling shop names to reopened bakery. Closure achieves resonant reconfiguration when Mila becomes the gardener with soil under her nails, though cost remains more conceptual than visceral—the "private liturgy against forgetting" lacks a specific price beyond general vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices effectively—the vanished bakery produces the impossible bread, the secret courtyard enables the guerrilla gardening method, and cracked marble/mosaic gods charge the final image. The city's amnesia ("shops disappearing," "alleys narrowing") creates pressure that drives action, though some descriptions remain abstract ("creeping normality").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on memory versus erasure with escalation from noticing disappearances to finding bread to planting it to witnessing revival. The gardener's warning about "tenuous absolution" creates constraint, though the actual cost of failure (what happens if memory fully erases) remains abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—bread as "daily resurrection," herbs wearing "breadcrust armor," the sacred revealed as "continuous." The ending reweights earlier material when Mila pockets crust "not relic but reminder," transforming the miraculous bread into ordinary possibility without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("heuristically gentle," "tea-steam sighs") and distinct perceptual signature (Mila notices architectural decay, flour ghosts, vine partings). Some register elevation feels unmotivated in peak moments ("absolution stays tenuous only if left unleavened"), and dialogue remains minimal, limiting character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of sharp specificity ("flour ghosts," "breadcrust armor") but suffers from abstract loops ("creeping normality" appears 4 times without variation) and elevated diction that occasionally obscures ("heuristically gentle" never gains concrete meaning). Information density varies—some paragraphs advance multiple layers while others circle concepts without progression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of bread from vanished bakeries becoming seeds for memory-gardens offers genuine freshness, synthesizing magical realism with urban decay. The transformation of Mila from observer to gardener feels earned, though some elements (the tea house appearance, the gardener's role) feel conveniently timed rather than inevitable.</comment>
