I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category, inferring a **Hybrid drive lens** (primarily Accumulative/Textural with Causal elements at closure).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by ancestral debt. The boy's transformation from fear to understanding shows genuine internal conflict, particularly in "mournful elation flooded his eyes." However, the boy lacks distinctive characterization beyond his role as debt-bearer, and some emotional transitions feel rushed in the compressed timeframe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong closure with Decisive Change - the debt's resolution transforms both characters, with the ghost gaining physical form and the boy receiving the seed. The accumulative visitations (seven nights) build pressure effectively. Cost is visible in the greenhouse's dissolution and the "splinter of iron" pulled from the boy's blood. Minor deduction for slightly unclear temporal mechanics in the middle section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is vividly realized with "pomegranate trees that bore fruit of molten silver" and "branches grafted with humming quartz." Setting constrains choice through the aluminum thread protection and enables resolution through the golden fruit. The transformation of space at closure ("dissolved into falling petals of moonlight") charges the final image powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the seven visitations, with each leaving tangible effects (frost on lashes, bead in heart, accelerating fruit ripening). The boy's agency emerges in offering his wrist and ultimately choosing to grasp the fruit. Cost is legible in the greenhouse's sacrifice and the generational guilt's extraction, though the boy's acceptance feels slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the debt-as-vine metaphor and the transformation of obligation into gift. The final image of planting "a tree that would need no steam, no endless night" resonates without moralizing. "Debts can become gifts if carried far enough" lands naturally from the dramatized events rather than as thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("veil trailing like smoke," "iron air"). The ghost's dialogue ("Debt is a vine; it finds any sun") carries appropriate otherworldliness. Some passages lean toward purple prose ("atoms of ash becoming moths"), and the boy's voice lacks distinction, but overall maintains atmospheric consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, with most lines carrying multiple functions. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("lovingly venomous" appears twice as modifier) and some register drift in peak moments ("mournful elation flooded his eyes" feels slightly removed from the established voice).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse as debt-crucible offers fresh conceptual territory. The transformation of haunting into healing through the fruit-as-currency mechanism shows genuine ingenuity. The specific detail of "aluminum thread that hurt her to approach" demonstrates particular thinking, though some gothic elements feel familiar.</comment>
