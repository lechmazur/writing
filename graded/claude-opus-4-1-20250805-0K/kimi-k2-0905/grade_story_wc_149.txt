<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—teaching the boy to die before the tumor blooms—with her debt driving escalating choices from ephemeral appearances to physical intervention. The boy's transformation from passive greenhouse laborer to active participant in his own salvation shows earned change through dramatized beats. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "debt" in early passages before it gains specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the boy's survival and the ghost's dissolution create visible transformation with clear cost—she dissolves to save him. The accumulative/textural lens holds as ephemeral appearances build toward physical manifestation and final sacrifice. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, ghost, boy) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the unfinished final line "Sometimes, when" which slightly weakens the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse with its "leaden apple trees" and "poisoned fruit" constrains choices throughout—the boy cannot escape, the masters control the space, and the environment itself cultivates death. The frozen river becomes the setting's counterpoint where transformation occurs. Setting directly enables the resolution as the ice/water provides the mechanism for the tumor's drowning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the ghost's search to the boy's discovered tumor to the masters' harvest attempt, with clear tightening when scalpels appear at the grafting altar. The ghost's intervention and the boy's choice to step onto black ice show agency foreclosing the path of passive victimhood with visible cost. Minor deduction as the tumor threat could have been more viscerally felt in middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "lovingly venomous" mercy—killing as saving, drowning as rebirth. The carved bead's spiral brand connects past and present suffering, while the ghost's teaching transforms murder into salvation. The spring aftermath where "the alchemical orchard did not bloom" provides resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains gothic-lyrical register with phrases like "moon-dust that never quite touched the soil" and "resonant awakenings." POV control stays clean in omniscient mode with selective access to both ghost and boy's experience. The prose rhythm accelerates during the escape sequence appropriately. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the story's established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery and selective detail create atmosphere, but several instances of elevated diction ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous") appear without full pattern-teaching. The unfinished final line creates an artifact. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some repetition of "winter-cracked fields" and similar phrases without evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ghost bride seeking to save her husband's descendant by teaching him to die offers a fresh angle on haunting stories. The alchemical greenhouse as a site for cultivating tumors in children transforms the garden archetype. The specific synthesis of mercy-as-murder with generational debt creates memorable complexity, though some elements feel slightly derivative of gothic tradition.</comment>
