<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deepens from professional curiosity to moral imperative, with concrete embodied details like the tingling stamp mark and working by touch. The final choice to rewrite history carries visible cost (defying the Council), though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous rather than sequential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with pattern-based discovery building to a Decisive Change where Mara chooses to document suppressed history. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the cost of defying the Council's false history is legible. The closure lands with "each step echoing like a newly catalogued truth," though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded library setting directly constrains Mara's investigation (darkness forcing tactile reading, water rising to her knees) and enables discovery through phosphorescent plankton. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from atrium to catalogue to stairwell, with environment shaping both method and meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional task to uncovering civilizational deception, with the blackout creating urgency and water rising as physical pressure. The tightening occurs when Mara discovers the catalogue's "honest origin was erasure itself," forcing her choice between compliance and truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stamp's negative space metaphor—truth found in absence rather than presence—culminating in "knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech." The concept of institutional erasure develops through concrete discovery rather than assertion, though the final line edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction ("reclaimed stillness settled," "dappled resolve") that maintains consistency. Perceptual signature shows in details like "neural static" and "the hush of civilizations," though some phrases like "tranquilly perceptive" feel slightly forced from the prompt requirements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts, but occasional overwriting ("immaculate conception of knowledge") and some template phrasing ("Hours dripped past"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though metaphor density in places approaches excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of reading absence as presence offers fresh perspective on archival work, with the underwater library providing non-obvious setting. The revelation about erasure as control mechanism transforms a procedural task into political resistance, though the civics-and-catalogues combination feels somewhat familiar.</comment>
