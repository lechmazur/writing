<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mila's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—copying silence, weaving copper antennae, teaching dust to sing—with her diligence serving as both character trait and revolutionary method. The contradiction between preservation instinct and rebellion risk plays out in embodied choices, though some interior passages lean toward summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens builds through dust-teaching-story layers to a resonant reconfiguration where inspectors become unwilling students of banned narratives. The closure lands with visible cost (Mila doesn't flee, accepts consequences) and conceptual repricing as the city itself begins remembering stories through mist and chord.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove functions as pressure chamber where mist, rosin dust, and copper filament become tools that constrain and enable Mila's choices. Setting details—cracked seats, broken stained glass, orchestra pit—actively participate in the transmission plot, with the final image of the city's mist carrying chord fragments charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal preservation through clandestine resistance to city-wide transformation, with the solstice deadline creating genuine pressure. The deepening from copying silence to amplifying dust shows clear progression, though the inspectors' transformation arrives somewhat easily given the established oppression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—dust remembering bows, rosin preserving vibration, silence smuggling meaning—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Mila "notating tomorrow's clandestine overture on the parchment of the air itself" offers a resonant non-literal answer about art's persistence under tyranny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves musical terminology with resistance metaphor ("mist curled like forgotten sheet music," "rests and fermatas smuggle meaning") maintaining consistency. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") that occasionally strains against the intimate POV focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("dust retelling the famine of stories, violins mourning banned epics") risks opacity. Prose maintains momentum but occasional template structures ("She had once...but when...she learned") and compound abstractions slow key passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-as-resistance with dust-as-memory-medium offers genuine freshness, transforming familiar dystopian censorship through specific musical craft details. The pirate broadcast encoding stories in intervals (minor thirds for grief, tritones for rebellion) shows inventive world-building that serves both plot and theme.</comment>
