<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like the pearl warming against her palm and her confession about fearing "living rooms where no one speaks." The crown moment forces a genuine choice between witness and withdrawal, with visible cost as she becomes "porous" to collective grief. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional transitions ("collective weight") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (pearl's glow, mineral tears, confessions in stone) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara dissolves into the crystal veins as eternal witness. The cost is visceral—she loses physical form but gains purpose. Slight deduction for the orientation arriving late (bunker inspector role unclear until line 4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cave functions as active constraint and enabler—stalactites "like frozen chords," walls that "bloom with soft light," the nautilus spiral forcing her deeper. The crown and mirror aren't mere props but transformative agents. The final image of Mara walking "through crystal veins" makes the setting indispensable to meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: pearl warming → discovering confessions → finding crown → making her own confession → transformation. Each discovery narrows her path toward witness-becoming. The cost manifests physically as she becomes "porous" and ultimately dissolves into the cave system.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "walls between hearts" dissolving via witnessed confession. The final image—Mara eternally collecting and polishing abandoned hopes—offers a non-literal answer about how isolation transforms into connection through sacrifice. No explicit moralizing; the cost of connection is embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent lyric register ("caves hummed like a throat holding back a confession"). Strong perceptual signature in how Mara notices mineral details and interprets them as emotional states. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range ("latent radiance pulsing in slow Morse").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description + emotion + progression). Strong rhythm variation and sentence control. Deduction for two instances of mild abstraction ("collective weight," "shared ache") and one paraphrase loop around the confession theme that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker inspector role with mystical transformation narrative. The specific detail of confessions "signed with a date that had never arrived" and builders who "died of loneliness before the bombs even fell" transforms the post-apocalyptic premise. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
