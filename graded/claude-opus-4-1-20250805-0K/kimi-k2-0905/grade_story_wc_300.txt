I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered confessions, mineral imagery, and resonant accumulation toward a transformative merger rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details ("throat ached with collective weight") and her confession reveals character-specific fear of emotional isolation. The transformation from inspector to eternal tender is earned through accumulated gestures, though some interior moments lean toward abstraction ("walls between hearts") rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Mara becomes permanently transformed into the cave's keeper, with clear cost (loss of human form/life). The accumulative structure coheres through mineral/pearl/confession motifs that charge the final image. Minor orientation delay (cave location unclear initially) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal caves function as more than setting—they literally transform Mara through mineral tears, calcite responses, and root-crown integration. Sensory specificity ("air tasted of salt and iron") and the cave-as-body metaphor ("hummed like a throat") make environment inseparable from the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through deepening reveals (confessions→builders' silhouettes→mother's face) that reweight Mara's understanding. The crown moment forces decisive acceptance with visible cost. Stakes could be sharper earlier, but the accumulative tightening toward merger works under this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the concrete metaphor of inspecting tombs for the living while fearing living rooms where no one speaks. The final image of Mara tending "latent radiance" and collecting hopes offers a non-literal answer about connection transcending death without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with distinctive perceptual signature ("stalactites hung like frozen chords"). Compression and metaphoric density serve the accumulative mode. Some moments edge toward purple prose but remain controlled through the dominant mineral/musical register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language, though occasionally overwrought ("rainbows trapped in mid-sob"). Some abstract phrasing ("walls between hearts," "latent radiance") recurs without always earning its abstraction through concrete anchoring. No loops or scaffolding, strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of bunker inspection with cave-consciousness and mineral memory offers genuine originality. The specific detail of confessions calcifying into cave walls and the inspector becoming what she inspects transforms familiar post-apocalyptic material into something memorably strange.</comment>
