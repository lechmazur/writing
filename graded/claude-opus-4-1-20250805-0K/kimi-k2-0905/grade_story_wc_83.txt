I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens, as it builds through layered images of potential and loss rather than strict causal linkage, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's fall becomes another pool of unused potential.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—harvesting unlived lives to fuel "mechanical grief"—is hauntingly specific, with internal contradiction embodied through the geode's dual nature as wedding gift and weapon. The final choice to become "someone else's unfiltered awakening" through calculated suicide earns its cost through prior accumulation. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("intangibly tangible weight") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the protagonist becoming the very unused potential he hunted, his .003-degree perturbation saving a village. The accumulative structure coheres through the geode's transformation from wedding gift to repository of unlived futures. Minor orientation wobble in the floating observatory's introduction, but the closure's cost—trading his life for others'—is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory and desert crater create effective vertical tension, with the geode's fractures becoming maps constraining the hunt. Strong micro-setting work with "arithmetic workbooks whose solutions could redirect missiles." Doesn't quite reach higher bands because the observatory's specific properties beyond height don't deeply constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: each harvested potential costs geode fragments that "tasted like wedding cake," culminating in the protagonist seeing his own unused potential. The final perturbation calculation (.003 degrees) provides precise stakes. The "bleak exhilaration" of becoming death's accountant deepens into sacrificial action with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete metaphor of "unused potential pooling" in bombed locations, avoiding abstraction. The final image of wedding guests raising champagne flutes in the falling dust resonates without stating a moral. The story's examination of survivor's guilt through the lens of perturbation theory offers genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through technical precision ("perturbation theory," ".003 degrees") mixed with poetic imagery ("atoms mingling in the blast wave"). Some register drift into overly abstract territory ("intangibly tangible") that doesn't quite fit the otherwise grounded POV. The perceptual signature of seeing potential as physical pools is memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "fragments crumbled into stardust that tasted like my wedding cake" show excellent compression. However, abstract phrases like "intangibly tangible" appear multiple times, and some sentences strain with mixed metaphors ("mechanical grief"). The prose occasionally reaches for poetry at the expense of clarity, particularly in describing the geode's properties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of hunting unused potential through perturbation theory offers a genuinely fresh angle on survivor's guilt. The specific synthesis of quantum physics with grief, where small actions ripple through devastated systems, feels both original and inevitable. The risk of the suicide-as-salvation ending heightens stakes without obscuring the moral complexity.</comment>
