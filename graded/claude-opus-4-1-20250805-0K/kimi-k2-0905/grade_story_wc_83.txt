<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-driven transformation from victim to "death's accountant" shows compelling internal contradiction, particularly in the tension between survival guilt and mechanistic harvesting of unlived potential. The final choice to sacrifice himself for tactical gain demonstrates earned cost through prior causality, though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's calculated fall creating a .003-degree shift that saves a village—clear cost paid on-page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments of potential pool and accumulate toward this final crystallization. Minor orientation debt: the floating observatory's initial relationship to the crater takes time to clarify.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode's fracturing interior mirrors and constrains choices throughout, functioning as both compass and fuel for the hunt. The observatory's precarious systems (cooling circuits, helium sacs) create spatial pressure that shapes tactics. The desert-as-bride's-embrace in the final image charges the setting with emotional weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the geode's depletion—each fragment spent narrows future options while the protagonist races against the observatory's systems coming back online. The tension between saving lives and "harvesting unlived lives" creates moral pressure that tightens toward the final sacrifice, with visible cost in the irreversible fall.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of potential as resource emerges organically through concrete actions—harvesting unused vaccines, unplayed requiems, unmet lovers. The final image of wedding guests raising champagne flutes in the dust swirl offers a non-literal answer about how tragedy transforms into possibility without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through technical precision ("perturbation theory," ".003 degrees") filtered through grief's mechanical dissociation. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("intangibly tangible weight") that strains against the protagonist's emotional state, though the overall voice maintains consistency through the traumatic lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression, but "intangibly tangible" appears three times creating a minor loop, and phrases like "bleak exhilaration" feel template-driven when repeated. The technical language ("perturbation theory," "quantum telescope") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the emotional core.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conceit of hunting potential pools through perturbation calculations while grief-stricken offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of wedding bombing, floating observatory, and mathematical tragedy-harvesting feels non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, particularly the .003-degree precision of the final sacrifice.</comment>
