I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** based on its lyric repetition, pattern-based progression, and density-driven closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The historian's transformation from isolated seeker to communal teacher shows consistent motivation through embodied details like "fingers traced symbols" and "sweat absorbed by saffron veil." Her final choice to share memory's burden rather than purify it alone emerges naturally from accumulated pressure. Internal contradiction between preservation and erasure drives authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("atoms of nostalgia clustered around her throat").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she transforms from solitary historian to communal memory-keeper, teaching others to "walk steadily unpredictable paths." The cost is visible in her weathered hands and the burden of carrying "beautiful contamination." Pattern coheres through repetition of key images (bronze prism, saffron veil, atoms) that accumulate meaning, though the archive's nature remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices effectively through "defensive algorithms" requiring random movement and the chamber of "screaming equations." Sensory details like "air tasted of copper tears" create atmosphere. The wasteland transition provides contrast, though spatial choreography within the archive could be clearer. The bronze pagoda's transformation from building to locket to compass grounds the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from touching the pagoda, to navigating hostile algorithms, to confronting the archive's offer of eternal librarian role, to choosing communal memory-keeping. The "steadily unpredictable" path requirement creates consistent pressure. Cost manifests in her transformation from veiled historian to "woman with weathered hands," though middle development could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the final realization that "purification meant telling the truth slant, letting memory remain beautifully broken." The concept of memory as "beautiful contamination" rather than something to purify resonates throughout. The veil becoming a communal banner and atoms transforming from dust to wings embodies thematic evolution without stating morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with inventive phrases like "atoms of nostalgia" and "copper tears." Perceptual signature shows in how she reads the archive's intentions and sees "different versions of who she might have been." Some passages drift toward elevated register ("beautiful contamination of being human") that slightly strains the established voice. Repetition serves accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("fireflies, each light a small defiance") but suffers from repetitive phrasing of key elements across 35+ lines. Information density is high when describing transformations, though some passages loop concepts ("atoms of nostalgia" appears 8 times with varying effect). The accumulative design justifies pattern but execution occasionally feels mechanical rather than musical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a civilization archive that corrupts memory while demanding purification offers fresh ground. Transforming the historian from solitary purifier to communal memory-keeper subverts expected arc. The "steadily unpredictable" navigation method and atoms of nostalgia as physical presence show inventive worldbuilding, though some elements feel prompt-driven rather than fully integrated.</comment>
