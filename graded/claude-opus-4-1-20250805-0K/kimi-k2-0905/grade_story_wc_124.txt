<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's grief-driven motivation is consistently embodied through sensory caution and physical restraint, with the contradiction between his professional role (selling light) and personal need (preserving darkness/scent) creating authentic internal conflict. The final transformation from lantern broker to "broker of invisible gardens" represents earned character change with visible cost—abandoning his livelihood to help others grieve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered scent-memory associations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms from avoiding grief to cultivating it. The cost is legible in lines like "Each exhale released a small blue lantern of breath that drifted upward, carrying away a portion of the ache" and his decision to abandon lantern sales, though the transformation's mechanics occasionally blur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables Elian's choices—the UV panels reveal molecular architecture of memory, the extinct orchid responds to Lira's perfume, and the controlled environment allows "no full mourning, only exchange." The micro-setting of the crystal vial functions as both container and catalyst, with the orchid's transformation directly charging the final image of Elian becoming a guide for others.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to release suppressed grief—escalates through sensory accumulation as each inhalation risks unleashing "the sob he'd kept corked since Lira died." The orchid's sympathetic resonance and release of the hospital bracelet scent represents a meaningful deepening that forces Elian's final choice to embrace rather than contain grief, with cost visible in abandoning his profession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of extinct plants housing memory and the paradox that "every tear triggered by smell is a refusal to accept that the world can change and still smell the same." The final image of Elian guiding others to "kneel beside orchids that should not exist" offers a non-literal answer about grief as cultivation rather than erasure, though some passages edge toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive lyric-scientific register with controlled metaphorical density ("cathedral of invisible colors," "crystal shadows of fragrance") that supports the accumulative mode. Perceptual signature is strong—Elian notices scent architecture, molecular chains, and commercial aspects even in grief—though occasional register elevations ("the hothouse of the chest") slightly exceed the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines carrying multiple functions, and the prose achieves moments of exceptional clarity like "a ribbon of liquid moved slower than tears, as though reluctant to volunteer for evaporation." However, some metaphorical density in peak moments ("hothouse of the chest," "irrigate the desert of their lungs") creates mild opacity, and occasional paraphrase loops appear ("grieve in the way lantern brokers do: quietly").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of olfactory collapse, extinct plant preservation, and grief creates a non-obvious yet inevitable framework where smell becomes time travel and extinction becomes preservation. The specific detail of UV panels revealing scent architecture and the orchid's sympathetic resonance with human-distilled perfume shows genuine inventiveness beyond prompt assembly.</comment>
