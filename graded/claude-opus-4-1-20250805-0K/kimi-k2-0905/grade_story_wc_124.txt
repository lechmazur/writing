<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's grief is embodied through concrete sensory details ("sob he'd kept corked," "pressure behind the eyes") and his contradictory impulses play out in scene—wanting to grieve but being "aromatically cautious." The final transformation from lantern broker to "broker of invisible gardens" represents genuine character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered scent memories and UV-revealed molecular architecture. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elian transforms from selling light to "trafficking in crystal shadows of scent," with the cost visible in his decision to "sell no lanterns tomorrow." The orientation anchors (greenhouse, Elian, extinct plants) establish clearly within the first sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choice—"allowed no full mourning, only exchange"—and the UV panels revealing invisible architecture charge the final transformation. Sensory detail is exceptionally selective and purposeful, from "misting fans" to "soil that smelled of iron and meteor dust," with the extinct orchid functioning as both setting and active participant in Elian's grief process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (processing grief through scent in a world without smell) escalates from cautious inhalation to deliberate offering to the orchid, culminating in Elian's career transformation. The "olfactory collapse" creates persistent external pressure while internal conflict drives the meaningful deepening when the orchid releases "the smell of Lira's hospital bracelet."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete relationship between smell and memory—"every tear triggered by smell is a refusal to accept that the world can change and still smell the same." The final image of Elian becoming a guide for others to "kneel beside orchids that should not exist" offers a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through specialized diction ("esters," "capillaries," "receptor plains") that reflects Elian's broker profession while modulating with emotional intensity. Some filter-verb clustering appears ("he remembered," "he had answered") but doesn't obscure immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some paraphrase loops appear ("aromatically cautious" repeated twice identically). Template cadence emerges in middle sections ("He stood...He poured...He would sell") but the closure sequence maintains strong propulsion. Figurative language occasionally strains ("cathedral of invisible colors") without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a greenhouse preserving extinct plants after an "olfactory collapse" offers fresh ground, with specific details like "lanterns that burned without oil" and the UV-revealed molecular architecture creating originality. The transformation of a lantern broker into a "broker of invisible gardens" synthesizes elements in a non-obvious way that feels earned.</comment>
