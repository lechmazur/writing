<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against her mission's demands, with embodied fear ("counting breaths," "trembling glove") driving credible choices. The technicians gain specificity through names and physical fusion states, though their individual characterization remains thin. The protagonist's compulsion to witness and remember shows clear motivation that intensifies through physical ordeal to the final cost-aware choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's successful return of the technicians, with visible cost in her transformed fear from claustrophobia to "the wider fear—and obligation—of remembering." The causal chain from gold fleck discovery through phase transitions to restoration holds cleanly. Orientation anchors (undersea facility, 1987, Mara as spelunker) establish by ~100 words, and the drive lens remains consistently causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The phase-shifting environment that transforms "concrete to living basalt" and creates "a throat of stone that pulsed" directly constrains Mara's movement and choices. Spatial choreography tracks clearly from surface to cable vault and back, with the gold fleck's physics-rewriting properties enabling passage. The facility's architecture becomes actively hostile then yielding, making setting inseparable from the protagonist's ordeal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from witnessing the forgotten to physically merging with their prison-reality, with Mara's claustrophobia providing internal pressure against external necessity. The phase transition mechanism tightens options progressively, forcing deeper descent and closer contact with the horror. Cost manifests in her transformation from fearing enclosed spaces to bearing "the wider fear—and obligation—of remembering."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of bearing witness to the forgotten emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the final image of Mara carrying names "like heartbeat" offering resonant closure. The signal entity that consumes but also preserves creates meaningful ambiguity about memory and erasure. The gold fleck's dual nature as both trap and salvation avoids simple moralizing while the "copper strand between past and tomorrow" metaphor organically synthesizes the cable/connection motif.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive register mixing technical precision ("transatlantic lines," "phase transition") with visceral poetry ("throat of stone that pulsed"), creating a voice suited to both Mara's expertise and her psychological state. POV control remains stable throughout with appropriate perceptual narrowing under stress. The narrative stance effectively modulates between clinical observation and embodied terror.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with images like "fractal burns across reality" and "speed of regret" that serve both atmosphere and meaning. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("copper strand in the long cable between past and tomorrow") risks overwriting but maintains coherence. Sentence variety and rhythm support the descent/ascent structure, though occasional abstraction ("crashing hush replaced by ordinary roar") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of cosmic horror with technical infrastructure (undersea cables carrying otherworldly signals) offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The specific mechanism of phase transitions allowing passage between realities transforms the rescue narrative beyond standard templates. The image of technicians frozen mid-broadcast, particularly "silent broadcast that still traveled the cable at the speed of regret," demonstrates memorable originality.</comment>
