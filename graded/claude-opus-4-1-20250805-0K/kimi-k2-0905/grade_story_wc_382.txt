<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character work with the narrator's gradual transformation from student to keeper, and the tutor's ethereal nature revealed with purpose. The "agreed upon lies" motif effectively layers denial and acceptance throughout. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional states ("patiently nimble" remains more label than embodied trait) and the convenience of Mrs. Chen's immediate availability at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching of language/architecture metaphors building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator becomes the next keeper. Cost is legible in the tutor's dissolution and the narrator's acceptance of cyclical duty. The "stay" motif and brass seal create effective throughlines that charge the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and gargoyle effectively constrain choices and enable the final transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (meteor shower as Latin hexameter, steam as incense). The building-as-sentient-entity concept is well-integrated, though some descriptions edge toward the abstract rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes evolve from learning languages to inheriting a metaphysical role, with the tutor's gradual transparency providing visual escalation. The cost of becoming the keeper is felt through the cyclical nature revealed. Slight deduction for the relatively gentle pressure—the narrator faces no real resistance to their transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the "agreed upon lies" that become truth, exploring loneliness, connection, and the stories we tell ourselves. The final image of continuous borrowing/returning crystallizes the cyclical nature of teaching and learning. The building's desire to be understood resonates without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled metaphorical density and effective rhythm modulation. The perceptual signature is consistent—filtering everything through architectural/linguistic metaphors. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established voice ("dactyls of fire spelling out conjugations").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density and purposeful repetition of key phrases. Some figurative density in places ("meteors now fell in perfect Latin hexameter, dactyls of fire") edges toward overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Occasional abstract phrasing ("patiently nimble cadence") creates minor opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of language tutoring with architectural memory creates a fresh metaphysical system. The "agreed upon lies" concept and the cyclical keeper role offer non-obvious angles. Risk-taking in the ethereal tutor revelation and building sentience pays off (+0.3), though some elements feel slightly familiar from magical realism tradition.</comment>
