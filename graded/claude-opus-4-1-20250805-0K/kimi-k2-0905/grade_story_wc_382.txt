I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered metaphors and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from student to "keeper of agreed upon lies" feels earned through accumulated exchanges, with contradictory impulses visible when pressing the seal against the gargoyle. The tutor's revelation about her nature creates genuine cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—the narrator accepting the role of "new linguist" with Mrs. Chen as next student crystallizes options with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the tutor's disappearance mechanism ("she had never been alive in the way I assumed") strains credibility without sufficient grounding earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and gargoyle effectively constrain choices, particularly when the limestone "speaks" through the seal's impression. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("steam rose like incense"), though some architectural metaphors remain abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation—from teaching exchange to supernatural revelation to role inheritance—with the gargoyle's awakening forcing stance crystallization. The cost of becoming the next keeper is visible, though pressure could intensify more sharply between the tutor's transparency and the narrator's acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "agreed upon lies" concept brilliantly reweights all prior exchanges, revealing loneliness and connection as the true currency. The ending image of the building "conjugated in the present continuous, always borrowing, always returning" offers a resonant non-literal answer to isolation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with distinct perceptual signature ("meteors now fell in perfect Latin hexameter"). The prose successfully modulates between grounded tea-sharing and metaphysical revelation, though occasional phrases like "patiently nimble cadence" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("borrowed cup of sugar" as both literal and metaphorical). Some repetition of "agreed upon lie" serves the pattern but edges toward excess; phrases like "conjugated in the present continuous" demonstrate control while risking register elevation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of language tutoring, architectural consciousness, and cyclical mentorship feels fresh and inevitable. The risk of making buildings literally sentient pays off through specific execution, particularly the gargoyle's grinding speech "like a drawer opening after decades."</comment>
