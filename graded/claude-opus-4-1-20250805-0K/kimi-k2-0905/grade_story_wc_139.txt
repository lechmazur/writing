I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassidy's motivation is clear and rooted in grief-driven purpose, with concrete internal stakes around trading her last meaningful memory. The moment where she loses the lullaby melody creates genuine cost. Minor deduction for Julian remaining somewhat stock as the con artist father figure, and Rurik's transformation could use more embodied specificity during the ink's effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure with Cassidy successfully obtaining the asylum document through the ink's magic, paying with her memory—a clear Decisive Change with visible cost. The drive lens (Causal) holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Rurik's arrival and the ink's magic system not being fully dramatized earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The funeral home setting effectively constrains the encounter with specific details (formaldehyde/lilacs, embalming table, bone saw). The ink pot's physical properties and magical residue are vividly rendered. Deduction for some generic elements in the prep room description and missed opportunities to use the mortuary tools to heighten tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake (posthumously redeeming mother's name) with meaningful escalation when Cassidy activates the ink and Rurik's rigid convictions liquefy. The cost—losing her mother's lullaby forever—is felt and irreversible. Minor deduction as Rurik's resistance could have been more substantial before capitulating.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete trade of memory for justice, exploring how rigid policies can be liquefied but at personal cost. The final image of mailing the document "addressed in her own blood" resonates without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the father-daughter dynamic and the mathematics of fair exchange.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with strong perceptual signature ("granite policies into negotiable vapor"). Dialogue between Cassidy and Rurik carries appropriate subtext and tension. Minor deduction for some moments where diction elevates beyond Cassidy's seventeen-year-old voice ("refrigerated smile") and occasional filter-verb clusters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dawn was a bruise over the city"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("granite liquefy into possibility") and minor template cadence in the middle section. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece, though some sentences could be tightened for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The magic ink concept offers a fresh angle on bureaucratic resistance and refugee stories, with specific Ardhalian context. The cost mechanism (trading honest memories) adds originality. Deduction for relying somewhat on familiar con artist and corrupt diplomat archetypes without fully transforming them through lived detail.</comment>
