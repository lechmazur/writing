I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story operates through because/therefore linkages as Lira's discovery of the violin's provenance leads to her choice to play it, which causes empire-wide consequences.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between duty as researcher and moral intervention lands credibly, with the cereus's telepathic urgings providing embodied pressure. The choice to play the violin feels earned through accumulated knowledge rather than sudden epiphany, though some emotional transitions (particularly the "mulberry ache") lean toward diagnostic labeling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost - orchards freezing, empire falling, destinies rewriting. The causal chain from discovering provenance to playing the violin to consequences holds, though the coffee-stain divination feels slightly convenient. Orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice effectively - moonlight timing creates urgency, the cereus roots literally anchor Lira's decision. The ice violin's physical properties (melting, frozen body as "lung full of ancestral cold") directly enable the climactic action and consequences.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional duty to empire-level consequences through Lira's discovery. The tightening occurs when cereus roots wrap her ankles, forcing the choice between preservation and intervention. Cost is legible in frozen orchards and fallen empire, though agency feels slightly diminished by plant compulsion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the perforated destiny metaphor - choices creating gaps through which alternate futures leak. The final image of "orchards blooming out of season" offers resonant answer to questions of intervention versus preservation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("bruised purple," "old starlight"). POV remains stable with clean free indirect style. Some elevated diction ("penitent holds a relic") occasionally strains against accessibility but serves atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some metaphor density in opening risks opacity ("bruised purple that made every footstep feel like trespass"). Minor template cadence in middle section but propulsion maintains through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ice violin as weapon of climatic warfare against empire is non-obvious and specific. The cereus's role as both witness and compeller adds fresh angle to the choice narrative. Risk-taking in density and metaphor heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
