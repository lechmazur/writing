<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal conflict between duty and personal grief drives authentic choices, particularly his offering of gloves and the drawer pull exchange. The characterization excels through concrete embodied details like "palms empty yet heavier" and the moon calendar "etched under his ribs," though some passages drift toward abstract wisdom statements that slightly diminish immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the rope-casting ritual that transforms grievance into absence, with clear cost in Kael's "recycled mistakes settling into bone." The accumulative lens holds consistently through moon-phase patterns and ritual gestures, though the opening could anchor the immediate situation more quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet setting actively constrains choices—"protocol forbade metal that might sing"—and the mist erasure creates spatial pressure that forces intimacy. The drawer pull functions brilliantly as micro-setting, carrying cell memory that charges both the exchange and final image of "faint warmth" in stones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the moon-phase timing, the guards' fear-naming, and the rope ritual, each narrowing options toward forgiveness. The cost registers clearly in "pocket lighter without the pull, heart fuller," though the stakes could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the drawer pull's transformation from "opened onto nothing" to opening "drawers you thought rusted shut," culminating in the forge metaphor. The final insight about forgiveness as "not a sound but a space widened by absence" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice threads through "salt and regret," "squid grief," and "recycled mistakes," maintaining poetic compression without sacrificing clarity. The perceptual signature stays consistent—Kael notices through touch and temporal rhythms—though occasional elevated diction ("uncommonly thoughtful gesture") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "the mist pressed closer, erasing horizon until only the parapet existed." However, abstract phrases like "futures, not ledgers" and "between apology and forgiveness" occasionally slow momentum, and some metaphors strain ("borrowed bone").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moon-phase negotiation system and the drawer pull as memory object offer fresh angles on prisoner exchange. The rope ritual with named grievances transforms expected confrontation into collaborative release, though the premise itself (neutral territory exchange) follows familiar patterns.</comment>
