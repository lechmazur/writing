I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and temporal loops toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts dissolution into cyclical time.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's choice to seal the hawthorn rather than cross the threshold demonstrates clear agency with visible cost ("roots replacing veins, leaves replacing hair"). Internal conflict between preserving memory and accepting loss drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("texture of time") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from physical touch through temporal descent to final acceptance. The closure (sealing the fragment, accepting cyclical dissolution) lands with clear cost - she chooses to become part of the garden's eternal loop rather than escape. The transformation from "terror" to "comfort" regarding photograph dissolution marks genuine change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden functions as both setting and mechanism, with hyperbolic geometry creating temporal loops that constrain choices. Sensory layering ("wet memories of rain," "teacher's chalk," "funeral lilies") grounds abstract concepts. The hawthorn-hourglass and its transformation into photographic rings elevates setting beyond description to active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory preservation through temporal manipulation to existential choice about becoming the garden itself. The pressure tightens as paths collapse and the bridge disintegrates, forcing the binary choice. Cost is visible in the final acceptance of eternal cycling rather than linear escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and dissolution, with the final image of "time grinding itself sharp" offering a non-literal answer about memory's relationship to duration. The photographs' transformation from fading terror to accepted dissolution carries thematic weight without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation matching the conceptual ambition, though occasionally drifting into abstraction ("helical well of causality"). Strong perceptual signature in how time manifests physically. Some register elevation in peak beats slightly exceeds the intimate POV established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("sap barely dripped through," "planks curling away like burning film"). Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional abstract phrases that resist concrete parsing ("retrocognitively trapped," "asymptotic hedges") and some figurative density that approaches opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal mechanics with botanical growth creates an original framework. The concept of a garden as temporal periscope with hyperbolic geometry feels genuinely inventive. Risk-taking in the conceptual complexity pays off through specific execution (+0.3 within band).</comment>
