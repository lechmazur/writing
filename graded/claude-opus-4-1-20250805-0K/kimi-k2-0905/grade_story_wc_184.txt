<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to comprehend rather than possess drives genuine choices with embodied details like "fingers sensing temperature changes in the silk." The final palm-press authorizing return shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("confusion and clarity rotate like twin suns") that briefly distances from embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing cleanly—the clock striking twelve "prolonged until it became silence" while the door fades shows clear before/after with felt cost. The wax seal's transformation from closed to open door crystallizes the treaty's completion. Slight deduction for dense symbolic layering that occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mechanism room constrains choices beautifully—threads must be woven in specific patterns, the wax flows uphill into gears, the ceremonial rope requires precise manipulation. Setting actively shapes tactics throughout. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptions ("moonlight dripped") that prioritize atmosphere over spatial clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: seal melts → threads hover → memories reveal → final authorization required. Each discovery narrows Elara's options toward the inevitable choice to complete the cycle. The cost lands in the door's disappearance and time's fundamental alteration, though the personal price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The forgetting/forgiveness dialectic emerges organically through concrete action—the treaty that seals war memories until they can be safely retold. The final image of the clock measuring "distance between what was forgotten and what was forgiven" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Elara's archivist lens coloring observations ("habitually dating a page that the tower would never let her complete"). Some elevated diction ("ceremonial rope waiting for a hand bold enough to re-knot destiny") occasionally drifts from character register. Clean POV control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong moments like "each strand carried a memory: a treaty unsigned, a lover unreached, a child unborn." However, abstract formulations accumulate ("confusion into clarity" appears 4 times, "warmly methodical" 3 times) creating mild template cadence. Some metaphor density in peak beats reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive/time/memory concepts with the Meridian Embassy's treaty to forget war—specific and non-obvious. The mechanism as living seal requiring periodic human authorization shows conceptual depth. The transformation of standard fantasy elements (magic tower, mysterious door) through bureaucratic-archival lens adds originality.</comment>
