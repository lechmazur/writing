<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurelio's motivation as a defunct revolutionary is clear and consistent, with his poetic sensibility driving meaningful micro-choices (scratching the mirror, giving Mira the shard). The internal conflict between futility and the need to act manifests concretely through his blood on the shard and whispered verses. However, Mira remains underdeveloped beyond reverent youth archetype, and some interiority slides into abstraction ("footnotes could still be rewritten") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Conceptual Repricing closure—Aurelio's scratched line on the mirror reweights civilization's collapse as ongoing revision rather than ending. The cost is legible through "blood drying" and the acceptance of being "only footnotes." Minor orientation debt: the relationship between the storm and time visibility could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting actively constrains choices—characters must cover mirrors during storms, the Forum of Hours provides the shard that becomes instrumental. Vivid sensory work: "ribbons of chronal lightning braiding themselves into nooses," "time dripped from gutters like liquid brass." The micro-setting of the mirror and shard functions as environment that shapes the final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether memory/history can be rewritten—escalates from archaeological dispute through personal wound to the scratching of the mirror. The storm provides natural pressure that forces action during its eye. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation and imagery than decisive turns that narrow options, and Mira's presence doesn't significantly raise stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and erasure, with the mirror inscription "Civilizations fall; the poem remains, revising its readers" offering a resonant non-literal answer. The shard's transformation from archaeological artifact to writing tool to "constellation of selves" deepens without explicit moralizing. Strong subtext in Aurelio's defeated revolutionary status informing his poetic resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive baroque register with controlled elevation: "gilded coffin," "corrode," "molten pewter." The perceptual signature maintains Aurelio's poet-revolutionary lens consistently. Dialogue between Aurelio and Mira carries philosophical weight naturally through metaphor. Minor weakness: occasional register drift into abstraction ("symbolic, yet symbols were the only tools left to the defunct") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, though some sentences strain under ornate metaphor ("the baroque asteroid... like a gilded coffin"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing that slows momentum ("empires and revolutions alike were only footnotes in the margin of a larger collapse") and slight overwriting in figurative density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-visible-substance with archaeological dispute over memory creates an original premise. The transformation of revolutionary failure into poetic revision offers a non-obvious angle. The specific detail of "grains streaming away like luminous sand" and mirrors that must be covered during temporal storms shows genuine imaginative work beyond template responses.</comment>
