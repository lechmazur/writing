I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Aurelia's dissolution into the crystal creates the civilization she failed to build.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aurelia's internal contradiction between revolutionary failure and persistent idealism drives authentic choices, particularly in crushing the shard to complete her vision rather than surrender it. The embodied detail of "burnished sorrow" and physical dissolution avoids therapy-speak while maintaining emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Conceptual Repricing closure lands powerfully—Aurelia's literal dissolution seeds a new civilization, with visible cost in her physical erasure. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring mirrors/reflection motifs, though the archaeologist's transformation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting actively constrains choices through its mirror-amplified time storms and collapsed architecture. Specificity like "standing on a broken cello" and "mercury fresco where cherubs rowed boats" creates lived-in texture that charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal theft to civilizational reimagining, with Aurelia's choice to crush the shard rather than surrender it crystallizing her values. The cost—her dissolution—is unmistakable, though the archaeologist confrontation arrives somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ending achieves resonant non-literal closure as the "defunct revolutionary" becomes the foundation of her imagined civilization. The mirror/reflection motif accumulates meaning throughout, culminating in "Mirrorless, we become the reflection we sought."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("visible time," "burnished sorrow"). The prose modulates effectively under pressure, though occasional elevation ("lacquers all revolutions which arrive too early") slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. Some mild overwriting in metaphorical density ("ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood") but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of visible time and a revolutionary reimagining civilization through poetic dissolution offers genuine freshness. The risk of the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning, with specificity in "courts where judges spoke only in questions."</comment>
