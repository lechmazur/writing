<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking to understand the geography of healing through her unique trade. Internal contradiction emerges effectively as she realizes she was her own first client, writing her obituary in reverse. The final choice to return to the world "armed with the geography of healing" shows earned transformation with visible cost (seven years of absence from ordinary life).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through the weft thread's revelation and the garden's transformative space. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the traveler realizes she's been writing her own obituary in reverse, with clear cost (seven years of self-imposed absence). The final image of the garden spelling new names for future travelers effectively reweights the entire premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadowed garden setting constrains choice effectively—it's the specific place where her clients "appeared to go" after their obituaries. Sensory details like "autumn light filtered through bare branches like pale fingers" and leaves arranging into word patterns support the otherworldly atmosphere. The garden's active response to her work (shadows becoming portals) makes setting integral to the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing—is signaled early and deepens through the weft thread's revelation as "extracted presence." The traveler's kneeling work of unwinding the thread creates meaningful escalation as faces emerge and she recognizes herself as her own first client. Cost is visible in the seven years of absence from ordinary life, though the resolution could press harder on immediate consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "explained absences" becoming "presence waiting to be recognized." The recurring motif of writing/text (ink-stained fingers, obituaries, words in dirt, paths spelling words) accumulates meaning without forcing symbolism. The final insight that "every explained absence was really just a presence waiting to be recognized" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception focused on the traveler's unique profession and quest. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative ("geography of healing she'd sought") to intimate recognition ("she'd been her own first client"). The perceptual signature—seeing text and patterns everywhere—fits the obituary writer's mindset, though some passages drift toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "dried fountain" and "leaves arranged themselves into patterns," but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("she'd," "she realized") and abstract constructions ("lonesome splendor," "extraordinary one"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the concept of absence/presence. The final paragraph contains effective imagery but could tighten its recursive explanations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living who then vanish is genuinely fresh, avoiding template narratives. The weft thread as "extracted presence" and the garden as a liminal space for transformation show creative synthesis. The revelation that she's been writing her own obituary "in reverse" provides a non-obvious angle that reframes the entire narrative.</comment>
