<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to understand echoing drives every choice, with richly perceptive abilities creating embodied sensory detail ("taste the iron in a stranger's blood memory"). The revelation about her mother and subsequent choice to complete the farewell shows genuine character progression with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("webs of intrigue tightened around her lungs") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught echo mechanics that culminate in Lira completing her mother's unfinished departure—a Decisive Change with clear cost (releasing the trapped echo). The piece teaches its serpentine/spiral logic early and pays it off through the nexus descent and cocoon dissolution. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the closure lands with "ensuring her life would travel rather than reverberate."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon's basalt walls holding grief, the serpentine nexus with moth-weavers, and the seashell half all constrain choices and enable the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("reed-blown melancholy," "wet copper"). The setting actively participates in closure when the canyon "absorbed and released" Lira's voice "satisfied." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ensuring one's life doesn't become "a hollow vibration"—escalates through Lira's descent into the nexus, discovery of her mother's trapped echo, and choice to complete the farewell. Cost is visible when she releases her mother's echo and accepts the role of teaching others "progressive disclosure of goodbye." The echo's question "Why do you echo, Lira?" effectively tightens pressure at the midpoint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the echo/completion metaphor: "unfinished departures loop, while complete goodbyes travel on." The seashell becoming whole mirrors Lira's journey toward closure. The ending reweights all prior echoes as incomplete farewells without stating a moral. Strong resonance in "ensuring her life would travel rather than reverberate, a finished sentence carried by wind."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric compression ("reed-blown melancholy, a slow bend of notes") and consistent POV control. The prose modulates effectively from sensory perception to mythic register without head-hopping. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("serpentine nexus," "sonic residue") but mostly serves the piece's tone. Perceptual signature strong in how Lira experiences sound as taste and texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "echo" that serves the concept. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("webs of intrigue," "luminous threads") and some template cadence in middle sections ("She descended... She stepped forward... She pressed"). The closing image lands cleanly without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-as-incomplete-departure with the moth-weavers spinning sound into threads. The concept of "progressive disclosure of goodbye" offers a non-obvious angle on closure and grief. The transformation of the canyon echo singer role from trapped to freed shows genuine innovation. Risk-taking in the lyric-mythic register mostly succeeds in heightening stakes.</comment>
