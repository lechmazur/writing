<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "ensure her own life would not become a hollow vibration" drives clear choices through discovery and completion of her mother's unfinished farewell. The embodied perception of "tasting iron in a stranger's blood memory" and hearing overlapping voices creates specific interiority. The final renunciation of being "canyon echo singer no longer" carries visible cost as she gives up her defining identity to travel forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Lira completes her mother's farewell and transforms from echo-trapped to "ensuring her life would travel rather than reverberate." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and echoes build toward the revelation that "unfinished departures loop, while complete goodbyes travel on." Cost is visible in releasing her mother and accepting the old woman's wisdom, though the neat resolution of finding her grandmother slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus and moth-gallery create vivid micro-settings that constrain choice—Lira must descend to find answers, moths literally weave sound into threads. Sensory detail like "wet copper" scent and "luminous threads" grounds the fantastical. The canyon itself becomes agent through questioning echoes, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental rather than purely functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Central stake of understanding why some echo while others vanish drives the descent and discovery. Pressure tightens when Lira recognizes her mother's voice in the cocoon, forcing her to "finish what her mother could not." The cost of completing the farewell—releasing both mother and her own echo-identity—is clear, though escalation relies more on revelation than active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of echoes as unfinished departures versus complete journeys. The final image of Lira walking on as "a finished sentence carried by wind" resonates without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom about closure and letting go through specific canyon imagery rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and specific perceptual signature ("reed-blown melancholy," synesthetic blood-memory). Dialogue between Lira and the old woman carries subtext about inheritance and release. Some elevated diction ("serpentine nexus," "sonic residue") occasionally drifts from Lira's established register but serves the lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, though some sentences reach for elevated effect ("whose grief still clung to the basalt"). Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. Minor template cadence in the resolution section ("She would travel...People would remember...") and occasional abstract phrasing ("progressive disclosure of goodbye") create slight drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-as-memory with moth-weavers creating physical manifestations of sound transforms a familiar lost-parent quest. The specific solution—completing unfinished farewells to prevent eternal echoing—feels earned and non-obvious. The fantastical elements serve emotional truth about grief and release rather than ornament.</comment>
