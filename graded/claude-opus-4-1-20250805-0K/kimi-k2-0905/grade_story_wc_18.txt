<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's internal conflict between capturing and releasing dreams drives genuine change with visible cost. His renunciation is earned through the dream's revelation about his self-imposed boundaries. Minor deduction for the dream "speaking" feeling slightly convenient, though the embodied transformation compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - the protagonist's understanding crystallizes into renunciation with felt cost (dismantling his device, accepting limitation). Closure lands cleanly with the workshop transformation. Slight dock for the dream's communication method feeling abstract rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard setting actively constrains and enables the ritual, with frost, fog, and tree formation all participating in the magic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (metallic taste, weight of being watched). The transformation of dead branches into prisms charges the final image powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through deepening understanding rather than external reversals - from hunting to constructing to the moment of hesitation that forces the choice. The cost is legible (giving up his quest, accepting mirrors that release rather than capture). Slightly weakened by the dream's agency feeling abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the boundary metaphor - between waking/sleeping, capturing/releasing, stasis/growth. The final image of doorway-mirrors resonates without moralizing. Strong integration of the "firmly grounded" paradox with transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register and consistent perceptual signature (craftsman's precision meets dreamer's vision). Clean focalization throughout with purposeful rhythm modulation. Minor repetition of "firmly grounded" feels slightly forced but serves thematic purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and high information density. Some elevated diction ("irreversible," "inextricable") occasionally strains the craftsman's voice. The incomplete final sentence reads as intentional elision. Minor template patterns in "he would"/"he had" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craftsman-mystic with the dream-as-entity concept. The transformation from hunter to releaser offers genuine surprise that feels earned. The glass mountains singing creates memorable imagery, though the overall premise of dream-catching has familiar echoes.</comment>
