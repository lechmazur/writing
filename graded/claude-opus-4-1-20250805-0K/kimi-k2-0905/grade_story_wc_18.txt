<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's internal conflict between capturing her runaway dream and accepting its wild nature drives meaningful choices, particularly the blood sacrifice that repairs the sextant. Her use of synchronized breathing as both tactical method and emotional regulation shows embodied contradiction under pressure. The final acceptance that boundaries must be "breathed into new forms" rather than destroyed represents earned wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirror maker transforms her understanding of boundaries from erasure to breathing them "into new forms," with visible cost in her blood sacrifice and the centuries of fog lifting. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each breath cycle builds pressure toward the dream's reintegration. The orientation anchors (mirror maker, ruined orchard, twilight) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard transforms from skeletal decay to "bark shining like polished obsidian" as a direct result of the protagonist's choices, making setting causally active. The glass mountains shift from "solitude" barriers to being "rooted in soil rather than sky," charging the final reconfiguration. The mirror-leafed sapling at closure synthesizes all spatial elements into a resonant final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal loss (runaway dream) through physical sacrifice (blood on sextant) to cosmic transformation (centuries of fog lifting), with each tightening foreclosing options. The synchronized breathing creates accumulating pressure through thirteen cycles that narrow the corridor until integration becomes inevitable. Cost is visible in the blood sacrifice and the acceptance that she cannot possess the dream but must let it grow "orchard-rooted."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of "erasing boundaries" into "breathing them into new forms," avoiding abstract philosophizing. The mirror-leafed sapling where "each leaf she saw the runaway dream resting peacefully" offers a non-literal answer to the boundary question. The recurring breath rhythm (seven-five) becomes both method and meaning, integrating technique with thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The perceptual signature captures the mirror maker's craft-specific attention to light, reflection, and breath rhythms consistently. Voice modulates effectively from meditative opening through urgent pursuit to resolved acceptance. Some elevated diction ("supplicants," "luminous pane") occasionally drifts from the established register but remains comprehensible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages like "exhaled a plume of silver breath that mingled with the mist, rehearsing the rhythm." Some figurative density in peak moments ("aurora of childhood laughter, unfinished lullabies") risks overwriting but serves the accumulative design. Minor template cadence appears in the breathing sequence but functions as taught pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making, astronomy (sextant), and synchronized breathing creates an original magical system grounded in craft specificity. The transformation of "glass mountains of solitude" from barrier to "rooted in soil" offers fresh reconfiguration of isolation metaphors. The specific seven-five breath rhythm and blood-soldering of the sextant avoid generic magic.</comment>
