I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic transformation rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the reaper discovers he has been sustained by human sacrifice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's transformation from collector to debtor emerges through concrete discoveries—the atlas becoming a paper boat, the wax cylinders releasing trapped voices. The final recognition that "humanity's terror had been feeding him" arrives with genuine cost, though some transitions between realizations feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper's understanding that he exists through accumulated human sacrifice reweights everything, with visible cost in "unlived years stacked like unread letters in his ribcage." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the middle section's pacing slightly dilutes pressure before the powerful ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively participates—"constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice," the copper liquid that "reflected not his skull face but the brother's." The transformation of space constrains and enables discovery, though some descriptive passages could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: atlas monsters becoming sacrifices, star-sentences forming questions, finally the mirror revealing his parasitic existence. The cost lands powerfully—"every soul he reaped had paid some fraction of their death to postpone his own"—though mid-story density could be higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central metaphor of sacrifice as sustenance, with the final image of paper souls rising "carried by heat still rising from the shattered dome" offering profound resonance. The exploration of debt and forgiveness avoids moralizing while maintaining complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "boots grinding quartz dust that had once been lenses," "each word a bead of dew on a spider's silk." The perceptual signature remains consistent—a being who experiences through absence and echo—with strong rhythmic control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable images like "constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice," though occasional density issues appear ("Echo forgotten phrases" seems incomplete). Information density is high but some metaphors stretch slightly ("silver lice" works emotionally but strains physically).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a reaper discovering he's sustained by human sacrifice offers genuine freshness, executed through specific imagery (wax cylinders, paper souls) rather than abstraction. The transformation of death-collector to death-debtor feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
