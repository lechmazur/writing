<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pianist's internal journey from waiting to choosing agency shows clear motivation through embodied details like "cradling its brass corpse" and the final decisive action of letting the chime ring. Minor deduction for some abstract passages in the film-world section where emotional states become less embodied ("passengers turned translucent").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through surreal ascension into film-world, culminating in Charged Poise where she chooses reality over "looping forever, safe among maybes." Cost is legible in "seven years" of waiting and the risk of composing an "unplanned encore." Slight opacity in the film-world mechanics prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice brilliantly—the station's "clattered like restless castanets" destinations force decision, the film-world offers escape but demands sound-trade, the broken clock becomes architectural. The tidal arbor and cloud-greenhouse create vivid, choice-shaping environments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive waiting through discovery of escape route to active choice between safe loops and risky reality. The "film was not escape but rehearsal" deepens pressure effectively. Cost appears in trading the chime and risking real disappointment, though middle section could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the broken clock that still chimes, the film loop as rehearsal for courage, and "surprise, like music, only needed one fearless note." The ending's "Onward" destination and internal compass pointing to "where the next unplanned encore could begin" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("reluctant pigeons," "brass corpse," "iris"). POV remains stable through surreal shifts. Perceptual signature strong in musical metaphors and time-consciousness, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("steely longing").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("strategically creative fingers," "tidal arbor above the clouds that rose and fell on slow atmospheric breaths") and some opacity in the film-world mechanics that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conceit of entering a film loop to rehearse reality is fresh, as is the projectionist who "spliced memories the way gardeners graft cherry." The broken clock that keeps time through chime rather than hands offers genuine originality. Integration feels organic rather than forced.</comment>
