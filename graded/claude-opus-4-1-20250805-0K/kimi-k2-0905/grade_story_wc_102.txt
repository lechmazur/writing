I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where unused love transforms from calcified storage to active distribution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim's motivation roots clearly in the past-life memory driving her search for "where unused love is stored before it rots the heart." Her micro-choices (offering the jade, matching breath, stepping through the wisteria door) reveal consistent character under pressure. The man functions effectively as mirror/catalyst, though his characterization remains thinner. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully through the "hairline fracture" that both aches and heals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the pilgrim transformed from searcher to distributor, "slipping droplets of returned love into pockets, palms, the river's fog." The cost is legible in the released jade bead and empty wrist. The accumulative structure coheres through breathing/love/storage motifs that deepen toward closure. Minor deduction for slightly opaque middle mechanics around the camera obscura's disappearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct's wisteria-choked arches create atmospheric pressure that's "so heavy it felt drinkable." Setting actively constrains through the "foggy lucidity" and enables transformation via the projected door. The camera obscura functions brilliantly as micro-setting that shapes the central encounter. Sensory work is selective and POV-filtered: "every breath she took tasted purple, medicinal."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding/releasing unused love progresses through breath-matching, jade-sharing, and orchard passage, with visible cost in giving away Kwan Yin's tear. Escalation reads more as deepening recognition than causal tightening, appropriate for the accumulative lens. The "fracture in her chest" knitting provides felt consequence, though middle-section pressure could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of unused love as stored/calcified versus flowing/distributed. The ending's image of the pilgrim "slipping droplets of returned love" offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey. Subtext operates through breathing rhythms, the jade's warmth, and the camera's vanishing. The "red silk fluttering, a small flag surrendering to the present" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature manifests in synesthetic descriptions ("tasted purple," "foggy lucidity") and selective attention to breath/flowering. The lyric voice maintains consistency through spiritual-poetic register. Dialogue serves as compressed action ("I lost the address of the love I never gave"). Minor moments of elevated diction ("medicinal," "reciprocal duty") align with the pilgrim's consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the atmospheric opening. Some middle passages edge toward overwriting ("filament of unspoken love, the unused stuff") and abstract phrasing ("storage is not a place but a posture"). The closing image sequence recovers momentum beautifully. Prose serves the accumulative design but occasional opacity dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of camera obscura artist, spiritual pilgrimage, and breath-as-transformation mechanism feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of unused love as physically stored fruit in an otherworld orchard shows genuine imagination. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and synesthetic perception heightens meaning while maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
