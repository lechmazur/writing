I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category systematically.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered metaphysical imagery and translation metaphors, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira understands that "haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's methodical nature creates believable tension against overwhelming loss, and her micro-choices (transcribing magnetic patterns, planting the seed) reveal character under pressure. The mother-daughter relationship drives genuine emotional stakes through concrete action rather than sentiment. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("touching distance is the span between fingertip and memory") that edges toward philosophy over embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - Mira processes grief through translation work, transforming absence into presence. The accumulative structure coheres well with each translation/action building toward the final insight about haunted ambitions. Minor wobble in the middle section where cause-effect briefly loosens (the seed's response mechanics), but closure pays off the established pattern with clear emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor functions as both setting and metaphysical apparatus, constraining choices (where to plant the seed) and enabling the final transformation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful - "iron leaves clicking in Morse-like patterns" serves both atmosphere and plot. The mirrored sky creating an hourglass shape with Mira at the neck is particularly effective spatial choreography that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively through the translation process - from documenting absence to understanding presence, with the seed's activation serving as the pressure point. The revelation about her mother's "haunted ambitions" recontextualizes the opening conflict. Cost is visible in Mira's acceptance that love must "change shape" rather than preserve form, though the resolution feels slightly cushioned by the philosophical framing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the translation metaphor - absence/presence, departure/arrival, the grammar of loss. The final insight that "haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior translation work. The equation "love over time is velocity, and velocity over distance is home" particularly enriches the conceptual framework without becoming abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with strong perceptual signature - Mira experiences the world through linguistic/translation frames. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, from clinical observation to raw recognition. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("the physics of transition required symmetry") but it remains within a translator's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some sentences edge toward overwriting ("a waveform Mira could walk through, each step sounding a syllable"). Information density is high and most lines do multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing that slows momentum ("how a presence becomes an absence without collapsing the world") and some filter-heavy constructions in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of cuneiform translation with grief processing through magnetic/technological imagery is genuinely fresh. The concept that departed loved ones become "the grammar of the living" transforms familiar loss narratives. Risk-taking in the metaphysical mechanics (seed responding to sentences, silver plant drawing runes) heightens stakes while maintaining emotional truth. The specific synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
