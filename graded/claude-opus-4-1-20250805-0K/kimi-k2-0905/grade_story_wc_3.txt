I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphorical resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's methodical nature manifests through concrete actions (transcribing magnetic patterns, planting the seed) with embodied emotion ("voice cracking," "eyes blurred"). The internal contradiction between her scholarly precision and overwhelming grief creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional peaks ("love over time is velocity").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira translates "haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape," with visible cost (her mother remains absent, only the pattern returns). The accumulative lens holds as density increases through cuneiform translations building to the final reweighting. Orientation anchors clearly (magnetic arbor, after spirit's departure).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor functions as active setting—its rails become the planting ground, its resonance enables translation, and new planks extend the bridge at closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (iron leaves clicking "in Morse-like patterns she almost recognized"). The seed's transformation and the arbor's physical evolution constrain and enable key choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulating translations that narrow Mira's understanding from abstract "physics of transition" to personal grief resolution. The seed's increasing heat and the silver plant's emergence create pressure. Cost is visible when she accepts her mother's pattern rather than physical return—a meaningful trade-off that forecloses reunion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete translations rather than assertion: "The departed become the grammar of the living; conjugate them carefully." The final insight about haunted ambitions reweights all prior material without moralizing. The recurring translation motif accumulates meaning, particularly the equation "love divided by time" paying off as "velocity over distance is home."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows through Mira's translator's lens—she reads the world as text requiring interpretation. Some elevated diction fits the scholarly POV but occasionally drifts ("waveform Mira could walk through"). The lullaby provides effective rhythmic variation. Voice maintains consistency through emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("clouds vibrating into concentric circles") and occasional abstract phrasing ("gentle momentum of meaning itself"). The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("love over time is velocity, and velocity over distance is home") but inconsistently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform translation with magnetic sci-fi setting creates fresh texture. The concept of translating absence into presence through ancient linguistic methods feels specific and earned. The transformation of scholarly methodology into grief processing avoids template responses. Minor deduction for some familiar emotional beats despite the original frame.</comment>
