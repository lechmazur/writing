I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic transformation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied through specific actions like tracing the sextant's edge and rerouting dormant pumps. The child's laugh as "datum zero" and Mara's equation-building show character-particular interiority. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "optimism budget exhausted" and occasional diagnostic phrasing around hope as an engineering variable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the terminal transforms from "departure gates" to "arrival gates" with visible cost in abandoned infrastructure and city desperation. The sextant's journey from Mara to child creates coherent accumulative pressure. The pattern teaches early through "maze of intentions" and pays off with "solvable circuit."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices excellently—the exposed irrigation lines enable Mara's solution, the torn roof provides starlight for charging the beacon. "Glitter-flecked glass," "ion storms," and the hydroponic crater create vivid specificity. The terminal's architecture ("left for emigrants, right for deportees") charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: sextant vibration → pump rerouting → beacon repair → crowd arrival. The meaningful deepening occurs when redirected flows become "redirected purpose." Cost is visible in the abandoned terminal's decay and the city's "exhausted optimism budget" forcing evacuation waves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central metaphor of redirected flows transforming purpose. The ending reweights "departure" as "arrival" without stating a moral. "Engineers smile when math proves kindness is structural" and the child's "unbudgeted" laugh create resonant particulars that avoid abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through engineering lens—Mara reads structures for "vibrations" and "breathing," sees "nervous systems" in pipes. Some register elevation in phrases like "stoic wonder" and "maze of intentions" that slightly exceed the intern POV's natural lexicon, though mostly controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "starlight poured in clean lines" and "brass limbs bent like a bird with a secret." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("yawning mouth," multiple metaphors per sentence in places) and slight template cadence in the middle section's "She [verb]" patterns. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of hope as an engineering variable requiring "plumbing" is fresh and specific. Transforming an abandoned terminal through redirected flows rather than reconstruction shows originality. The sextant piece as both navigation tool and light-focusing mirror demonstrates ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyric-technical hybrid approach mostly succeeds.</comment>
