<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve heritage seeds for future generations is clear and drives every action, with internal conflict between immediate danger and long-term mission embodied through concrete choices. The transformation from captive to liberator is earned through patient strategy, though some moments of interiority rely on abstract phrasing ("staggering in its grace") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure follows the liberator from discovering the vault's location through the piano keys to successfully accessing and planting the seeds, with clear orientation and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where liberation becomes secondary to cultivation. The cost is visible in her choosing seeds over escape, though the final image of "counting measures until the harvest" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting constrains every choice—from using prize cellophane for arrow fletching to the Tilt-A-Whirl hiding the vault—with vivid sensory details like "dust rolled through the midway as the wall came down, sunlight pouring in like brass band music." The decaying carnival mirrors the regime's collapse while providing specific tools for resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal liberation to preserving humanity's future food supply, with the protagonist actively choosing to risk capture by delaying guards rather than flee. The tension between immediate escape and long-term mission creates genuine pressure, though the guards' easy entanglement in netting slightly undercuts the danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between carnival prizes (empty entertainment) and seeds (genuine sustenance), with the final image of planting after liberation offering a non-literal answer about true freedom. The recurring minor seventh chord pattern effectively links music, resistance, and growth without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with inventive phrasing like "patient as drought-grass" and consistent POV control, though some moments drift into elevated register ("staggering grace") that doesn't match the grounded narrator. Dialogue limited to one line but effectively uses carnival language to unsettle guards.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful metaphors, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("staggering in its grace," "staggeringly graceful moment") create template cadence. Some filter constructions ("She could not let them pass") and repetitive use of "patient strategic" dilute immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of carnival decay with seed preservation offers fresh perspective on post-apocalyptic survival, transforming the liberation narrative through specific details like using teddy bear cellophane for arrow fletching. The piano chord cipher and carnival ghost psychology show inventive world-building, though "staggering grace" feels like borrowed phrasing.</comment>
