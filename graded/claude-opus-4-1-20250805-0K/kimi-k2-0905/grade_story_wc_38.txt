<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is consistently rooted in her role as "the last of her kind" code breaker, with internal conflict embodied through physical dance-encryption that literalizes vulnerability becoming strength. The dice function as a concrete decision-making tool that externalizes her navigation choices. Minor deduction for the child's convenient reception of her code at closure, though the transformation is earned through her body-as-cipher sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dance-as-encryption paying off when Mara swallows the page and her body becomes the seed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (she must carry the data internally, risking herself). The spider's web provides temporal pressure that constrains her choices throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory functions as both constraint and resource, with water as partner/metronome shaping Mara's movements. Spatial choreography remains clear through flooded corridors, service shafts, and the dry archive sphere. The spider spinning between weather vane ribs adds atmospheric precision while serving as timekeeper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving/transmitting the scientists' encryption of human vulnerability) escalates through physical risk when Mara surrenders to the vortex and swallows the page. The spider's web completion creates genuine time pressure. Cost is legible when she becomes the living vessel for dangerous data.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scientists' project to "encrypt every human weakness into a single seed of data" and Mara's embodiment of this transformation. The final image of the child beginning to move "feet sketching the first letter of a safer alphabet" offers resonant payoff without stating a moral. Subtext operates through dance notation and the dice's verdict metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("moved as if the water itself were her metronome"). Perceptual signature shows Mara reading movement as language and feeling data germinate with taste. The prose modulates between precise technical description and poetic compression without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the dice are compass, verdict, and chance incarnate). Strong verb choices throughout ("germinate," "anchoring," "sketching"). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("calm defiance stitched into every pause") that borders on overwriting but remains controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of code-breaking, dance notation, and data embodiment creates an original premise where vulnerability literally becomes encrypted strength through physical movement. The underwater laboratory setting with bioluminescent journals and the executioner's dice as navigation tool show inventive world-building. Risk-taking in making the body itself the encryption medium heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
