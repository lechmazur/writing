<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassia's quest driven by tangible motivation (green dreams bleeding from emerald card) with embodied reactions throughout. The chimera's tri-form nature and Cassia's fracturing identity create genuine internal contradiction acted in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("becoming more herself by becoming less certain") that edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dissolution motif building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Cassia accepts memory's release. Cost is visible as she walks stepping-stones that dissolve under her weight, trusting ephemeral initials. Orientation anchored early (derelict carnival ship, Blackwater Bay). The ship folding into a pop-up book provides charged final image though the truncated ending weakens full resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices throughout: gangplank access, bilge-deep water, carousel slot mechanism. Sensory detail filtered through decay (popcorn butter and rust, sawdust glittered with glass). The ship's transformation into pop-up book charges the final image. Environment actively shapes tactics from navigation to the emerald card's integration with carousel pole.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the garden/twin memory) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. Meaningful tightening occurs when Cassia realizes the garden is "not a place but a moment" requiring memory's release. Cost manifests in childhood dropping away, reflection fracturing, and final trust in dissolving stones. Agency demonstrated through climbing carousel and accepting overlap with chimera.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory/identity emerges through concrete images: mirrors fracturing twins, name-tags on carousel horses, initials dissolving underfoot. The garden as moment rather than place offers non-literal answer to central question. Subtext operates in chimera's "unkindled" comfort and the ship's pop-up transformation. Minor deduction for occasional abstractness ("becoming more herself by becoming less certain").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyric compression ("fog thick enough to chew," "dreams bleeding green"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates effectively under pressure, maintaining texture through unusual word choices and syntax. The truncated final sentence ("trying to remember how to be") works as purposeful elision matching the dissolution theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and psychological state). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("blissfully aberrant sensation") but generally serves the lyric mode. Final truncation reads as intentional rather than error, matching the pattern of dissolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival decay, chimera mythology, and memory-as-place creates original emotional landscape. The concept of "unkindled solace" and memories stitched into carnival attractions shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending and lyric compression heightens stakes. The integration of paint swatch as memory trigger and navigation tool demonstrates non-obvious connections.</comment>
