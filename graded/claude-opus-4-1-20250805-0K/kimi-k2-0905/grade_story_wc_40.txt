<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from cataloguing certainty to witnessing acceptance is earned through concrete interactions with the crystal and library sounds. The final choice to leave the crystal behind represents genuine character growth with visible cost—abandoning her role as sole decoder to enable collective memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the pattern of collected sounds building toward revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara places the crystal beside the dictionary and leaves, transforming the library from repository to living testimony with clear conceptual cost—the end of defined language.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library functions as active participant through falling books and emanating sounds that constrain Elara's choices. Crystal's sonic properties and the pressed snowdrop create specific pressure points, though some descriptions remain ornamental rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as each captured sound reveals the library's hidden consciousness, forcing Elara to choose between control and witness. The cost is legible when she renounces ownership of the crystal, though the single-beat escalation fits the contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The final image of "zygote" as the last dictionary word reweights the entire premise—endings as beginnings, death of definition enabling birth of collective voice. Theme emerges through concrete particulars (snowdrop, specific memories) without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scholarly register with selective perception ("fingers tracing spines," "sediment" metaphor) though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("quiet apocalypse of language"). The perceptual signature of noticing patterns and fragments suits the character but occasionally loses specificity under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("weight of finality," "suspended hush") and filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop about growth patterns (inward/folding/return) reduces momentum without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a library gaining consciousness after language ends offers fresh angle on familiar post-apocalyptic territory. The specific synthesis of sonic crystal, dead dictionaries, and living memory feels earned, though execution occasionally relies on familiar literary gestures.</comment>
