<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent—she reads ghosts like broken elevators, fixing what needs repair. Her micro-choices (climbing the counter, pulling the ceiling crack, half-winding the spring) reveal a professional's careful calibration under supernatural pressure. The ending choice to carry ghosts in the mainspring shows earned agency with visible cost ("hairline fractures where the dead had slipped inside").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dust reading that pays off when Mara traces the spiral to the mainspring. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts carrying ghosts forward, with felt cost in the "hairline fractures" metaphor. The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The circus setting constrains choices through specific architecture (ticket counter, cupola, iron stakes between studs) that Mara must navigate. Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting that reveals usage and guides discovery. The environment doesn't quite reach 9+ because it enables rather than severely constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from initial bargaining through ghost appearances to the final acceptance of carrying them. The dominant stake—whether to engage with what the building needs fixed—tightens when Mara realizes the cracks are in herself. Cost is visible but could be more visceral; the "weightless burden" remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of repair—elevators, ghosts, and self all need fixing through careful engagement. The final image of installing the mainspring in future elevators offers a non-literal answer about carrying others' stories. Subtext operates beautifully through the dust patterns and the half-wound spring leaving "tension for possibility."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("misaligned counterweight," "ratchet," "mainspring barrel") with lyrical observation ("motes that drifted like slow confetti"). Perceptual signature strong—Mara reads everything as schematics. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("silk hat perforated by starlight"). Some minor repetition around "dust accumulation patterns" (4 instances) but it's pattern-taught and pays off. Strong syntactic variety and momentum, though "hairline fractures" appears twice in proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with technical repair work creates an original angle. The specific detail of reading dust patterns and treating ghosts like stalled elevators transforms familiar supernatural elements. Risk-taking in the lyrical-technical blend heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
