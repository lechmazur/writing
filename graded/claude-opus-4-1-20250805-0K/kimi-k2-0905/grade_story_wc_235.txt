<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between the chronicler's role of ordering chaos and her own temporal dissolution, with the jealousy of past selves and the eagle/body split creating genuine internal conflict. The final acceptance of the wheel over the ladder shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("feral nostalgia bite") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through scroll/grave/eagle layers toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of accepting erasure as continuation. Cost is visible in the grave image and the acceptance of the wheel's splinters. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, mountain) arrive promptly. Deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cedar smoke, birch bark texture, moonlight "sharp as glass," and snow as "blue glass" create vivid sensory anchoring. The cabin and mountain constrain choices (dreams pressing windows, snow erasing words). The recurring scroll and stone effectively charge the final image of monument to unrecognized narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of narrative control versus temporal dissolution deepens through grave discovery, scroll prophecy, and eagle flight, culminating in accepting erasure. The tension between chronicling and being chronicled creates coherent pressure. Missing a sharper tightening moment where options dramatically narrow, though the accumulative pressure works under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wheel versus ladder metaphor and erasure as continuation offer resonant non-literal answers to the question of narrative agency. "Every story ends mid-sentence" and the mountain wanting "its minerals back" create thematic depth through specifics. The unrecognized monument perfectly encapsulates the theme without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combining lyric elevation ("lungs full of cedar smoke") with philosophical precision ("chronologically confused"). Clean focalization maintains the chronicler's disoriented but articulate perspective. Slight register elevation in places ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") that occasionally distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and rhythmic control, particularly in the soaring eagle passage and the snow erasure sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract constructions ("grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live") and occasional template phrasing ("She understood then") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The chronological confusion and future scroll dated "seven winters forward" create genuine temporal vertigo. The grave as both prophecy and memory, and dreams dreaming the chronicler back, offer fresh angles on time-loop narratives. The specific synthesis of ranger duties with metaphysical dissolution feels original though some elements (birch bark prophecy) lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
