<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alden's internal journey from obsessive control to authentic confession is earned through embodied particulars—the punch "ticking with a pulse," memories "fluttering out" as physical holes. The contradictory impulses between mapping escape routes and confronting truth act simultaneously throughout, culminating in a costly choice to paint rather than map.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered confessions that reweight Alden's identity. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—the phantom punch dissolves into paint, the fortress becomes a blank canvas, and Alden chooses arrival over escape routes. The 3:07/4:07 hour structure and tunnel journey provide coherent causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel as psychological space and the cracks forming arrows constrain Alden's path meaningfully. Setting evolves from external rail yard through interior tunnel to observatory roof, each transition earned. Cedar-smelling mist "that tasted of unvoiced confessions" exemplifies POV-filtered sensory work, though some descriptions edge toward the ornate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of confronting unspoken truths escalates through increasingly personal confessions—from "white, small" lies to core artistic fears. Each punched confession lights a compartment, building pressure toward the final choice. The cost is legible: Alden must abandon his safe mapping practice for vulnerable artistic expression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of mapping routes versus arriving, with the phantom punch validating lived versus unlived days. The final image of "mapping arrival" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through the fortress's physical form as "stacked unread journals, canvases turned to the wall."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of an "analytically artistic mind" mapping invisible rails while throat trembles. Some register elevation in peak moments ("starlit vault in mist condensing") strains against established voice. The piece maintains focalization well but occasionally drifts into overly literary diction that doesn't fully align with Alden's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive phrasing weakens momentum—"starlit vault in mist" appears verbatim three times, "cracks in pavement forming arrows" four times. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("ultramarine," "sigil") without clear payoff. The closing image achieves propulsion despite these loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The phantom ticket punch as internalized artistic tool and the tunnel as psychological journey offer fresh angles on self-confrontation. Specific details like "3:07 a.m.—hoping to quit his obsessive redrawing" ground the fantastical elements. The transformation from route mapper to arrival mapper provides a non-obvious synthesis, though some symbolic convenience appears.</comment>
