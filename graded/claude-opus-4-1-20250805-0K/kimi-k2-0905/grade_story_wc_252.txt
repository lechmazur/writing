I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from dock worker to community leader is earned through concrete choices, particularly her decision to sing rather than fight. The internal conflict between "tenderness without danger felt foreign" and her ultimate embrace of "combative tenderness" shows genuine contradiction acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("heart tugged harder than gravity") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the island's physical transformation mirrors the community's psychological shift from violence to creation. The cost is visible: "the old ground dissolved into foam, taking Brine Jack's legacy with it." The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the whale's call pattern. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the when ("morning after").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as more than backdrop—it's the liminal space where transformation occurs, "where water met land in a fighter's embrace." Strong sensory work with "waves slapping her calves like impatient trainers." The floating island fragments create genuine spatial constraint that forces collective action. Missing higher bands because some middle sections drift toward abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the community can transcend violence—escalates from personal (Lira's choice) to collective (the island's inhabitants joining her). The whale's call creates meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Cost is legible: they must abandon solid ground for uncertain waters. One point off perfect because the middle section briefly loses pressure during reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through "combative tenderness" emerges organically from action, not statement. The scrimshaw's journey from weapon-bearer's trophy to ocean offering creates resonant meaning without moralizing. The final image of the "unmarked map the whale etched across the water" offers a non-literal answer to whether violence defines identity. Exceptional integration of physical and thematic transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with maritime vocabulary ("hawsers," "sublittoral," "kelp and will") that reflects Lira's dock worker identity. Clean POV control throughout, though some moments edge toward elevated register ("freedom raw and alive"). The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the singing sequence. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "timbers lifting like wings, foundations sighing seaward." However, several instances of abstract phrasing weaken momentum: "grace of someone who," "vibrating through sole and soul," "banner of truce." Some filter-verb stacking in middle sections ("felt," "saw," "thought"). The ending recovers with concrete action and clear propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of weapons turning to coral forcing societal transformation is genuinely fresh. The specific synthesis of maritime setting, whale mythology, and community reformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the floating island concept and collective transformation heightens stakes. The "combative tenderness" paradox offers original insight into how communities might rebuild after violence.</comment>
