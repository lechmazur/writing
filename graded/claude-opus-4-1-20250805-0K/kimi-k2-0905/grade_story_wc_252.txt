<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from dutiful dock worker to freedom-seeker is earned through concrete details like her "calloused palms" and the way she "heaved crates with the same grace she once used to dance." The internal contradiction between duty and motion plays out through embodied choices, particularly when she builds the raft while "humming the whale's descending scale." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "true nature" in later beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (scrimshaw, whale calls, glass orchards) that culminates in Lira's Earned Stasis—choosing freedom over reconstruction duty. The closure lands with visible cost as she leaves the community that needs her, though the "disappearing island" resolution feels slightly convenient. Strong causality in her progression from hearing the whale to building the raft to departing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as pressure throughout: the war-torn pier with "torn uniforms" in tide pools, the scrimshaw's vibration against her sternum, the black sand that "sang underfoot." The glass orchards and harpoon-in-stone create a dreamlike but specific landscape that constrains her final choice. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors like "orchards of glass leaves" that lack full sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freedom versus duty—is established early and tightens when the council arrives with reconstruction plans while Lira builds her escape raft. The whale's call creates escalating pressure that "pry[s] at guarded hearts," though the resolution on the disappearing island lacks the visceral cost of her departure scene. The harpoon transformation provides a meaningful deepening but feels slightly detached from the core conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the scrimshaw's motto "Detach, and the sea will unlock you" which reweights throughout as Lira literally detaches from the pier. The final insight about "stop translating your own heartbeat into someone else's language" resonates without moralizing. Strong subtext in the children's "combative tenderness" as they help build the raft while apologizing to the sea.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyrical register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm in passages like "Wind carried the kelp back to sea, weaving it into the raft that now drifted empty." Some elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "choreography of cargo") fits the POV of someone finding poetry in mundane work. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into abstraction that doesn't fully match Lira's embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the whale-call sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some abstract phrasing ("freedom: not escape but the moment you stop translating") and occasional overwrought metaphors ("cliffs dripping like fresh paint") create minor friction. The incomplete final sentence works as intentional elision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-war trauma with mythic transformation offers fresh specificity—dock workers don't usually get mystical journeys. The "combative tenderness" throughout (children knotting kelp while apologizing, Lira fighting for softness) creates memorable emotional texture. The disappearing island that "obeys only those who embraced the selves they had hidden" provides a non-obvious resolution, though it edges toward convenient wish-fulfillment.</comment>
