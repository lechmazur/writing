<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's internal contradiction between public shrewdness and private compassion drives authentic choices, particularly her disguised waiving of fees and the locket exchange. The "compassion, like tide, must return" meditation embodies her worldview through concrete imagery rather than abstraction. Minor deduction for Beto's characterization relying slightly on role (janitor with reflective patches) over deeper complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the locket exchange and "another cycle beginning exactly where the last one resolved," with visible cost in Marisol giving away her mother's photo. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns of kindness build through waived fees, envelope delivery, and the locket transfer. Slight opacity in the Wharf of Lanterns transition and the convenience of finding the research vessel prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt wind flapping catalog drawers "like gull wings" and Beto treating books as "sleeping birds" create vivid sensory anchoring that shapes mood. The derelict wharf and research vessel provide specific maritime texture. The library's constellation ceiling doesn't quite constrain choices enough for 9+, though it frames Marisol's reflection beautifully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of cyclical kindness escalates through the envelope discovery, the revelation about Marisol's mother saving Beto's nephew, and culminates in the locket exchange with clear emotional cost. The mistaken address creates genuine complication. However, the resolution relies somewhat on coincidence (Beto knowing the mother, finding the exact vessel) which prevents entering the highest bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "cyclical ledger of kindness" metaphor elegantly merges Marisol's broker profession with the thematic core, avoiding abstraction. The final image of dawn trucks carrying "crates stamped with invisible thanks" resonates without stating a moral. The locket as "freight that must change carriers to stay afloat" transforms a personal object into thematic vehicle with earned weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register with maritime-inflected diction ("demurrage fees," "manifest," "pennant") that fits the broker POV. Rhythmic control in "Before parting, Marisol pressed her locket photo into Beto's hand" shows intentional pacing. Some filter-verb clustering ("Seeing Marisol," "sensing opportunity") and occasional register elevation ("whimsical certificate of unpaid debts") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "salt wind flapped the card catalog drawers like gull wings." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Template cadence appears in "She studied...She left...She walked" sequence, and some elevated diction ("cautious exuberance sealed with a smile no spreadsheet could audit") occasionally strains the register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mistaken envelope address as catalyst for kindness cycles offers a fresh angle on coincidence-as-grace. The specific detail of "Wharf of the Lanterns" existing only on outdated charts adds originality. The synthesis of cargo broker profession with emotional freight metaphor feels organic rather than forced, though some moments lean toward the poetic-universal rather than staying grounded in specificity.</comment>
