<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's transformation from ferryman to story-carrier shows genuine internal progression through embodied details like "raw-knuckled hands" and the physical act of threading memories. The girl functions less as a character than as the promise embodied, but this serves the allegorical design. Motivation remains consistent and the final renunciation (abandoning his role) carries visible cost in the dissolved coach and transformed landscape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Conceptual Repricing—the coachman becomes "only a man carrying a single drop of every story." The palimpsest promise drives causality from seat inscription through needle-threading to final transformation. Cost is legible in the dissolution of his livelihood (coach) and identity (coachman no longer). Minor orientation delay serves the fog-bound atmosphere without harming comprehension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing constrains every choice—from waiting at the brake to walking the invisible ferry-plank. Setting actively transforms (river→sandbar→meadow) in response to the threading ritual. The rain gutters function as environmental timer. Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman's professional attention to sound and texture over visuals in fog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distilling thirty years into essence before silence) established early through the palimpsest promise. Meaningful deepening occurs when threading memories transforms both landscape and identity. The ticking gutters create genuine time pressure. Cost is visible in the abandoned coach and lost profession, though agency reads more as acceptance than active choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of stories as ferry-crossings, with the yarn needle literally threading narrative into physical transformation. The final image ("quiet place where words begin") offers resonant non-literal answer to the question of what remains after complexity distills to essence. Subtext operates through the girl's ambiguous nature and the palimpsest's layered meanings without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric density through compounds like "gloom-hill" and "spindrift serenity" without sacrificing clarity. POV control is exemplary—we know only what the coachman perceives in fog. The prose rhythm modulates from patient waiting through ritual transformation to quiet acceptance. Minor dialogue serves its allegorical function through compressed instruction rather than naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("fog-bound river crossing" establishes setting, atmosphere, and constraint simultaneously). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("spindrift serenity," "ambient awareness") but serves the mythic tone. Sentence variety creates effective rhythm. Deduction for occasional opacity in metaphorical passages that require re-reading, particularly the palimpsest promise mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of memory-as-thread that physically transforms landscape is genuinely original. The synthesis of ferryman mythology with metafictional commentary on storytelling creates unexpected resonance. Risk-taking in the allegorical mode and dissolution of realistic constraints pays off through sustained atmospheric control. The specific image of distilled stories fitting "beneath his tongue where words are born" feels both fresh and inevitable.</comment>
