I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through pattern and resonance toward a conceptual repricing about belonging and frequency.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete pursuit across continents, with her parents' disappearance driving authentic stakes. The pilgrim's "perpetually surprised eyes" creates a distinct character trait that shapes his worldview. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heart raced") in lieu of more embodied response, but the final choice to follow the frequency map lands with earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as Mara discovers belonging isn't lost but waiting on a different frequency - this reweights the entire pursuit with visible cost (her journey, her losses). The accumulative structure builds through reveals about the chip, the press, and the frequency concept. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay and some convenience in the pilgrim having exactly what she needs, but causality holds and cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient observatory setting effectively constrains the meeting and provides resonant atmosphere ("sandstone walls glowed amber"). The matrix chip's "microscopic constellations that matched no known sky" creates specific, plot-relevant detail. Setting doesn't fully constrain choices but supports the mystical tone and provides the broken astrolabe as meaningful staging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from tracking to confrontation to revelation, with Mara's search for her parents providing clear emotional pressure. The printing of the frequency map creates a decisive turn that reweights her entire quest. Cost is visible in her years of searching and the acceptance that her parents chose to leave, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily through the pilgrim's gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frequency/belonging theme emerges organically through the chip's properties and builds to the insight that "missing pieces aren't lost—they're just waiting for the right frequency." The final image of following "the frequency of belonging she'd finally learned to hear" resonantly reprices the opening search. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "frequency of belonging" but it's earned through dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting Mara's drone-pilot precision ("fingers dancing across her tablet"). The pilgrim's dialogue carries appropriate weight and mystery. Some filter-verb clustering ("watched," "saw") and minor POV uncertainty when accessing the pilgrim's mission completion dilute immediacy, but overall control is solid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves good clarity with evocative moments ("stars spilled across its surface—not printed, but moving, dancing, calling"). Several instances of telling over showing ("reading her expression," "reverent fingers") and some repetitive constructions ("She'd been tracking," "She watched," "She descended") create minor drag. No major loops but could compress scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of frequencies determining belonging offers a fresh angle on the search-for-family trope. The integration of ancient observatory, type foundry technology, and star navigation creates an interesting synthesis. However, the setup of the pilgrim arriving with exactly what Mara needs feels somewhat convenient, preventing higher originality scores.</comment>
