I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against publishability standards.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through pattern accumulation (star imagery, frequencies, belonging) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara discovers her path home through inherited knowledge.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation coheres around finding her missing parents through grandmother's cryptic guidance, with embodied tension when handling the chip. The pilgrim's "perpetually surprised eyes" reads as a label rather than earned characterization (-0.4). Internal conflict between skepticism and hope plays out through concrete actions of tracking, waiting, and ultimately trusting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the printed star-map reveals Mara's frequency of belonging, reweighting her search from external pursuit to internal recognition. The cost appears as accepting her parents' departure and choosing to follow. Accumulative structure holds through star/frequency motifs building to the printing moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient observatory constrains the meeting location and provides the broken astrolabe as witness to the ritual. "Brilliant dimness of twilight" creates atmospheric pressure for the star-printing. The matrix chip's "microscopic constellations that matched no known sky" and the hand press serve as precise tools that enable the revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Mara's search for belonging/parents, with escalation through the three-week tracking, the reveal of the chip's purpose, to the printing that changes her understanding. The moment of pulling the lever carries weight but the pilgrim's immediate cooperation reduces tension. Cost manifests as accepting separation from parents while gaining direction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The frequency/belonging theme emerges through accumulated star imagery and the concrete act of printing one's path. "The missing pieces aren't lost—they're just waiting for the right frequency" resonates without preaching. The ending reweights the opening's "star-watching secrets" from passive observation to active navigation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-person limited through Mara with selective perception ("sharp-eyed drone pilot's fingers dancing"). Some passages drift toward explanatory ("they found their frequency and followed it") rather than staying in scene. The pilgrim's dialogue occasionally sounds overly articulate for someone with trembling hands under mysterious circumstances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows control with varied sentence lengths and strong imagery ("stars spilled across its surface—not printed, but moving, dancing, calling"). Template phrases appear ("settled cross-legged across from him," "reading her expression") (-0.4). Filter verb stack in emotional revelation paragraph dulls immediacy (-0.3). Information density generally high but some redundancy in establishing the search.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of frequencies as paths home offers a fresh angle on belonging narratives. The type foundry matrix chip printing star-maps is inventive. However, the pilgrim-as-messenger and missing parents seeking their path follow familiar templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
