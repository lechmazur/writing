<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (climbing with "grim optimism," seeking what she cannot name) manifest through concrete actions like rolling dice and counting in primes. The final renunciation—not stepping through but letting the staircase forget her—is earned through her mathematician's understanding of recursive regret, with visible cost in her bleeding palm and the dissolution of her existence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (dice landing on edge, step −1) that reweight meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara recognizes the missed opportunity as "a door never seen" and chooses dissolution over stepping through, with cost visible in the staircase forgetting her. The orientation anchors (infinite staircase, Elara climbing) establish by ~50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as both setting and constraint, its perpetual motion defining the rules of existence where "time refused to accumulate." The chipped die's impossible balance and the blood-marked steps create micro-settings that enable key choices. The wall rippling at step −1 transforms the environment into the choice point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering a missed opportunity—escalates through pattern breaks (dice on edge, negative steps, blood marking) that narrow options toward the final choice. The cost manifests when Elara chooses dissolution over connection, the staircase "forgetting her" as the price of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mathematical concept of regret as "recursive function, always approaching but never reaching closure" paid off when Elara chooses not to step through. The missed opportunity revealed as "a door never seen" reweights all prior climbing, while the dice (perfect/chipped) embody the tension between ideal and damaged possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains mathematical precision ("2,357th step," "sigma symbol") consistent with Elara's identity while modulating with emotional intensity ("laughed, a sound like rusted hinges"). The perceptual signature—counting in primes, rolling dice "absently"—reveals character through selective attention. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines like "grim optimism of someone who believed the next turn might finally feel different" that advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("velvet-heavy with the texture of almost") but serves the accumulative design. Minor template moments but no loops or scaffolding at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical proof with existential longing ("proven—through mathematical proofs—that regret could be modeled as a recursive function") offers fresh specificity. The choice to dissolve rather than step through subverts expected resolution. Risk-taking in the negative step counting and the staircase "forgetting" the protagonist heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
