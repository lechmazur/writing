<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete gestures (palm on frost-rimmed window, knees buckling) and his internal conflict between survival guilt and the need for connection drives the closure choice. The transition from following a scientific impossibility (compass spinning toward nonexistent vector) to accepting mother's presence shows earned character change through specific experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers grief, memory, and impossibility until the final folding corridor creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where death becomes continuation. The cost is legible in "Years later—though years had lost their meaning" and the abandoned jacket, showing Kael's departure from linear time. Minor orientation lag (station's purpose unclear) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observation deck functions as emotional crucible—its three-cycle seal creates isolation that makes transgression meaningful, and the crawlspace "no larger than a coffin" constrains Kael's choice to enter. The "temporally stretched" starfield and phase-shifted station establish rules that enable the closure's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from memorial ritual to confronting impossible phenomena (compass spinning, mother's voice) to the final choice of leaving linear reality. The cost appears in the abandoned jacket and the line about years losing meaning, though the middle section could tighten—the crawlspace discovery feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The compass rose transforms from "beautiful lie" to true navigator, reweighting the meaning of "true north" from geographic bearing to human connection. The final caption "True north is whoever waits for you to turn confusion into exploration" resonates without moralizing, emerging from Kael's specific journey through grief's geography.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac register with selective perception ("each photon arriving like a letter delivered decades late") that reflects Kael's isolation. Some elevated diction ("blessed pariah," "temporally stretched") occasionally strains against the intimate grief narrative, and a few filter constructions ("Kael understood then") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the station hum beneath the shutdown, a lullaby for the blessed pariah") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register elevation. Template patterns appear ("He had come here tonight because," "Kael understood then that") and some metaphors strain (photons as letters). The ending's shift to omniscient "visitors would find" works but feels slightly detached.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The phase-shifted station as grief's temporal pocket offers fresh conceptualization, and the compass transforming from broken tool to interdimensional guide shows inventive use of the required element. The ending's fold into non-linear existence takes genuine risk, though some SF elements (time dilation, magnetic core flip) feel slightly generic.</comment>
