<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation to "map cultural patterns" and "understand what had really happened to the world's story" is consistent and drives her ritual. Her internal experience is concrete through physical details (ink-stained fingers, barefoot walking) rather than abstract emotion. The final descent with "pockets empty of coin but full of measured silence" shows earned endurance with visible cost, though some moments lean toward over-articulation ("reverse engineer the culture itself").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through layered ritual actions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartomancer discovers "an infinite regression of exits" and seals her work for the next inheritor. Cost is visible in the abandoned skylight loft and her empty pockets. The orientation anchors (cartomancer, loft, post-crash city) arrive within the first 120 words, and the pattern of ritual accumulation pays off in the fractal discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as more than setting—it projects inverted streetlights onto the grid, transforming cards into "monitors displaying a dead token's final trade." The measuring tape becomes a tool that transforms space into meaning. Sensory details (coins falling into empty wallet, thunder timing) are selective and support the mapping ritual rather than cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding cultural collapse through cartographic divination—builds through ritual accumulation. The discovery of "a repeating sigil of leveraged debt" that recurs "no matter how she multiplied paths" represents a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge. The cost appears in her acceptance that "no human wanted to hear the prophecy anymore," though agency remains primarily observational rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete action of mapping collapse, not abstract statements. The inherited mystery from her grandmother who "mapped refugee routes in exchange for bread" creates thematic continuity without forcing parallels. The final image of footprints as potential "currency when every other ledger lay broken" offers a non-literal answer about value and testimony in collapsed systems.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary density with controlled rhythm ("Each droplet that struck the glass above her sounded like a coin falling into an empty wallet"). The perceptual signature is distinctive—she measures atmospheric pressure as "cultural barometrics," sees cards as circuit diagrams. No dialogue to evaluate, but the single whispered line fits the ritualistic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose occasionally tips into overwriting ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "steadily curious hunger") with elevated diction that strains in places. Some metaphor mixing occurs (cards as both circuit diagrams and monitors). However, sentence variety is strong, and the measuring/mapping language creates coherent texture. The piece avoids loops and maintains forward momentum despite dense figuration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of tarot reading with technical analysis of market collapse offers a non-obvious synthesis. The specific detail of "bite marks from a decade of gallery installations" on the measuring tape adds lived texture. The concept of reverse-engineering culture through divination cartography, while treating footprints as data points, shows genuine originality beyond surface quirk.</comment>
