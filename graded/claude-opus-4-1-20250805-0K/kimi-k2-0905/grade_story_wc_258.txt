I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and pattern-mapping rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation to "reverse engineer the culture itself" drives concrete actions—spreading cards, measuring grids, walking barefoot to collect data points. Internal conflict emerges between her former profit-driven readings and current archeological impulse. The inherited mystery from her grandmother adds weight to her final choice to leave the pattern for others.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the cartomancer's discovery of "an infinite regression of exits" that transforms her mapping quest into acceptance of cyclical collapse. Cost is legible in her descent with "pockets empty of coin but full of measured silence." The accumulative structure coheres, though the middle sections could tighten their pressure toward this crystallization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as more than setting—it becomes a camera obscura projecting the city's collapse onto her work, while rain sounds like "coins falling into an empty wallet" anchor the post-crash atmosphere. The measuring tape's "bite marks from a decade of gallery installations" and the grid becoming "Cartesian quadrants" make the space both tool and canvas for her divination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through the cartomancer's methodical process: from personal curiosity to cultural archaeology to the discovery of "leveraged debt" patterns that recur fractally. The revelation of infinite regression at "the intersection of the Ten of Swords and the Four of Pentacles" provides meaningful deepening, though more intermediate pressure points would strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of cyclical collapse emerges organically through the discovered pattern of "leveraged hope" and the final image of "footprints alone...as currency when every other ledger lay broken." The story resists moralizing, letting the cartomancer's measured silence and the ghost protocol she leaves speak to cultural memory and witness without declaring meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice control is exceptional—"onyx-ink cartomancer," "rain-beaded skylight," "fractal of leveraged hope" create distinctive texture. The prose modulates from meditative observation to urgent discovery ("she saw it: a repeating sigil"). The sustained metaphorical system (cards as cultural data, measuring as divination) never breaks character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "Each droplet...sounded like a coin falling into an empty wallet, a memory she could not shake since the cryptocurrency crashes." Some passages edge toward overwriting ("infinite regression of exits, each door opening onto another rain-beaded loft") but the figurative language serves the accumulative design rather than obscuring it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of tarot divination with data visualization to map cultural collapse is genuinely original. The story transforms fortune-telling tropes through specific details like "Cartesian quadrants where meaning could be plotted like coordinates" and the measuring tape as "secular relic." The risk of merging mysticism with systematic analysis pays off in the fractal discovery.</comment>
