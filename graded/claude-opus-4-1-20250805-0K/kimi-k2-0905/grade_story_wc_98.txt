<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calyx's internal conflict between duty and self-preservation manifests concretely through the seed bargain, with the cost of losing her teacher's memory embodied in specific sensory details ("coppery ink," "sound of her teacher's laughter"). The choice to sacrifice personal memory for collective preservation is earned through prior setup, though some interior passages lean toward abstract rather than embodied ("empirically whimsical tug").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Calyx's sacrifice transforms both the ridge and herself, with visible cost in her hollowed memory. The dream-bower sequence effectively deepens pressure through the fissure discovery and seed bargain, though the orientation of the Aya's exact nature could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge functions as both setting and stakes, with vanilla tendrils, basalt warmth, and orchid fibers creating a lived-in tactile world that constrains choices (the monsoon deadline, the dream-bower's physical requirements). The dragon-scale metaphor within the dream effectively mirrors the geological reality, though some descriptions prioritize beauty over pressure ("moonlit fish" smiles).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the ridge through collective memory—escalates from verification to active intervention when Calyx discovers the fissure, with the monsoon providing temporal pressure and the seed bargain forcing a genuine trade-off. The cost is legible in both the lost memory and the paradox of a reality checker who must embrace "luminous doubt" to succeed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the paradox that "cultural memory survives not because it is true but because people keep agreeing to guard it while knowing they might be wrong," with the final image of the ridge held up by "collective refusal to decide which half mattered more" offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The recurring motif of "luminous doubt" gains depth as it transforms from the Aya's greeting to Calyx's final state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mythic-lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signatures ("lucid-dust in her pupils," "empirically whimsical hush") that reflect Calyx's role as reality checker, and the dream sequence cleanly shifts psychic distance without breaking focalization. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("trembled with pre-monsoon light") but generally serve the fantastical tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the opening establishes character, setting, conflict, and tone simultaneously), though some passages contain ornamental modifiers that slow momentum ("luminous," "empirically whimsical" appear multiple times). The final paragraph's philosophical summary, while thematically apt, shifts from scene to exposition in a way that slightly dulls the closure's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a "fantasy island reality checker" who must sacrifice certainty to preserve uncertain memory offers a fresh angle on memory/reality themes, with specific world-building details like the "Orchard of Unwritten Books" and "lucid-dust pupils" creating originality. The synthesis of geological erosion with cultural memory erosion feels organic rather than forced.</comment>
