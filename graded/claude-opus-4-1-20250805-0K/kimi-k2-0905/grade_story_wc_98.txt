I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural drive lens, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Calyx's sacrifice enables the ridge's survival through "luminous doubt."

<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Calyx's internal contradiction between duty as reality checker and self-preservation drives genuine tension, culminating in her choice to sacrifice her mentor's memory. The Aya's collective consciousness and Elder Numa provide relational pressure that forces the decisive trade. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the memory-for-knowledge exchange mechanism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—Calyx's sacrifice transforms both ridge and checker through the paradox of "luminous doubt" binding stronger than belief. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (orchids, basalt, copper ink) build toward the crystallized ending where uncertainty becomes strength. Cost is visible in the "hollow where a mentor's name had been."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridge-as-dragon metaphor brilliantly constrains choice—the fissure literally threatens collapse, forcing Calyx's decision. Sensory specificity (vanilla tendrils, storm-cooled air, coppery ink) creates visceral presence. The dream-bower's "humming pollen" and shared breathing rhythm make the fantastical tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the discovered fissure—from verifying erosion to preventing cultural annihilation. The monsoon clock creates genuine urgency ("time is a wave eroding hesitation"). The cost manifests concretely: Calyx loses her teacher's memory to save the Aya's collective ones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox that "cultural memory survives not because it is true but because people keep agreeing to guard it while knowing they might be wrong." The recurring orchid/petal imagery accumulates meaning, and the final "empirically whimsical" echo reweights the opening's uncertainty as necessary strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision throughout—"each orchid and vine glowing as though unsure it existed" establishes the perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, tightening during Calyx's decision. The sustained metaphorical register (dragon-scales, memory-petals) never breaks character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is exceptional—nearly every line advances both literal and symbolic registers. Minor deductions for occasional opacity ("empirically whimsical hush") and one instance of slight redundancy in the dream sequence description. The "luminous doubt" repetition works as pattern, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of reality-checking through dream-interpretation and memory-sacrifice is genuinely fresh. The solution—that doubt binds stronger than belief—subverts expectations while feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in the metaphysical premise and lyrical density heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
