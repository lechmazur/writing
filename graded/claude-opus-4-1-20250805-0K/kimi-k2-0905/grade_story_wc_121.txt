<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied perception ("rainwater bead and fall upward," "wounds leak hours instead of blood") and meaningful internal conflict between versions of self. The confrontation with elder-Kael crystallizes choice with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("maze of versions") and the final boy-in-room image lacking sufficient embodied detail to fully land the emotional weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught fractures and recursive timeline logic. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael smashes the tablet and walks through the doorway, with cost visible in "offering his weight in exchange for a name." Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who Kael is emerges gradually) and the boy-in-room resolution feeling somewhat disconnected from the viaduct journey's established stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory work ("air tasted of copper pennies and ozone," "algae bred by neon rain") with the viaduct functioning as active constraint. The fractured timeline setting shapes every choice. Slightly weakened by abstract descriptions ("Archive of Unfinished Hours") that don't fully ground in physical reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on conquering "the labyrinth of self" with escalation through fractures, ghost-Kaels, and confronting the elder version. The tablet-smashing provides decisive agency with clear cost. However, the abstract nature of the self-labyrinth concept prevents stakes from feeling fully visceral, and the boy-in-room resolution doesn't fully pay off the established conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence around cyclical time, self-confrontation, and the weight of choices across iterations. The "minotaur at its heart" revelation elegantly reframes the journey. The recurring drop/ripple motif effectively brackets and charges the narrative. Minor deduction for the father's clock collection feeling somewhat disconnected from the main thematic thread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric density ("boots leaving no prints on the wet stone," "runes pulsing like dying stars"). Perceptual signature strong throughout with selective attention to temporal anomalies. Clean POV control with no head-hopping. The prose rhythm effectively modulates with pressure, accelerating during the fracture sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, several instances of purple prose ("cathedral bones," "a beast stitched from every moment") and abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures clarity. Some repetitive constructions ("Kael stepped," "Kael walked," "Kael understood") create mild template cadence. Information density high but sometimes sacrifices clarity for style.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-manipulation and self-confrontation with the "periodically eternal" tablet concept. The procedural generation path-finding and gravity-defying elements create original texture. The specific detail of "3:19 A.M. in cities that never learned their own names" shows strong imaginative reach. Risk-taking with fractured narrative structure heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
