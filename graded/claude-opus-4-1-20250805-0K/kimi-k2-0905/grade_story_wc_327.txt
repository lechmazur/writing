I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and sensory transformation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation to preserve a dying language drives her sacrifice with clear internal logic. Her acceptance of the curse in exchange for linguistic preservation shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The transformation sequence embodies her emotional state through copper veins lighting "like filaments," though some passages lean toward abstract description rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the storyteller's calcification transforms her into a conduit for the lost language, with visible cost paid through her physical death. The accumulative structure builds through textural layers—from listening to bone towers through swallowing the diamond to final statue form. Minor orientation delays (canyon location emerges gradually) don't harm the closure's power.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes and bone towers function as active setting that constrains choices and enables the transformation. Sensory details like "texture—roughness of reeds, slickness of wet clay" and "air felt textured, like running one's tongue over unglazed pottery" create visceral specificity. The environment literally becomes the mechanism for preservation, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from preserving memory to accepting the curse to complete calcification. The storyteller's agency drives each deepening—pressing ear to wall, descending tunnel, swallowing diamond—with mounting cost visible in her slowing heartbeat and bodily transformation. The trade-off between life and voice preservation lands with clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete transformation of texture into sound, avoiding abstract statements. The final image of travelers "speaking in textures—sand-dune consonants, clay-vowel pauses" offers a non-literal answer to preservation through metamorphosis. The piece resists simple loss/preservation binaries, showing how language continues through physical transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "copper-veined storyteller," "towers of bone hum their thousand-year lament." POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance. Some passages edge toward elevated register ("migratory flock of meaning") but the perceptual signature—focusing on texture and sound—remains character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("quietly articulate fingers," used twice). Information flows well with varied sentence structures. Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("copper veins like loose wires") without clear payoff, and minor synonym repetition around texture/sound concepts reduces momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of language preservation through bodily sacrifice, avoiding clichéd "last speaker" tropes. The specific detail of texture-to-sound translation and the copper-veined physiology create memorable particularity. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and acceptance of death as creative act elevate the piece beyond safe middle choices.</comment>
