<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to recover stolen memories drives consistent choices throughout, with concrete embodied details like "gloved fingers trembling" and the internal contradiction between choosing "safety of forgetting over the pain of loss." The final choice to harvest rather than complete the exchange shows earned agency with visible cost, though some moments edge toward over-articulation ("chronically curious ache").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as memories return and Mara accepts "she would never again trade wonder for forgetting." The cost is legible in the withering fairy ring and the "tannic edge" of recovered pain. Minor orientation delay (greenhouse interior unclear initially) costs 0.3, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off richly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse with shipwrecks creates a vivid, constraining environment where "peach trees grew upside-down from the greenhouse ceiling" and details like "salt-crystal leaves" ground every beat. The setting directly shapes choices—the fairy ring's location, the sextant discovery, the final hillside position—making it indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of recovering memories escalates through discovery of the sextant, realization about voluntary forgetting, and the crucial decision to harvest rather than complete the exchange. Cost accumulates clearly: "the final forgetting" versus keeping painful memories with their "tannic edge."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between forgetting and remembering, with the fairy ring serving as a physical manifestation of this choice. The final insight that "curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home" resonates without moralizing, and the mother's hand "offering back the rain" reweights the entire journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled distance and poetic compression ("laughing tide," "constellation of bruises"), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("chronically curious ache"). The perceptual signature is strong—Mara notices fungal patterns, nautical instruments, botanical inversions—but occasional template phrases ("stepped through," "knelt") slightly diminish distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, but template cadence appears ("She whispered...She opened...She snapped on...She lifted") and some figurative density crowds peak moments without clear payoff. The "chronically curious" repetition feels forced rather than pattern-taught. Information density is high and momentum mostly sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The inverted greenhouse with shipwrecks as architecture and mushrooms storing memories offers a fresh synthesis of folklore and personal loss. The specific detail of "seven dark specks that matched the Pleiades" and memories corresponding to lost stars creates originality through particular rather than gimmick.</comment>
