<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's progression from fragmented memory to recovery is earned through concrete choices—cutting the mushroom instead of completing the exchange demonstrates agency under pressure. The internal contradiction between her "chronically curious" nature and the safety of forgetting creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some emotional summarizing ("the chronically curious ache...suddenly quiet") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memory recovery and symbolic accumulation (shipwrecks, mushrooms, sextant). The closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara recovers her memories by refusing the exchange and harvesting the mushroom instead, with visible cost in the "withering" fairy ring and the price of confronting painful loss. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, returning folklorist) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse functions as more than setting—it constrains Mara's choices through its architecture of "ship ribs" and "half-submerged" spaces while the inverted peach trees and fairy rings create a dreamlike logic that supports the memory-theft premise. The sextant's "seven shards that reflected her face at different ages" transforms a simple object into a mechanism that charges the final recovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) escalates through Mara's discovery that she "offered" them rather than had them stolen, forcing a recalibration of agency. The tension peaks when she must choose between completing the exchange for "the safety of forgetting" or cutting the mushroom to reclaim painful memories, with the cost visible in accepting "the pain of loss."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory as both burden and treasure emerges through concrete particulars—the fairy ring that appears in family photos, the sextant's fractured reflections, the mother's hand "offering back the rain." The final insight that "curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home" reweights the entire journey without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("habits are just stories we keep telling").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("salt-crystal leaves," "roots dangling like chandeliers") that reflects Mara's folklorist attention to pattern and detail. Some filter-verb clustering ("She realized," "she noticed," "She watched") slightly dulls immediacy in the middle section. The free indirect style works well when tracking Mara's shifting understanding of her own complicity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("accordion her father played the night the ships sank into the orchard"), but several instances of telling over showing ("chronically curious ache," "felt less like rust") and some repetitive phrasing around memory and forgetting reduce propulsion. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformed meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a sunken orchard greenhouse where memories can be traded through fairy ring mushrooms offers genuine freshness, combining folkloric elements with psychological insight. The specific detail of the Pleiades constellation mapped onto mushroom bruises and the inverted peach trees create memorable imagery, though the resolution follows somewhat expected patterns of choosing painful truth over comfortable forgetting.</comment>
