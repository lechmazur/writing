<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from skeptic to believer is earned through concrete action—she sacrifices her color vision to restore the memory, a visceral cost that grounds the arc. The internal contradiction between her public persona and private haunting creates genuine tension throughout. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("ghostly resolve of every archived citizen") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's act transforms the garden into a public archive, with visible cost (color-blindness) paid on page. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as sensory details build toward the final communal transformation. The piece teaches its metaphorical logic early (garden as bruise, memory as contagion) and pays it off at closure when strangers hum the freed lullaby.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet garden functions as both setting and mechanism—its transformation from private space to public archive constrains and enables the central choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (indigo hedges "soft as funeral clothes," pond "black as vinyl"). The garden's agency in replaying memory and accepting payment elevates it beyond mere backdrop, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recovering quarantined memory) escalates through concrete cost—Mara must sacrifice color vision syllable by syllable as she transfers the memory. The tightening is visceral: "each syllable she sang cost a corresponding color from her vision." Minor deduction for the resolution's ease once the mechanism is understood; the Bureau's opposition remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of isolation into shared experience without explicit moralizing. The final image of strangers humming the once-quarantined lullaby offers a non-literal answer to questions of memory ownership and state control. The recurring three-note lullaby accumulates meaning from personal trauma to collective resistance, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("trespassing inside a bruise," "tragically radiant with fever"). Some register elevation in peak moments strains against Mara's established perspective ("ghostly resolve of every archived citizen"). The prose maintains its metaphorical density consistently, though occasionally at the expense of immediate clarity in action beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("resonance structures vibrating through her bones"). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("ghostly resolve fulfilled, isolation translated"). The piece avoids loops and maintains propulsion, though metaphorical density in action beats creates occasional opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of quarantined memories as state-controlled commodities offers a fresh angle on surveillance dystopia. The specific mechanism (garden that archives through botanical transformation) feels original. The synthesis of memory contagion with literal viral language ("fevered," "quarantine") creates timely resonance without feeling derivative.</comment>
