I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through cataloging, pattern recognition, and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where buttons become witnesses to untold stories.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hourglass turner's transformation from measuring loss to "gathering beginnings" earns its arc through concrete button-cataloging that reveals counter-patterns to prophecy. Internal contradiction between duty and choice manifests in action, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: prophecy transforms from fear into "thread for anyone brave enough to sew" with visible cost in the cracked hourglass and abandoned post. The accumulative lens holds as button-cataloging builds to silence that teaches collectively, though causality occasionally relies on poetic logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber warehouse and button taxonomy create a lived-in world where setting constrains choice - the canyon echo must be uncorked in this specific space of "generations." Sensory hierarchy ("resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey") reflects POV priorities consistently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal duty (turning the hourglass) through prophetic crisis to collective possibility, with the button spiral as decisive action. Cost is legible in abandoning the monastery role, though middle pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through button-as-witness metaphor: "people keep shedding, keep fastening something new" counters prophecy's determinism. The final image of "breathing" through an open collar resonates without stating its moral about collective agency versus fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature ("every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed") maintains lyric control. Voice modulates from contemplative to urgent as pressure builds, though occasional phrases like "raw, rebuttoned possibility" strain register slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("horn toggles that once closed a sailor's coat during a typhoon"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("hourglass heart inverted") and occasional template phrasing ("She walked on") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Button-cataloging as method for unscrambling prophecy offers fresh angle on fate/agency. The synthesis of tactile archiving with mystical purpose feels specific and earned, though the canyon echo's mechanics could be more grounded.</comment>
