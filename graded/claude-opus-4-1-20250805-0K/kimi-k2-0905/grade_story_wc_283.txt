I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through pattern accretion, button cataloging, and resonant imagery rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hourglass turner's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—cataloging buttons as witnesses to lost moments—rather than exposition. Her choice to "unscramble" prophecy through material fragments shows clear internal logic, and the final decision to teach through shared silence demonstrates earned character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation of prophecy from deterministic fate to "raw, rebuttoned possibility," with clear cost in the broken hourglass and abandoned role. While the accumulative structure coheres well, the orientation anchors (who/where/when) could be slightly clearer in the opening beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and button collection function as active setting that constrains choice—each button carries specific historical weight that shapes the turner's method. Sensory detail ("resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey") serves the accumulative drive, and the final image of buttons as "constellations that had finally agreed on a story" charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from personal crisis (cracked hourglass) to collective transformation (teaching monks to hear silence). The canyon echo's transformation from raw noise to "refined possibility" demonstrates meaningful deepening, though the pressure could tighten more explicitly in middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the button motif—"people keep shedding, keep fastening something new"—without moralizing. The final image of the future as "a garment we button together, one recovered scrap at a time" offers resonant, non-literal answer to prophecy's determinism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature ("every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed"). POV control is clean throughout, though some passages edge toward elevated diction that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and information density, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("fossilized honey," "miser," "hiccupped sobs" in close proximity) and some template cadence in the middle section. The final passages achieve excellent propulsion without sacrificing clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central conceit of buttons as witnesses to human moments offers genuine freshness, transforming a mundane object into profound metaphor. The synthesis of prophecy, material culture, and shared wisdom feels organic and inevitable rather than forced, with risk-taking in the lyrical mode that heightens meaning.</comment>
