I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Mireya's technical analysis leads to her compromise solution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Mireya feeling the "faint heartbeat of magma" and concrete micro-choices under pressure. The shift from expected confrontation to collaboration with Corin shows meaningful character evolution. Minor deduction for Corin's somewhat abrupt trust shift lacking intermediate beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from problem (conflicting demands) through technical discovery (3.7mm adjustment) to earned compromise (70/30 ratio). Closure lands with visible cost as both factions accept the imperfect solution. The surveyor's chain transforms from boundary to bridge, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater constrains choices through its thermal rhythms (37-second intervals) that shape the gate calibration. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cold kiss of history," "sulfuric sigh"). The setting actively participates in the solution rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical problem to potential sabotage to collaborative solution, with Corin's detonator cord creating genuine tension. The 70/30 compromise represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses pure safety or pure renewal. Cost is visible as both sides must accept partial defeat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "encrypted compassion" emerges through action as technical precision serves human needs. The final image of regulated breath between lava and water embodies the harmony theme without stating it. Slightly weakened by the mentor's coined phrase feeling somewhat planted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive technical voice with precise diction ("spectral lines bloom like shy flowers"). Clean focalization through Mireya with no head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision and poetic observation, though occasional overwrought phrases ("dappled resolve made visible") slightly strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("cold kiss of history," "nervous confession"). The technical details integrate smoothly without exposition dumps. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph with repeated "Council arrived... Gardeners in..." structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of technical problem-solving with mythic volcano setting. The spectroscope analysis of envelope adhesive is genuinely inventive. The compromise solution avoiding binary outcomes shows originality, though the harmonizing-opposites resolution is somewhat familiar in literary fiction.</comment>
