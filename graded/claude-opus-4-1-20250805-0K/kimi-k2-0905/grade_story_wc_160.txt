I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her role as mediator-engineer. Her internal process through discovery shows concrete problem-solving rather than emotional introspection, fitting her character. The final choice to propose the cyclic solution emerges from her understanding of the founder's encrypted message, though her personal stakes beyond professional duty remain understated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the amphitheater's acoustic transformation enables harmony between opposing factions. The causal chain from adhesive analysis to copper tube to lullaby to resolution tracks cleanly. Cost is visible in the "seasons of mistrust" being overcome and the delegations being "enlarged" rather than defeated. The piece teaches its pattern of archaeological discovery early and pays it off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The volcanic amphitheater functions as more than backdrop—its acoustics become the mechanism for resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("moonlight that dappled resolve," "grinding whisper"). The setting actively constrains and enables Mireya's solution through its hidden architectural properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake: harmonizing the conflicting water needs without bloodshed. Escalation occurs through Mireya's methodical discovery process, though tension could intensify more sharply when the delegations arrive. The resolution is earned through her ingenuity rather than force, with visible cost in the communities' transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "encrypted compassion"—not choosing sides but enabling mutual understanding. The amphitheater's acoustic transformation literalizes this theme without preaching. The final image of the river "singing the same lullaby" resonantly reweights the entire piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, architectural prose matching Mireya's engineering mindset. Strong perceptual signature in how she reads physical evidence ("crystalline lattice," "copper filings"). Some elevated diction ("dappled resolve") occasionally strains but mostly serves the piece's lyrical-technical hybrid tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some phrases edge toward purple ("dappled resolve across the basalt benches"). Minor repetition of "dappled resolve" and occasional abstract phrasing ("enlarged, not defeated"). No major loops or scaffolding, and the technical vocabulary serves character and world.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering procedural with mystical mediation. The concept of using acoustic properties to create empathy is inventive. The specific details of adhesive analysis leading to musical resolution avoid template plotting. Risk-taking in the blend of technical and lyrical pays off.</comment>
