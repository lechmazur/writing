<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—fighting the tyranny of indifference through recovered histories—with concrete embodied details like "pressed her palm to the damp boardwalk, feeling the echo of footsteps." The transformation from dismissed street artist to active rebel who triggers city-wide revelation is earned through specific choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "tyranny of indifference" that occasionally reads as label rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from receiving the key to discovering the reels to broadcasting reclaimed histories, with clear closure as Mira succeeds in releasing erased voices across the city. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (her capture) and conceptual weight (the city seeing "a new map: not of streets to control, but of voices impossible to silence"). Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the final third that compresses several key beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon setting actively shapes the story—puddle reflections reveal the map, starlight creates navigation patterns for timing drone movements, and the phone booth becomes the crucial transmission point. Vivid sensory details like "starlight ripple across the water like a secret language" and spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting constrains choices and enables the final broadcast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal discovery (finding the booth) through technical challenge (aligning the heads) to city-wide confrontation with visible cost of capture. The dominant stake—recovering erased histories against state indifference—tightens as drones close in and Mira must complete her mission knowing arrest is inevitable. The final image crystallizes the cost: "hands raised, key still in her fist" while voices flood the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of revised histories and erased voices, culminating in "Indifference is a lock; memory is the key" which reweights all prior material. The final image of "voices impossible to silence, starlight braided into copper" offers resonant non-literal answer to fighting tyranny through recovered memory. Subtext operates effectively through images like "winged phones" and the booth labeled as "art."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice mixing technical precision ("adjusted the azimuth") with poetic perception ("auric cylinder"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains against the seventeen-year-old protagonist's lexicon ("coded freedom ringing off the hook"). Voice modulates effectively with rising tension, though a few passages edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "starlight braided into copper, coded freedom ringing off the hook." However, several instances of elevated register drift ("auric lagoon," "coded freedom") and some density issues with metaphorical language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in places ("She waited... She threaded... She adjusted..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveillance dystopia with analog phone technology as resistance tool—the concept of histories broadcast backward through copper lines overwriting lived moments is original. The specific detail of magnetic reels storing edited conversations and puddle reflections revealing hidden maps shows genuine invention. Some familiar dystopian elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
