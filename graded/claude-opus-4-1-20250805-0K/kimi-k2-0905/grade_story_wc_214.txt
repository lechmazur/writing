<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The janitor's transformation from observer to participant through empathy with meteors creates genuine character arc with embodied emotion (chest opening, weeping). Internal conflict between duty and spiritual curiosity drives meaningful choices. The final renunciation (leaving without the lantern) carries visible cost, though some moments drift toward abstraction rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the janitor's departure with "reopened chest" forecloses his path with clear cost (trading lantern's glow). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through meteor visions to final crystallization. The yellow afterimages and brightening meteors serve as concrete proof of transformation's cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dome's brass instruments and rotating mechanics constrain the janitor's nightly rituals, while the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that enables connection. Sensory detail is selective (dust motes as galaxies, warm eyepiece) though occasionally drifts abstract. The station's transformation into "black water" during the vision effectively uses setting to pressure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: reflections lingering → glowing responses → meteor's embedded fleck → vision of origins → final renunciation. The dominant stake (finding meaning in overlooked work) tightens as each interaction costs more vulnerability. The meteor's question about burning/changing crystallizes the choice with clear trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the lantern's transformation from yellow to transparent physicalizes the cost of openness. "Strength in vulnerability" develops through specific actions (speaking to meteors, removing lens caps) rather than assertion. The final image of warm glass in pine needles offers resonant answer without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through cosmic-scale metaphors (dust as galaxies, chest as meteor). Some register drift occurs ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") that doesn't fully match a janitor's lexicon. Voice modulates effectively under pressure, particularly during the vision sequence, though occasional abstractions reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrases like "hush of the overlooked era" and "flourishing stillness" create occasional opacity. Some template patterns emerge ("Night after night," "Years later"). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but inconsistent concreteness prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic janitor with spiritual seeker offers fresh angle on familiar loneliness-to-connection arc. The specific detail of meteors' "secret joy in becoming brief and beautiful" transforms expected imagery. Risk-taking through lyric accumulation and the non-confrontational resolution heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
