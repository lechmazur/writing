<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The janitor's spiritual curiosity drives concrete micro-choices (speaking to meteors, touching the charcoal fleck, arranging mirrors) with embodied emotion ("soft meteor of grief," "chest open"). The transformation from isolation to connection is earned through accumulated encounters, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("strength in vulnerability"). The final choice to leave without the lantern carries visible cost—trading physical light for internal illumination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks that reweight the janitor's relationship to falling stars. The vision sequence provides the decisive deepening that transforms his understanding, leading to Resonant Reconfiguration where he arranges mirrors as "welcoming committee" and walks away transformed. Cost is felt in his weeping and the trade of lantern for "softer lamp of his reopened chest." The orientation anchors arrive late (cosmic janitor, tracking station) but serve the mysterious opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The station functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—dust motes, brass instruments, rotating dome create atmosphere while the telescope and mirrors become tools for transformation. The yellow lantern glass operates as a crucial object-setting that "hoards memories" and enables the vision. Physical details like "charcoal fleck warm as heartbeat" ground the mystical elements, though some descriptions lean abstract ("flourishing stillness").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on the janitor's grief for humanity's disconnection from wonder, signaled early through "planet that had forgotten how to look up." Pressure accumulates through nightly encounters with meteor reflections, climaxing in the vision that forces him to confront cosmic loneliness and choose vulnerability. The cost manifests in his weeping and sacrifice of the lantern—concrete prices for transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the meteor's question about being "small enough to burn" versus "brave enough to change," avoiding explicit moralizing. The recurring lantern transforms from grandmother's relic to vision-enabler to sacrificed object, each iteration deepening meaning. The final image of warm glass humming in pine needles offers resonant answer without stating thesis—vulnerability as pathway to connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphor ("dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies") and purposeful compression. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("primal elegance of shared orbit") that strains the janitor's presumed lexicon. The perceptual signature focuses on cosmic scale within mundane tasks, though occasional abstractions ("flourishing stillness") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("soft meteor of grief," "brief and beautiful") but suffers from abstract phrases that resist visualization ("flourishing stillness," "hush of the overlooked era"). Some metaphors stretch credibility (lantern glass that "hoards memories"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes, though clarity occasionally yields to lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a janitor forming spiritual connection with meteors through inherited glass offers fresh angle on isolation and wonder. The vision sequence where he experiences the meteor's entire trajectory from birth to burning transforms expected custodial narrative into cosmic communion. While "overlooked era" and some mystical elements feel convenient, the specific synthesis of mundane work and transcendent experience creates memorable effect.</comment>
