<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's obsessive cartography of silence and her final transformation of the fort into navigable text demonstrate strong internal contradiction acted in scene. Her choice to preserve rather than flee carries visible cost—the erasure of names and physical reality. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "endless night" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the oracle transforms the physical fort into a navigable booklet-map, with clear cost (soldiers' names erased, world replaced). The accumulative lens holds as she catalogs silences until reality itself transposes. Slight opacity around the mechanics of world-to-page transformation prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort becomes both setting and transformed object, constraining the oracle's final choice between preservation and dissolution. Vivid sensory work ("ambered hush like breathing inside fossilized honey") and the fort's literal transformation into paper charges the closure perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating silences that literally consume physical space ("stones pulling inward"), forcing the oracle's choice between completing her map or preserving reality. Cost is visible in the erasure of names and world. The single meaningful deepening satisfies this length though more intermediate resistance would strengthen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the paradox of preserving absence—making silence navigable for future wanderers. The final image of "a constellation of hushes that answered when called" offers a non-literal answer to loss without moralizing. The recurring gold-leaf flaking constrains choices and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("coastlines of an endless night whose tides were minutes"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative design, teaching its pattern early. Minor instances of elevated diction ("transpose itself") slightly exceed the oracle's established register but don't harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in the cataloging of silences. Some abstract phrasing ("endless night whose citizens were absences") and occasional register elevation ("geography she drew") create minor friction. The prose serves the lyric design but could be more consistently grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence as navigable geography is genuinely original, transforming the familiar oracle-figure through specific world-logic. The risk of collapsing physical reality into text heightens stakes throughout. The synthesis of loss, preservation, and navigation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
