<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's obsessive drive to "cartograph oblivion" manifests through concrete micro-choices (gripping stone, pressing booklet, drawing symbols) that compound toward her final transformation into "the first coordinate." Her internal contradiction between preserving and dissolving is embodied through physical details like "bare toes gripping" while she simultaneously surrenders to fossilization. The earned cost is visible as she trades "motion for stillness one last time" before stepping "into her own outline."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens established early through "ambered hush" and symbol-making that builds density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the oracle becomes "the first coordinate on the map of an endless night." The cost is legible as she dissolves into her own creation—"stone becoming suggestion, suggestion becoming rumor"—with the fort itself paying the price of dissolution. Who/where/when anchored immediately (oracle, ridge fort, last star guttering), and the pattern of silence-into-symbol taught early pays off when she literally enters her map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed fort functions as both setting and constraint, its "salt-slick stone" and "crenels" creating physical danger while its abandoned history ("soldiers had fled") establishes atmospheric pressure. The environment actively participates through "stones answered, groaning" and the ridge's "slow exhalation," culminating in the fort's dissolution that mirrors the oracle's transformation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (taste of iron, mineral patience, ambered hush thickening like wax), with the final star serving as both timekeeper and participant in the mapping process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of completing the map before cosmic darkness is signaled early and tightens through the star's dimming ("pupil contracting against the inevitable"). Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as "the booklet itself began to feel heavier than the ridge" and time pressure intensifies ("writing faster, mildly obsessed with finishing before the star expired"). The cost manifests physically as she trades motion for stillness and ultimately dissolves into her creation, though the middle section could show more distinct pressure points between setup and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving absence—"summarizing silence into ink that would not dry"—without explicit moralizing. The recurring image of mapping/cartography shifts from external documentation to internal dissolution, with the oracle becoming what she sought to chart. The final transformation offers a non-literal answer to the question of how endings persist: through willing incorporation into the very absence being documented, creating "a still point around which absence could finally orbit without longing."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature evident in phrases like "pebbles that looked like eyes" and "echoes bruise when stared at," maintaining lyric compression without sacrificing clarity. The oracle's voice modulates from controlled observation to urgency ("wrote faster") while preserving its mystical register through "coordinates to the darkness" and "doorless doorway." No dialogue needed or attempted; the internal focalization remains stable with purposeful elision (the delayed footsteps) that pays off thematically rather than causally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with "ambered hush" and "liquid obsidian" that serves the mystical tone, though density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("marbled hush of something listening back"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "Years ago, soldiers had fled..." which establishes history, atmosphere, and motivation simultaneously. Some template cadence in middle section ("She had once been...now she collected") and filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she noted," "knowing") that dulls immediacy in pressure beats, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and cosmic dissolution avoids stock apocalypse tropes through specific details like "flaking gold-leaf booklet" and "pebbles that looked like eyes." The concept of mapping silence and becoming one's own map offers genuine originality, though the mystical oracle figure itself is somewhat familiar. Risk-taking evident in the lyric compression and abstract closure that commits fully to dissolution rather than conventional resolution, with the final image of "absence could finally orbit without longing" providing unexpected emotional specificity.</comment>
