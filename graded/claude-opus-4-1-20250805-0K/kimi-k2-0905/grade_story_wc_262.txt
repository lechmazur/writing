<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal loss, driving her to seek the lost lyrics through psychometry. Her internal conflict between hope and uncertainty manifests through embodied details like "fingertips tingled" and the physical act of scratching new lyrics onto film. The transformation from passive seeker to active projector of love is earned through accumulated discoveries, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through film imagery, projection metaphors, and the recurring motif of "unused love." Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers love is "never unused, only stored" and becomes a projector herself, with visible cost in the "envelope ashes" and emotional release. The orientation anchors clearly (projection booth, Mara, abandoned theater) and causality holds as each discovery builds toward the final revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth and abandoned theater function as more than setting—they constrain Mara's search and provide the tools (projector, film strip) essential to resolution. Sensory details like "dust floated like slow film frames" and "hushed thunder outside" create atmosphere while the spatial choreography from booth to auditorium to balcony tracks cleanly. The vintage palace's transformation from "attic of abandonment" to "vault ready" charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding mother's lost message—intensifies through accumulating discoveries: vision in crystal sphere, film moving independently, mother's voice emerging, cigarette case revelation. Each discovery narrows Mara's understanding until she must accept that love requires projection rather than possession. The cost manifests in breaking the seal (irreversible action) and accepting her mother's absence while gaining the ability to project stored love.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of film projection as memory/love storage, avoiding abstract moralizing until the mother's note provides earned wisdom. The concept of "unused love" develops through specific images—sealed letters, orphaned film, empty seats—that accumulate meaning. The final transformation of Mara into a projector of love resonates without stating an explicit moral, though the mother's postscript comes close to over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive perceptual signatures like "crystal gazer" perspective and film-specific vocabulary. The prose modulates effectively between contemplative observation and active discovery, though occasional phrases like "spatially imaginative mind" feel forced. POV remains stable in close third, with controlled psychic distance that pulls closer during revelations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the discovery sequence. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("incubate the leftover feelings," "emulsion still breathed sentiment") and some metaphors stretch too far ("pigeons that fluttered like white sprocket holes"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of psychometry in an abandoned theater offers a fresh angle on grief and inherited love, with specific details like "wax that smelled of nitrate film" creating originality. The synthesis of projection technology with emotional inheritance feels organic rather than forced. The transformation of Mara from seeker to projector provides an earned twist, though the concept of "stored love" waiting in dark rooms edges toward the sentimental.</comment>
