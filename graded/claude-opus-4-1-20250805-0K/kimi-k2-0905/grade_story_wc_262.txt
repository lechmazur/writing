I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and memory until the final revelation reweights all prior material.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to find her mother's lost message drives consistent, embodied choices (pressing palms to reels, performing psychometry, scratching new lyrics). The internal contradiction between needing closure and fearing what she'll find manifests physically when "tears blurred the ink, but she sang the tune perfectly." Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("love unused is not gone; it loops") that briefly abstracts the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through discovered objects toward Mara finding her mother's completed letter with "Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara becomes a carrier of "stored love" herself, with clear emotional cost ("tears blurred the ink"). Who/where/when anchored early; lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth and abandoned palace function as more than backdrop—the space constrains and enables action (ancient projector still works, cigarette case hidden in balcony). Vivid sensory detail: "dust floated like slow film frames," "hushed thunder outside—storm without rain." The setting's decay mirrors the preserved-but-unused love, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding mother's lost message/understanding unused love) accumulates pressure through discoveries: vision of mother as the girl, film moving itself, finding the cigarette case. The cost becomes legible when Mara must "break the seal" and accept her role as love's projector. One meaningful deepening when the blank letter transforms to reveal the complete message.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete objects (film strips, sealed letters, projection) rather than abstraction. The final revelation that "Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it" reweights all prior imagery. The recurring motif of projection/storage/release constrains choices and charges the closure when Mara herself becomes the projector.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Mara's perceptual signature shows in how she sees everything through projection metaphors ("overlaid the present gloom with remembered brightness"). Some filter-verb clustering ("felt the incubated love," "felt along the velvet") and occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match the intimate tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("pigeons that fluttered like white sprocket holes"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "love unused is not gone; it loops" followed by similar restatements. Template cadence in middle section ("She climbed... She walked... She felt..."). Mixed metaphor when film strip "threads into Mara's chest" strains physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of projection/psychometry with emotional inheritance creates an original angle on the lost-parent story. The specific detail of love being "stored" in abandoned places until someone can project it transforms familiar grief narrative. Risk-taking in the magical realist elements (self-threading film, glowing fingertips) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
