<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation to "fill the empty spaces" in his "cracked chase" heart drives clear, escalating choices through stealing the whisper, operating the press, and ultimately walking the cloud-sea. His internal contradiction between preserving and rupturing systems plays out through embodied action (trembling fingers, ink-soaked skin). The final transformation from system-keeper to rupture-walker is earned through prior causality with visible cost—the library's dissolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through glass fruit cracking into "ticking numerals," the library folding into a "sigil," and Corwin inhaling the spiral pattern. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Corwin walks the cloud-sea with "pockets full of type slugs," having compressed eternity into negotiable reality—cost visible in the library's destruction and transformation. The orientation anchors (floating library, Corwin as operator, post-Shift world) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library constrains choices throughout—Corwin must read frost patterns at dawn, the letterpress grows "like a steel orchid at the library's heart," and the breaking panes enable his final escape onto clouds. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (chiming crystal fruit, oily pollen, rustling pages). The setting's transformation from ordered system to ruptured sigil charges the final image of frost writing Corwin's name.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rupturing perfect systems escalates from stealing the whisper, to printing the forbidden sentence, to the library's complete destabilization. The tightening occurs when "eternity compressed into the moment his pulse skipped"—narrowing all possibility into a single heartbeat. Cost is legible in the library's dissolution and the mirror-keeper fragmenting into "shards reflecting every reader."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges through concrete particulars: the bottled whisper becomes "future alphabets," the library compresses to a "glyph," perfect systems rupture into "negotiable" reality. The final image of frost writing Corwin's name on untouched windowpanes offers a non-literal answer about how rupture seeds new creation. Subtext operates through the contradiction between preservation (library) and transformation (letterpress).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through printing metaphors—hearts as "cracked chase," frost as "syllables of the world's true grammar," the orrery warping into "a question mark." Voice maintains lyric compression without sacrificing clarity, and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the rupture sequence. The prose rhythm accelerates through shorter fragments as reality destabilizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"glass apples cracked, revealing seeds of ticking numerals" combines setting transformation, time motif, and thematic rupture. Some elevated diction ("armillary," "vellum") fits the archival setting. Minor register elevation in "negotiable sky" and "perfect system" but these serve the conceptual frame. Strong propulsion through the rupture sequence with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printing/typography with reality-manipulation creates non-obvious connections—whispers lodging "between em and en spaces," type slugs as seconds, sentences that "bite" paper. The concept of reality becoming "negotiable" after a "Shift" transforms familiar apocalyptic tropes. The letterpress as "steel orchid" with "gears petals" offers memorable specificity that couldn't be swapped without breaking the story's logic.</comment>
