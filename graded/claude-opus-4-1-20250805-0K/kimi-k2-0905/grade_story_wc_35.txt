<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's gift creates genuine internal conflict as she experiences others' memories viscerally, with embodied reactions like "knees buckled" under ancient grief. The transformation from taking memories to giving them shows earned change through concrete action. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("emotionally contagious") and the final paragraph's slight drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Marisol's gift transforms from curse to conduit, with visible cost in her subsumption by oceanic memories. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memories. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The reversal of her gift and the fortress's transformation provide meaningful closure with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coral pavilion's bioluminescent memories constrain Marisol's choices and charge the final transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("bitter almonds," "copper pennies"). The desert-as-former-sea creates a lived-in world where environment shapes action. Setting evolution from cold blue to warm amber mirrors the internal change perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief) signals early and deepens through Marisol's physical subsumption by memories. The reversal where she gives rather than takes memories creates meaningful escalation. Cost is visible in her being overwhelmed, though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery of memories as taste and touch, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of grief becoming "something that could shelter life" resonates without stating a moral. Minor deduction for the last paragraph's slight drift toward abstraction about recipes and balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through taste-based sensory processing maintains throughout. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to overwhelmed during the pavilion sequence. The architectural metaphors ("throat," "polyp mouths") fit the POV's sensory gift. Slight repetition in descriptive patterns prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly enhances rather than obscures ("fortress still wept," "coral's memories were emotionally contagious"). Information density high with multi-purpose sentences. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She'd learned...She'd come...She found") and minor paraphrase loops reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic gift of tasting memories through touch offers fresh perspective on familiar grief-processing themes. The coral pavilion as ancient memory repository shows originality. However, the resolution follows expected patterns of transformation through acceptance, preventing exceptional score.</comment>
