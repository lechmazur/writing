I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the layered memory work and density shifts that build toward the transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's gift creates compelling internal contradiction—taking in others' pain while learning to release it. The transformation from absorbing to giving memories is earned through concrete sensory work. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("emotionally contagious") without full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol's gift reverses and transforms the fortress's stored grief. Cost is visible in her being "subsumed completely" and the century-long wait for bloom. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for slight causality softness in how exactly pressing palms triggers the reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active constraint—the coral pavilion's memories literally overwhelm Marisol, forcing her transformation. The tidal pool patterns that shift from holding sorrow to enabling growth exemplify setting-as-character. Vivid sensory work throughout ("bitter almonds," "copper pennies").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure as memories layer from human to oceanic to geological time scales. The cost of being "subsumed" is clear, though the reversal moment could use sharper causal mechanics. Stakes deepen effectively from personal curse to land's grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete transformation of grief into "something that could shelter life instead of crushing it." The final insight about balancing rather than forgetting bitter notes resonates without moralizing. Strong integration with the cooking metaphor throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("each droplet carrying the salt of a hundred forgotten storms"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on taste/texture. Some elevated diction ("subsume," "bioluminescent") occasionally strains but mostly serves the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("turning grief into something that could hold life again"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("sturdy brittle song") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("emotionally contagious through touch"). Information density is high but sometimes tips into purple territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic gift of tasting memories through touch offers fresh angle on familiar healing narrative. The reversal from taking to giving memories feels earned rather than convenient. Specific details like "bitter almonds from the poisoned governor" elevate beyond generic grief-processing.</comment>
