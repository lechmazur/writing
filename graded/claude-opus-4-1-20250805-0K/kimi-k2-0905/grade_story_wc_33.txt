<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to expose broken promises through "linking absences" drives consistent, escalating choices from planting the virus to releasing the thunderstorm as diversion. Internal complexity emerges through the respectful rebellion paradox and solidarity with Sal. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "where broken promises heal" formulation that doesn't fully embody in concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from mail delivery through virus deployment to escape, with the thunderstorm serving as calculated diversion. The closure achieves Charged Poise—the virus beginning its work while the protagonist continues the cycle "because emptiness itself can be a message." Cost is visible through the arcade's solidarity blackout and the protagonist's acceptance of perpetual disputed status.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade's sensory texture (hot solder, colder regrets, neon saints) creates atmospheric pressure while specific details like the Sky Empress pinball machine constrain tactical choices. The thunderstorm's violet glass matching the twilight sky charges the final escape sequence. Setting actively shapes the protagonist's infiltration route and escape timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk through the thunderstorm release to the collective arcade shutdown, with the virus deployment as the decisive irreversible act. The border drones' algorithmic suspicion creates genuine pressure that forces the protagonist's timing. Cost manifests through Sal's complicity and the arcade's sacrificial darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blue heron motif elegantly bridges hope and absence, from chalk drawing to data-virus feather, reweighting the water promises theme. "Emptiness itself can be a message" crystallizes the thematic argument without moralizing. The neon saints crying for waterless villages creates resonant imagery that avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice fuses noir sensibility with speculative elements ("disputed territory mailman," "cumulonimbus claws"). Perceptual signature remains consistent through stress, tracking minute details like the arcade's "brittle hush" breaking into "anxious confetti." No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsive rhythm with varied sentence lengths matching scene tension. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story layers simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("bruised violet," "borrowed rain") though it serves atmospheric coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cyberpunk surveillance state with intimate acts of data resistance feels fresh and specific. "Linking absences" as viral warfare mechanism transforms expected smuggling tropes. The arcade setting as solidarity network rather than mere backdrop shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
