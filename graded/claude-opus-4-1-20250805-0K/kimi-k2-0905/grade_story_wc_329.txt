I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard transforms and Calla dissolves into myth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calla's motivation is clear and embodied through musical action, with her heartbeat conducting the transformation showing excellent integration of internal and external. The "gap between knowing and understanding" creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final dissolution into rumor, though it works as Earned Stasis with visible cost (her physical form).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the orchard transforms from mechanical to organic, with Calla's dissolution as clear cost. The accumulative structure builds through musical layers and reversals (backward lullaby, upward blossoms) that reweight the opening tension. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern teaches its lyric logic early through the locust shell's transformative properties.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard functions as active constraint, with glass bridge, bronze guardians, and singing trees all shaping Calla's tactics. The locust shell as micro-setting that transforms into instructions directly enables the resolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the final transformation where "statues rooted themselves as ordinary trees" perfectly charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are immediately clear: extracting beauty before calcification. The musical reversal that makes "statues' eyelids drooped, eyelids that had never been designed to close" provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Calla's dissolution and the orchard's permanent transformation, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once the musical pattern is discovered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between mechanical order and organic beauty, with the locust shell's molting serving as perfect metaphor for transformation. The ending's "heartbeat of a world learning to break free again" resonates without moralizing. The child finding the seed extends the theme beyond the immediate story, suggesting cycles of liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "violinist who had vanished into the gap between knowing and understanding." Perceptual signature strong in musical/sensory details like "bow already tasting the dusk air." The prose modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, particularly in the transformation sequence where reality bends to music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "bronze guardians with gears for joints" establishes both threat and theme. Some figurative density in places ("tarnished wonder, as if childhood fairy tales had been left out in the rain to rust") but it serves the lyric mode. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the musical sequence and breathing in contemplative moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical magic and mechanical dystopia creates memorable world. The reversed lullaby causing gravity to invert shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation of Calla into "rumor carried by apricot scent" offers non-obvious resolution that feels earned through the established pattern of dissolution and reformation.</comment>
