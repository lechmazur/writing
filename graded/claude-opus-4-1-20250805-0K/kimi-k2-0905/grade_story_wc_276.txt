I'll evaluate this story systematically under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through lyric density and pattern rather than causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's cool-headedness manifests through embodied choices—driving the spike, voicing silence into metal—with internal consistency. The contradiction between hunting divinity and maintaining composure creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the precise weight of an answered question") in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara understands "divinity is not a catch but a conversation," with visible cost in the goddess's dissolution and the garden's transformation. The accumulative structure coheres through sound/silence patterns. Slight opacity in the middle goddess encounter prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting—chords bloom from footsteps, vines recoil from calm, the spike creates a "thirsty artery." Environment directly constrains Mara's tactics through sonic pressure. The tideline and constellation details charge the ending's forgiveness chord.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from hunting an echo to confronting the star-goddess's ultimatum ("burn the garden silent"). The rail spike's deployment creates meaningful tightening as all vibrations converge. Cost manifests in the goddess's dissolution and Mara's acceptance of conversation over capture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hunting/conversation duality without explicit statement. The final image of "forgiveness played backward through a conch" resonantly reweights the pursuit narrative. The spike as "tongue that learned a new language" deepens the communication theme organically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric consistency—"sleepwalkers tangled in their own glittering nets," "feral lullabies." Perceptual signature stays rooted in Mara's fisher sensibility. Some density in the goddess encounter slightly obscures immediate clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful density, though occasionally tips toward overwriting ("emotional colors draining like sunset"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. Minor repetition of "feral lullaby" and some abstract constructions ("the precise weight of an answered question") create slight drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-hunting through voiced silence offers genuine originality. Constellations that "lumber earthward" and translate emotions as colored smoke create fresh imagery. The rail spike's transformation from industrial relic to divine conduit shows inventive repurposing.</comment>
