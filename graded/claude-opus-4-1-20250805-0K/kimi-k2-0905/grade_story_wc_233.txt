<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear and intensifies through concrete embodied details like "silk slippers soaked with dew" and "each breath a stitch sewing her closer," though some moments slip into abstract summary ("driven by the need to unravel"). The crucial realization that she's caught in a time loop creates genuine internal conflict, and her final choice carries visible cost as she accepts erasure to save the kingdom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen accepts becoming the voice that warns her past self. The closure lands with clear cost ("coronation and erasure"), though the time-loop mechanics strain credibility slightly. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and maintains its dream-logic consistency throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto and ember stones function as more than setting—they constrain the queen's choice and enable the transformation. Sensory details like "air thinned into lace" and "frost flowered on her eyelashes" create atmospheric pressure. The grotto's paradoxical warmth/cold mirrors the story's central tension between preservation and erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing kingdom's forgetting) escalates through the queen's climb and discovery of the time loop, with meaningful tightening when she realizes staying will "burn the last of her living memory." The cost is legible in the final transformation, though the middle section could use sharper pressure points rather than discovery-based progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the paradox of memory/forgetting and the cyclical nature of sacrifice, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "bleeding starlight" as escaping memory and the crown as "both coronation and erasure" create resonant images. The ending reweights the opening without stating its meaning, letting the fireflies' "silent applause" suggest acceptance of necessary sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive phrases like "lacy menace" and "shared exhale," though occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("speared her sleep"). POV control is stable throughout, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately with the queen's emotional state, particularly in the grotto scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("bleeding starlight that seeped from the sky like a wound"), it suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff (-0.5). Several instances of paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the dream/memory concept (-0.4). The phrase "ember grotto on the ridge" repeats awkwardly, and some metaphors strain clarity ("air thinned into lace, a lacy menace").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The time-loop structure and bleeding starlight as physical memory offer fresh angles on familiar sacrifice narratives. The specific synthesis of dream-prophecy-memory creates an original temporal paradox. However, the core "queen sacrifices self for kingdom" premise remains somewhat conventional despite the inventive execution.</comment>
