I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between protecting her sanctuary and accepting the seed's transformative demand creates genuine tension. The shift from controller to co-creator with the building shows earned change through concrete action. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("notably receptive") and the slightly convenient self-written note device.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the building transforms into a living puzzle-maker with visible cost (Mira's control surrendered). The accumulative lens holds as patterns (seed, growth, transformation) build toward the final image of the haven writing its own riddles. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, though the time-loop element strains plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The escape room's architecture becomes an active constraint—false doors, mirror mazes, and glass floors all participate in the transformation. The reversed brook and spiral doorways embody the spatial mutation. The corpse flower's roots threading "between floorboards, seeking orthogonal angles" makes setting inseparable from plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: seed arrival → planting urgency → architectural transformation → guests as pollinators. The cost manifests as Mira surrendering design control to become "puzzle and planter alike." One meaningful deepening occurs when the building begins breathing with guests, though agency sometimes feels reactive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of innovation requiring surrender of control—Mira must let the labyrinth rewrite itself to truly safeguard creativity. The corpse flower blooming "not rot but...phosphorescent seeds" inverts decay/growth expectations. The final image of empty envelopes reveals the recursive nature of creative spaces.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with phrases like "storm-born silence" and "orthogonal approaches to revelation." POV control stays clean in single focalization. Some register elevation ("vegetal pulse," "pollinators") fits the fantastical tone though occasionally strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density serves the accumulative mode but occasionally tips into overwriting—"storm-born silence settle over the village like damp wool" works, but stacked metaphors accumulate. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive use of "storm-born silence" (3x) and "notably receptive" (2x).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The corpse flower as architectural virus transforming an escape room into a living puzzle-generator offers genuine freshness. The time-loop element (note from future self) adds conceptual intrigue. Risk-taking in the surreal transformation pays off as guests become unwitting "pollinators" spreading puzzle seeds.</comment>
