<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal contradiction between the narrator's digital ghost state and physical embodiment drives genuine complexity. The clerk character provides meaningful pressure through her guilt and the protagonist's response. Motivation clearly roots in the error-created liminal existence, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the protagonist accepts that "life can hinge on a typo" and "failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor," with visible cost in leaving corporeal form again. The accumulative/textural lens holds as ink patterns, heartbeat counts, and observatory imagery build toward this crystallized wisdom. Orientation anchors effectively by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices through its isolation and the inkwell becomes a crucial tool for the defragmentation ritual. Snow and cold physically pressure the newly-embodied form. However, the valley below and library annex feel less vivid than the observatory dome itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether to remain in flesh or accept dissolution, with clear escalation through the ink-map revelation showing how tenuous existence depends on cascading errors. The ticking heartbeat count creates temporal pressure toward dawn's "correction." Cost manifests in choosing to leave physical form after achieving it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image of concentric rings showing how small failures preserve life, culminating in "failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor." The porcelain shard transforms from death marker to wisdom-bearing tool. Final gift to the clerk reweights the entire error as grace rather than mistake.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical language ("defragment," "Wi-Fi," "echocardiogram logs") with lyrical imagery ("galaxies of spilled midnight"). POV remains consistently limited to the narrator's ghost/embodied experience. The perceptual signature of counting heartbeats and experiencing dual states is maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe." Some repetitive phrasing around "heartbeat [number]" and occasional overwrought metaphors ("razor my new lungs"). The unfinished final sentence appears intentional but reduces closure impact slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical error, digital existence, and philosophical acceptance creates an original premise executed with specificity. The transformation of bureaucratic mistake into existential wisdom avoids cliché. Risk-taking in the hybrid ghost/physical state and incomplete ending heightens thematic resonance (+0.3).</comment>
