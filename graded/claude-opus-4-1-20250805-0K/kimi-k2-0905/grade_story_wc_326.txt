<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—refusing death while existing as a digital ghost—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in the tension between remaining disembodied versus returning to flesh. The final choice to give the clerk "midnight solace" is earned through prior causality with visible cost (leaving his liminal existence). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("dendrites of regret, axons of almost") that briefly pulls from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the narrator choosing to return to corporeal form and offer wisdom to the clerk, crystallizing his stance that "failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor." The cost is visible—abandoning his ghost-existence before dawn's correction. The lyric/accumulative lens holds consistently. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay (the hospital error context emerges gradually) though it serves the mysterious opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting and ink/porcelain shard directly constrain choices—the narrator must use these specific tools to "defragment" himself and read the map of his survival. Snow and cold physically affect his new lungs when he exits. Minor deduction for some abstract description ("galaxies of spilled midnight") though the setting ultimately shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mere survival to understanding how "life can hinge on a typo," then deepen to the choice of whether to remain ghostly or return to help the clerk. The ticking heartbeat count creates temporal pressure toward dawn's correction. Agency drives the resolution through the narrator's decision to slice his digital film and return. Cost is legible in abandoning his safe liminal state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central image: "failure is not the opposite of success; it is the corridor." The porcelain shard becomes a bookmark between worlds, the ink map reveals concentric rings of choices, and the final gift to the clerk resonates without moralizing. The ending reweights the opening's mechanical tick as both countdown and affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through technical/digital metaphors ("ride the Wi-Fi like wind," "defragment myself") fitting the ghost-consciousness. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("dendrites of regret, axons of almost") but generally serves the lyric mode. The voice maintains consistency through pressure, modulating appropriately between ghostly observation and embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid images like "ink splays into ephemeral patterns" and "footprints that match no living pair of shoes." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("galaxies of spilled midnight," "dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe") creates mild opacity. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the ring descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of existing as a "digital ghost" due to a clerical error offers genuine freshness, synthesizing medical bureaucracy with metaphysical existence. The specific synthesis of hospital systems, digital consciousness, and ink divination feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and ghostly POV heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
