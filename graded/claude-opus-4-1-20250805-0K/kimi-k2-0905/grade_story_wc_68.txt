<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Caldera's motivation—rejecting official narratives to preserve truth through physical archaeology—drives consistent choices from sewer diving to bone-stylus carving. Her "rationally rebellious" nature manifests through concrete actions (refusing vaccines, mapping tunnels, creating counter-narratives) with visible cost. The final public declaration crystallizes her stance but lacks the immediate dramatic consequence that would push into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sedimentary layers of denial literally and metaphorically build toward Caldera's counter-narrative intervention. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she surfaces to speak publicly, shifting from hidden archivist to visible truth-teller with the crowd's "hesitation" marking changed stakes. Cost appears in her isolation and the physical labor of truth-preservation, though the immediate price of her public stance remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drowned city functions as both setting and metaphor, with physical layers (sewer conduits, burial sumps, sunken districts) constraining Caldera's archaeological method and enabling her counter-narrative. Sensory specificity ("soot-black fingers," "slime-slick stair," "black water") grounds the abstract theme while spatial choreography from depths to surface structures the narrative arc. The seafarer's cog becomes micro-setting when jammed into femur as stylus, directly enabling the climactic act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether truth can survive institutional denial—escalates from private observation (cog meditation) through active archaeology (diving, mapping) to public confrontation. Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, with each discovered layer deepening Caldera's commitment. The closure choice to speak publicly after plague-long silence marks genuine escalation, though the immediate consequence remains suspended in the crowd's "hesitation."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of sedimentary layers representing both physical archaeology and accumulating lies, with the sewer's "slow filtration" method opposing surface propaganda. The final declaration—"Time is a gear that eats its own teeth"—reweights the chronometer cog as symbol of self-consuming narratives without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates through physical details (census parchment bleeding "faces into numbers") that embody abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent philosophical density with distinctive diction ("drowned bones," "sedimentary layers," "abrasive calm") that reflects Caldera's analytical nature. POV control holds steady through close third person with appropriate access to her perceptions and reasoning. The prose occasionally tilts toward over-decoration ("marble domes jut from the tide like broken teeth") but serves the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density serves the accumulative design with most sentences carrying multiple functions—the cog is timepiece, archaeological tool, and thematic symbol. Some figurative excess appears ("broken teeth," "ghost heartbeat") but remains controlled. Minor loops occur with "sedimentary layers" and variants of "competing narratives" appearing frequently, though this repetition partially serves the textural accumulation strategy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of archaeological truth-telling through literal descent into city strata offers fresh angle on post-plague denial narratives. Specific invention—using a chronometer cog jammed in femur as stylus—demonstrates imaginative problem-solving grounded in available materials. The fusion of physical excavation with narrative archaeology avoids abstraction through concrete detail.</comment>
