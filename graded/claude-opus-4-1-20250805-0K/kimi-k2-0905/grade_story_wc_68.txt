<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Caldera's "rationally rebellious" nature drives concrete choices throughout—refusing vaccine lines, diving through sunken districts, creating the counter-narrative. Her internal contradiction between preserving truth and embracing sewage-tasting immunity methods creates genuine complexity. The final public declaration crystallizes her values with visible cost (breaking years of silence). Minor deduction for some abstract philosophizing that doesn't fully embody in gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with sedimentary layering pattern taught early and sustained through diving sequences, pottery shards aging with depth, and laminated corpse rows. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Caldera surfaces to speak her first public words, crystallizing her counter-narrative stance with felt cost (years of silence broken). The "sedimentary layers inside her own mind shift" creates legitimate RR. Slight weakness in mid-section pacing where historical ledger descriptions extend without immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drowned city setting constrains every choice—from navigating flooded tunnels to reading water-worn ledgers to finding the burial sump. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sewer conduit that still smelled of the plague years"). The environment literally becomes Caldera's method as "descent equaled time." Setting charges the final image as she surfaces "beneath a half-collapsed belfry where sunrise painted the abrasive calm."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of truth-preservation versus denial escalates through discovery of competing ledgers, mapping tunnels as counter-chronicle, finding the burial sump's "silent agreement," to final public declaration. The cog's "two futures" reflection effectively crystallizes options. Cost is visible in years of isolation and the crowd's recoil. Escalation could be sharper—the middle sections accumulate evidence without significantly raising stakes until the sump discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sedimentary metaphor: truth settling through layers of denial, competing narratives as "ballast, weighting the city to a preferred past." The chronometer cog as "gear that eats its own teeth" resonates without stating a moral. Final image of Caldera's mind forming "a stratum harder than denial" reweights the entire accumulation. Slight deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing ("Time is a gear...") that approaches direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction matching Caldera's philosopher identity ("abrasive calm," "sedimentary layers," "laminated rows"). Perceptual signature strong—she reads the world through geological/mechanical metaphors consistently. Syntax modulates effectively between contemplative passages and action sequences. Minor register drift in peak moments ("fossil of shame") but maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the city's survivors rewrote street names nightly, painting fresh lies over older lies" establishes setting, conflict, and theme simultaneously. Strong varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("sedimentary layer of denial would press the ruins into a fossil of shame") but doesn't obscure meaning. Clear propulsion through diving sequence to emergence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plague narrative, archaeological methodology, and philosophical rebellion creates non-obvious angle. The concept of reading city strata like geological time while authority rewrites surface history is genuinely inventive. Caldera's sewage-immunity method and bone-stylus counter-narrative show committed risk-taking. The "chronometer judged by how loyally they disagreed with the shore" transforms maritime navigation into epistemological metaphor.</comment>
