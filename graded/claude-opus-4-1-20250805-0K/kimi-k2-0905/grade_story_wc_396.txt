I'll evaluate this story under the Causal drive lens, as the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages leading to Kael's rescue of Sira, with a Decisive Change closure where he acts on his motivation to "map empathy onto action."

<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation crystallizes beautifully ("to map empathy onto action meant to treat another's peril as a coordinate on his own skin"), with contradictory impulses shown through the fragment's dual futures. The rescue sequence demonstrates micro-choices under pressure with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from fragment's vision to rescue execution, with clear DC closure (Sira saved, relationship restored). The shard showing two futures effectively raises stakes. Deduction for slightly rushed final beat that cuts off mid-whisper without fully landing the cost, though the rescue's physical toll and relationship reconfiguration are evident.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard setting actively constrains choices (iron ladder, cliff face, ice floes closing) and provides resources (mirrors, pruning hook) that enable the rescue. Vivid sensory detail throughout. The setting doesn't quite reach 9+ as the orchard's swaying and mirror arrangement, while atmospheric, don't directly shape the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from seeing Sira in danger to the ice threatening to crush her, with meaningful tightening when "the weighted breath before reply tighten[s] into a noose of seconds." The two-futures vision effectively forecloses options. Cost is visible in physical toll and risk, though emotional cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action as Kael literally maps empathy onto physical rescue, transforming abstract principle into embodied risk. The mirrors reflecting "memories...at the exact angle of regret" subtly reinforces themes of perspective and action. Final image of shadow-threads drinking Sira's silhouette resonates but feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with rich, specific diction ("shadow-laced threads that drank moonlight," "weighted breath before reply"). POV control is excellent with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is strong (measuring silence like foghorns). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds Kael's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language that serves the fantastical setting. Strong sentence variety and rhythm control. Some moments of elevated diction ("chromatic scale," "reconstitute possibility from refusal") occasionally strain naturalism but don't obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper and peacekeeper roles, with original world-building (empathy-mapping cartographer, Council's destroyed scrying sphere). The mirror-spear improvisation shows genuine ingenuity. Specific details throughout avoid generic fantasy tropes, though some elements feel slightly familiar.</comment>
