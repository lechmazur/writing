I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and scientific detail toward a resonant final moment of witness and extinction.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like touching her grandmother's tooth-marked camera and the cracking voice on "intervention." Her purposeful curiosity manifests in concrete micro-choices: grinding the sand grain, timing the chemical reactions, waiting past the first blush to capture the final possible second. Internal contradiction operates effectively between professional documentation ("Species Anemone selenensis, final observation") and personal grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the inspector's act of witness—her three photographs become "the only color left of them," with visible cost in the permanent fossilization and her expiring contract at sunrise. The accumulative structure coheres as scientific observation transforms into mourning, with the chemical timer providing causal linkage to the anemones' precise blooming window. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2 (crater inspector, Mount Selene summit, earthrise).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lunar environment constrains every choice: the vitrified regolith, terminator wind, and seven-year blooming cycle create the story's temporal urgency. The micro-setting of the sand grain's chemical reaction serves as both timer and metaphor, while Earth's blue glow "painted everything in dawnlit melancholy" charges the final image. Details like "trickling endlessly in lunar gravity" and "electrostatic whispers" ground the otherworldly setting in sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the tightening temporal window—from 43 minutes to the first blush to the final shutter clicks as anemones fold "with soft crystalline clicks." The dominant stake (preserving the last record) faces coherent pressure through the expiring contract, the anemones' brief window, and the abandoned human infrastructure. Cost manifests in the permanent fossil imprints and the inspector's recognition that "witnessing could be a form of resistance against forgetting."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete particulars of extinction documentation without moralizing. The stolen sand grain from "days when time still felt abundant" resonates against the precise chemical timing, while "curiosity was just another form of mourning" reweights the scientific mission. The final image of "the only color left of them" offers a non-literal answer about preservation and loss without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The perceptual signature is distinctly scientific-elegiac: "translucent polyps," "vein of feldspar," "bioluminescent regret." Voice modulates effectively from technical field notes to the emotional crack on "intervention," maintaining controlled distance even in grief. The prose rhythm accelerates during the blooming sequence ("fired the shutter once, twice, three times") while preserving the inspector's measured observation throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is exceptional—nearly every line advances atmosphere, stakes, or character simultaneously. Prose achieves clarity without sacrificing texture: "The inspector felt the blush before she saw it: the buried half-grain warming through the basalt, its pink bloom seeping upward like diluted blood." No loops or scaffolding detected, with varied sentence structures maintaining momentum through the 43-minute countdown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard SF precision (chemical timers, lunar geology) with extinction elegy feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of using a stolen hourglass grain as a chemical timer is genuinely inventive, while details like "tooth-marks of her grandmother's gloves" ground the speculative elements in human specificity. Risk-taking in the incomplete final sentence ("no margin") heightens the urgency without obscuring meaning.</comment>
