<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's purposeful curiosity drives concrete micro-choices (stealing/dividing the grain, timing the chemical reactions) that reveal her values hierarchy through action. Her internal contradiction between professional duty ("contract expired at sunrise") and personal mission creates authentic tension, though the emotional arc relies slightly on declarative moments ("realized she was speaking to ghosts").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the anemones' extinction, with the chemical timer providing causal scaffolding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the final fossil imprint reweights the inspector's documentation as the "only color left," with visible cost in the permanent loss. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through the sand grain's division and maintains coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lunar environment actively constrains choices through terminator wind timing, UV bleaching threat, and the anemones' seven-year cycle. Micro-setting details like "vitrified regolith that glittered like shattered glass" and "glassy petals trembling with anticipatory phosphorescence" create specificity while the Earth's blue glow charging everything with "dawnlit melancholy" integrates atmosphere with emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of documenting extinction before permanent loss escalates through the tightening chemical timer and the anemones' irreversible folding sequence. Cost is legible in "sealing their light like letters never meant to be mailed" and the final fossil imprint, though agency remains primarily observational rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete particulars of witnessing extinction as "a form of resistance against forgetting," avoiding abstract statements. The final image of the fossil imprint as "the only color left" offers a non-literal answer about preservation versus loss, though the "curiosity as mourning" line edges toward explicit thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows through selective scientific observation ("Species Anemone selenensis, final observation") filtered through elegiac sensibility. Voice maintains consistency through specialized lexicon ("vitrified regolith," "bioluminescent regret") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the final folding sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The crater inspector climbed the moonlit summit" establishes character, action, setting, atmosphere). Some figurative excess appears ("bioluminescent regret," "diluted blood") without clear payoff, and occasional register elevation ("eulogy only they could hear") slightly strains the POV's scientific baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar ecology extinction documentation with personal mission creates a non-obvious angle on environmental loss narratives. The specific invention of lunar anemones that bloom once every seven years to "drink starlight" before fossilizing permanently offers genuine freshness, elevated by the risk of ending on quiet documentation rather than dramatic intervention.</comment>
