<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—his trembling fingers seeking unprogrammed wonder while wearing apprentice bands, his choice to pluck a single petal showing measured restraint under pressure. The "frost scars healing without drama, like mistakes quietly forgiven" delivers genuine embodied emotion. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "sacred in the simple" not fully dramatized until the marigold discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the fractured keystone and glowing petal create visible cost and transformation. The progression from observing automated miracles to discovering/protecting organic wonder lands with felt weight. Small deduction for the incomplete final sentence, though it functions as purposeful elision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marigold between icicles "shaped like wings" powerfully constrains choice and charges the ending—this micro-setting element drives Elian's transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects his priorities: "mist that smelled of wet soil after rain—impossible at this altitude." The algorithmic auroras and "brilliant dimness" create atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Elian's agency: unstrapping bands → stepping through → taking petal → keystone fracturing, with clear cost at each stage. The dominant stake (finding authentic wonder vs automated miracle) tightens when the doorway begins shrinking "driven by curfew subroutines." Slightly lower score because the middle section could use one more beat of active pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the marigold's stubborn existence and Elian's single-petal restraint—never stated, always embodied. The envelope "To Whoever Still Looks Up" and scattered light from the fractured keystone create resonant non-literal answers. "The sacred was not hidden in cathedrals of data but in one small life insisting on color" earns its insight through concrete discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices "algorithmic auroras stitch the sky with prefab wonder" and feels stone "pulse like a tired heart remembering a dream." Voice modulates effectively from wry observation to wonder. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("accommodated impossibilities") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The vapor bore him, cool but not cold, across a narrow bridge of condensed moonlight." Some figurative density in places ("brilliant dimness," "lingering luminance") creates minor opacity. The incomplete final sentence works as purposeful pattern but creates slight momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of automated miracles scheduled by algorithm against one stubborn marigold offers fresh specificity. "Love at 09:15, awe at noon, transcendence delivered by drone" transforms the familiar dystopian premise through precise ironic detail. The mist-walking method and fractured keystone as price elevate beyond template.</comment>
