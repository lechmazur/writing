<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lina's internal contradiction between crystallizing breath (harm) and releasing it (healing) drives genuine struggle through embodied sensation and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation of the broken quill earns its cost through accumulated grief-work, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("stories impatient to be read").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through ritual repetition toward Resonant Reconfiguration where breaking the quill releases both memory and method with visible cost. The twelfth-stroke timing creates genuine pressure that pays off when motes transform into readable sentences, though the brother's fall backstory slightly exceeds the 20% allowance without fully anchoring each reflection to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating rock platform constrains every choice through its railingless edge and three-inch hover, while sensory selection (tea-dark lake, moss beading, iron kettle's soundless hiss) reflects Lina's hypervigilant perception. The storm's arrival changes physical conditions that enable the final release, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming crystallized grief) tightens through the kettle's rising steam deadline that forces completion despite burning lungs. The typhoon's arrival provides external pressure that enables speaking rather than writing, though the resolution relies partially on Master Jomei's breath-push rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rune that "should open lungs but instead crystallized the air inside them" establishes the central metaphor that pays off when motes become speakable words. The broken quill as proof the story was "torn from the world rather than merely written" offers resonant closure, though "scars are merely stories impatient to be read" edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through precise sensory selection (crow-quill grain, squid-ink trembling, rain bouncing knee-high) and rhythmic control that accelerates toward the twelfth stroke. Voice maintains consistency through peak pressure, though occasional elevation ("saturated hush," "luminous sentences orbiting") slightly exceeds Lina's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the platform description establishes danger while revealing tradition), though some figurative density in peak beats ("crystallized breath shattering outward into motes") and one paraphrase loop ("scars had become stories, and stories...know how to fly" restates the transformation). Strong propulsion through varied syntax maintains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inverted rune that crystallizes rather than opens breath offers a fresh angle on grief-as-suffocation, while the floating tea ceremony platform creates unexpected ritual space. The specific synthesis of calligraphy, breath-holding, and storm-timing feels earned, though the core transformation metaphor (scars to stories) appears in various forms across contemporary literature.</comment>
