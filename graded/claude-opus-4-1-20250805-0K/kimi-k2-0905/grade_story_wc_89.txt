<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sister's transformation and the narrator's paradoxical steady resolve create genuine internal conflict, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("I felt my own skin begin to glow... but I fought the change"). The final merger is earned through accumulated choices, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where two beings merge into one guardian, with visible cost ("the last tear either of us would cry alone"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as spice-conjuring and memory-tasting build toward transformation, though a few causal links between ritual steps could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard under permanent moonlight constrains and enables the transformation ritual, with specific details like the "oldest apple tree whose roots drink from the river of forgetting" directly shaping the conjuration's location and power. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from summoning to merger as the narrator realizes "to reforge the bond beyond death, one of us had to die into the other's form"—a meaningful deepening that narrows options. Cost is visible in the irreversible transformation, though middle pressure could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The final image of the merged being watering the roots with "the last tear either of us would cry alone" resonantly answers the central question of bonds beyond death without stating a moral. Theme emerges through concrete ritual actions and the paradox of unity through dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("blood is the price of paradox"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through sensory-rich, mythic language, though occasional phrases edge toward purple prose without quite crossing over.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the ritual sequences. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("silhouette of ember and memory, crying notes that cracked the night open like a pomegranate") occasionally slows momentum without clear payoff, though clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of metamorphosis-as-merger rather than simple transformation offers a non-obvious resolution that feels inevitable in hindsight. The spice-based conjuration and the specific mythic creatures create fresh texture within familiar phoenix mythology.</comment>
