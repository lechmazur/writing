<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—needing to stay flesh while feeling her own transformation begin—create authentic tension during the conjuration. The final merger into "two voices in one chest" is earned through prior sacrifice (the branded lip, the bleeding palms) with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("reluctant metamorphosis is still metamorphosis") that briefly abstracts the embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands as the sisters merge into a guardian entity, with the cost made explicit: "to reforge the bond beyond death, one of us had to die into the other's form." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (spices, moonlight, memory) build toward transformation. Orientation anchors clearly (orchard, night, post-phoenix rising) by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard functions as active setting—its "river of forgetting" and backward-blooming flowers enable the conjuration while the permanent moonlight charges the atmosphere throughout. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (starfruit bruising feet, oils stinging palms, saffron dissolving in honey). The environment directly constrains choice when the narrator must perform the ritual beneath the specific tree.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the sister from phoenix form—escalates through the conjuration's increasing demands: blood price, physical transformation beginning, then the revelation that one must "die into the other's form." Agency drives every beat as the narrator chooses each ritual step despite mounting cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each spice and memory deepens the bond's weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of preservation through transformation—the fortune's prophecy pays off without explicit moralizing. The final image of the merged entity "keeping every promise the sky once forgot" resonantly reweights the opening's memory-clinging moonlight. Subtext operates through the spice-memory associations and the shadow-child's warning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines mythic register with visceral specificity ("my soles bruised by fallen starfruit"). The perceptual signature—linking every sensory detail to memory and relationship—remains consistent throughout. Purposeful compression and lyric elision serve the accumulative design, with the pattern taught early through the fortune-cookie structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (setting/memory/sensation in "cardamom French toast, clove oranges, the peppery broth"). Prose momentum builds through varied sentence lengths and strategic paragraph breaks. Minor figurative excess in places ("caravan of memories") but no loops or scaffolding, and the clarity at closure remains untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of metamorphosis-as-preservation and cooking-as-conjuration feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the merged-entity ending heightens rather than obscures meaning. The specific detail work (ghost pepper with star anise, three-headed hare weeping pearls) transforms potentially generic magical realism into something memorably particular.</comment>
