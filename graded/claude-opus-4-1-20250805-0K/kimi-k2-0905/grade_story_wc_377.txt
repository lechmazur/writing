<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tuner's seasonally mute condition and her communication through metal shimmer create a distinctive character with clear motivation rooted in sensory overdose. Her thirty-year dedication and the final choice to leave the instrument to the mountain shows earned renunciation with visible cost. The boy encounter demonstrates values through micro-choice, though some interior passages lean toward abstract ("frequency of human wonder").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the sculpture's activation by comet, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where wonder becomes a transmittable frequency. The piece teaches its pattern early (mute quarter, metal communication) and pays it off when silence becomes "the resonant cavity." Cost is visible in the thirty-year investment and the tuner's departure, leaving her life's work behind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bluff setting constrains every choice—from the thinned air to the sculpture's placement for comet interaction. Sensory selection reflects the tuner's priorities (micro-oscillations, metal frequencies). The iceberg fragment's physical transformation and the sculpture's kinetic response to environment directly shape the closure, making setting indispensable to the final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: years of silent work → final calibration → comet arrival → sculpture activation. The dominant stake (preserving wonder's frequency) tightens as the comet approaches, with visible cost in the tuner's mute sacrifice and final departure. Agency manifests through precise calibration choices, though the comet's role as external catalyst slightly dilutes protagonist-driven resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the sculpture's transformation of silence into "resonant cavity" for future voices, avoiding any moralizing. The concept that "wonder is not a feeling but a frequency" reweights the entire narrative without stating a lesson. The bronze wedge transfer to the boy creates thematic continuity without explanation, trusting the image to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through inventive compounds ("breath-scriptures," "micro-oscillations") and rhythm that mirrors the tuner's precision. POV control remains stable with selective perception reflecting her acoustic priorities. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("ionic glow into ribbons of unseen hues") that slightly strain the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("fist of ice older than any nation") and good information density. However, abstract phrases like "color of wonder" appear multiple times without concrete grounding, and some sentences strain with ornate construction ("electromagnetic tail would pluck the kinetic ribs like a bow across an infinite viola"). The final image lands cleanly despite these periodic density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical, astronomical, and sculptural elements creates an original meditation on preservation of wonder. The concept of a mute season for a bell tuner, and wonder as a tunable frequency, transforms familiar elements. The risk of abstraction mostly pays off through concrete detail, though "truth" and "wonder" occasionally feel unmoored from specificity.</comment>
