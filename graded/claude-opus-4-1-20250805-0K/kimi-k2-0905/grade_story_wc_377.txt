I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where the tuner's work crystallizes into a moment of cosmic alignment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner's motivation flows from her mute quarter and thirty years of silent dedication, with embodied details like "fingertips reading micro-oscillations." Her final choice to leave the sculpture and pass the bronze wedge shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "wonder's frequency" that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the comet activates the sculpture, creating light-music that validates the tuner's life work, then she descends to pass on the practice. The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Cost is visible in the thirty years invested and the silent quarter sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity: "sweating cold diamonds," "ribbons of unseen hues," "micro-oscillations the way blind priests read breath-scriptures." The bluff setting constrains choices (thinned air, isolation) and the iceberg fragment's physical properties drive the climactic transformation. Environment and objects consistently shape action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: years of assembly → final calibration → comet arrival → sculpture activation. The dominant stake (preserving wonder's frequency) tightens as the comet approaches. Cost manifests in the tuner's seasonal muteness and thirty-year dedication, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sculpture's function: "wonder is not a feeling but a frequency." The final image of passing the bronze wedge to the boy powerfully reweights the opening's solitary climb. Subtext operates through silence itself as communication, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: "continents were rumors, oceans dull sheets." POV control remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Lyric compression serves the piece well, though occasional phrases like "tomorrow's children will place their unborn voices" drift toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid precision, but several instances of overwriting: "dawn behind the eyes," "symphony of truth orbiting itself." Some register drift into elevated diction ("ionic glow," "resonant cavity") that occasionally obscures immediacy. Information density is high but sometimes tips into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of musical, geological, and astronomical elements into a coherent artistic vision. The concept of a kinetic monument activated by a comet to preserve "wonder's frequency" feels genuinely fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and the mute protagonist heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
