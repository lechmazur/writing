<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The performer's moral ambiguity manifests through concrete contradictory actions (reporting neighbors/forging joy coupons), and her blank-faced performance becomes a deliberate stance against enforced emotion. The officer's parallel journey from enforcer to participant shows earned transformation through shared action. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "lightness in grief" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms from prohibited to cultivatable through the planted stems and the valley's potential forgiveness. The crow's impossible speech creates a lyric turn that reweights the entire silence ordinance. Cost is visible in the "fined and jailed" ghosts and the officer's scratched-blank badge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The turbines function as active oppressors ("snatching" shavings, creating "remade hush") that constrain every action, while the dried flowers evolve from props to planted hope. The farmhouse porch becomes a stage for resistance. Environment directly shapes the final image of the wrapper as "flag for the morally ambiguous."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal cultivation of grief to collective valley transformation, with the officer's arrival forcing crystallization of stance. The crow's intervention deepens the resistance metaphor. Minor limitation: the magical realism of the speaking crow slightly diffuses the earned causality, though it works within the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central question of how to exist authentically under oppressive mandates receives a resonant answer through the planted stems—grief as necessary soil for future growth. The wrapper-flag transforms from container of death to announcement of ambiguous survival. Subtext operates beautifully through the narrated mundane actions as coded resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends bureaucratic documentation ("Item: hydration deprivation complete") with lyric perception ("three-armed giants choreographing a remade hush"). The performer's theatrical narration creates layers of meaning. Clean POV control throughout with purposeful compression serving the allegory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "grief is soil, and hush is the shovel" carrying multiple functions. Strong rhythm variation between the performer's formal narration and descriptive passages. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("lightness in grief") and one instance of slight overwriting in the turbine descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The happiness mandate dystopia offers fresh specificity through "joy coupons" and "laughter compliance officer," avoiding generic tyranny. The talking crow risks cliché but transforms into earned surrealism within this world's logic. The image of whittling as resistance and the dried bouquet's evolution show genuine ingenuity.</comment>
