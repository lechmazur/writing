<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The performer's moral ambiguity—reporting neighbors then forging joy coupons—creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices. Her cultivation of "lightness in grief" through ritualistic narration shows embodied coping under the happiness mandate's aftermath. The crow's speaking moment strains credibility but the performer's response through whittling reveals character through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through whittling, narration, dried flowers, and collaborative carving toward the planted stems receiving rain. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the empty bouquet wrapper becomes "a flag for the morally ambiguous," reweighting grief as something allowed to "weigh something." Cost is conceptual but legible in the transformation from enforced happiness to permitted grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turbines' "three-armed giants choreographing a remade hush" constrains every action, from catching wood shavings to making "every heartbeat feel like vandalism." Setting actively shapes choices—the silence ordinance forces her to label scratching as "dirge." The planted stems darkening with a single tear provides environmental response to character action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal grief cultivation to collective valley healing as the officer joins the whittling and the crow participates. The performer's agency drives escalation through narrating, planting stems, and "watering nothing with an empty can" until sky responds. Cost is visible in the "skeleton honest enough to carry future blossoms" and grief being "allowed to weigh something."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of cultivating "lightness in grief" under enforced silence after mandated happiness. The dried flowers transforming to bare stems that might "carry future blossoms" resonates without stating meaning. "Grief is soil and hush is the shovel; what we plant is voluntary, what grows is not" avoids moralizing while capturing the story's complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent blank affect through "the emotional void that passed for voice" and clinical narration style ("Item: hydration deprivation complete"). The crow speaking disrupts naturalism momentarily but recovers through the performer's matter-of-fact response. Dialogue between performer and officer stays compressed and metaphorical, fitting the remade hush context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("television left on after the station signed off") but suffers from density overload in places. Some metaphors strain ("an infant made of endings"). The clinical itemization provides rhythmic variation but occasionally feels forced. Final image of the wrapper as "flag for the morally ambiguous" lands effectively despite earlier density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The happiness mandate/silence ordinance dystopia offers fresh angle on grief and enforced emotion. Specific details like "forged joy coupons" and "laughter compliance officer" create original world-building. The crow's speech risks gimmickry but the collaborative whittling and rain response elevate beyond surface cleverness.</comment>
