<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's ghostly altruism drives collective action through subtle manipulation of temperature and frost, with her final dissolution into the nebula representing earned transformation. The colonists' progression from quarreling strangers to unified harvesters shows genuine character arc, though some emotional beats rely on abstraction ("brambled hope") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara dissolves into the nebula itself, becoming a permanent reservoir of respite with clear cost (her individual identity). The accumulative lens holds as her chalk messages, bell-ringing, and orchard-saving build toward collective transformation, with the final image of children feeling "unexplainable trust" paying off the established pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and gravity-defying orchards create genuine spatial pressure that constrains the harvest solution, particularly when "one ladder alone tilts the sky." The butterfly garden and watering bell anchor repeated actions, though some worldbuilding elements (anti-grav seeds, nebula physics) remain more decorative than constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual ghost-human trust to collective survival through the dying anti-grav seeds, with the coordinated harvest requiring specific human-chain formations. The cost manifests physically as Mara becomes "the counterweight no scale had predicted," though the resolution feels slightly too smooth given the initial mistrust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of collective survival emerging from individual sacrifice resonates through concrete actions—Mara's dissolution enables permanent communal respite, while "survival is a collective verb" lands without preaching. The brambled hope metaphor (beauty that hurts) effectively captures the story's emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The omniscient voice maintains consistent distance and handles the ghost POV gracefully, though occasional abstractions ("brambled hope," "reservoir of respite") drift toward purple prose. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the narrative relies heavily on lyrical description that occasionally obscures immediate action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("condensation swirling where her ankles should have been") but suffers from repetitive abstract constructions around "brambled hope" and occasional overwriting ("the violet itself, a reservoir of respite ready to catch the next wave of grief"). Some sentences prioritize lyricism over clarity, particularly in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-community-organizer premise offers fresh perspective on posthumous agency, particularly through the frost-writing mechanism. However, the resolution toward collective harmony feels somewhat expected, and the worldbuilding elements (twin suns, floating orchards) don't fully escape genre conventions despite specific details.</comment>
