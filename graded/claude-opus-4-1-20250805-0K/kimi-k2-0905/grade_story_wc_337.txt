<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation builds through concrete embodied detail (thumb on fracture lines "like fault lines in his own chest") and culminates in a meaningful change from mask restorer to voice-giver. The fisherman's spirit shows genuine struggle through specific losses (wife on cliffs, children fearing sea). Deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("accumulated silence," "interlaced hush") that occasionally replaces embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught silence/voice motif that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms from mending masks to giving voices back. Cost is visible in the fisherman's release and Elian's new understanding. Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptual framing that could be more grounded in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's crystalline walls that refract starlight into "spectral colors" and the ancient net with "knots dark with age and sorrow" constrain Elian's work and charge the final transformation. The sanctuary as a space where "time moved differently" shapes the narrative's dreamlike quality. Slight deduction for occasional generic mystical descriptions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each knot releases more silence and story, building to the fisherman's materialization and eventual freedom. The cost is felt in "what I never said" and the weight of accumulated silence. Deduction for relatively passive escalation that relies more on revelation than active choice in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of broken things that "let the light through" and voices trapped in silence. The final insight that broken masks are "maps" rather than failures offers resonant non-literal answer. Strong integration of mask/voice/silence motifs throughout without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and mystical register appropriate to the sanctuary setting. Clean POV control throughout with purposeful compression. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated diction ("phosphorescence in the net's fibers") that slightly distances the reader during key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery and good momentum. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("interlaced hush," "accumulated silence") without clear pattern-teaching. Occasional abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest of his new understanding") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration with soul-unbinding creates non-obvious angle on ghost story tropes. The specific detail of the tapestry needle "threaded with moonlight" and nets as story-containers shows originality. The transformation from physical repair to spiritual release feels earned and specific to this world.</comment>
