I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered storytelling and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where listening itself becomes the transformative act.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to prove "listening heals" drives consistent micro-choices: offering tea for stories, using the borescope, then abandoning tools for presence. The shift from curator-investigator to witness shows genuine internal conflict acted out through concrete choices, though peak emotional embodiment could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Earned Stasis closure—Mira accepting the mailbox's need to be witnessed rather than opened—lands with clear cost as she transforms her shop into a receptacle "For whatever returns." The accumulative structure coheres as neighborhood stories layer into collective listening, with the locket's heartbeat serving as the persistent constraint that shapes her final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as more than backdrop—its rose-gold dawn light, cooling tiles, and spatial choreography of the "quiet crescent" actively shape the communal ritual. The mailbox's physical presence (its "rusted jaw," metal that conducts sound) constrains Mira's investigation methods, though some sensory details remain visually dominant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from curiosity about the rattling mailbox through collective memory of Dr. Samara to the community's need for witnessed grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mira abandons her tools and accepts witnessing over solving, with visible cost in transforming her shop's purpose, though intermediate pressure points could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the parallel between Dr. Samara's listening practice and Mira's discovery that "some locks exist only to teach us the shape of the key we already are." The final image of offerings left on the empty cushion resonantly reweights the entire investigation without stating its moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Mira's interiority with phrases like "felt the tale settle like dust between her ribs." However, occasional register elevation ("the calm of a sandstorm that has spent itself against mountains") and some filter-verb clustering ("she heard, or imagined she heard") slightly blur the voice's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong images like "the way sand waits for wind," but several paraphrase loops appear ("listening, not answers, is what finally heals" restates the motivation). Template cadence runs in the middle section ("She set...arranged...waited"; "They said...swore...began") and occasional purple patches ("plum to peach") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of thrift-shop curation with community grief-witnessing offers a non-obvious angle on healing narratives. The specific detail of the locket-as-heartbeat and the transformation of a commercial space into a receptacle for "whatever returns" elevates familiar material through earned particularity.</comment>
