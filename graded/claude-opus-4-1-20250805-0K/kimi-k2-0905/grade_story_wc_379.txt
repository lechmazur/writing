I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered storytelling and communal listening toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes from curator to witness with genuine embodied tension ("felt the tale settle like dust between her ribs"). The final internalization of the locket's click into her chest earns the transformation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("the calm of a sandstorm that has spent itself").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative structure with coherent layering of stories building to Earned Stasis—Mira choosing witnessing over solving. The closure lands with felt cost as the community transforms through collective listening. Slight deduction for the conceptual leap in "some locks exist only to teach us the shape of the key we already are" which edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as active setting constraining choices—the locked mailbox becomes the focal point that reorganizes space and community. Excellent sensory hierarchy ("rose-gold at dawn," "tiles still cool underfoot"). The physical space transforms meaningfully from commerce to communion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from rumor to investigation to communal witnessing. Mira's renunciation of opening the box in favor of witnessing represents genuine agency with visible cost. The pressure coheres well under the textural lens as stories layer toward transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between solving and witnessing, with the locket's heartbeat serving as effective subtext. Deduction for the final line's explicit articulation of theme ("some locks exist only to teach us...") which undermines the otherwise subtle development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sand waits for wind," "darkness breathing"). Clean focalization through Mira with no head-hopping. The rhythmic control particularly shines in accumulative passages where syntax mirrors the gathering of stories.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong prose rhythm with varied sentence structures supporting the accumulative build. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional elevated diction that drifts from Mira's established register ("valve none knew was pressurized").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of thrift shop curator with community listener feels fresh and specific. The transformation of commercial space into sacred witnessing ground shows genuine originality. The locked mailbox as repository of unheard grief avoids cliché through particular execution.</comment>
