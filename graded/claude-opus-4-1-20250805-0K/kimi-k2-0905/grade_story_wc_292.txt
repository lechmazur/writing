<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation through ancestral legacy drives every choice with clear internal stakes. The "nervously confident" trait manifests in her drumming the copper nail while pursuing forbidden knowledge. Minor deduction for some emotional summary in middle beats ("the gravitational pull of legacy") rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based decoding building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara chooses to stay and transform the station into a memory archive. Closure lands with visible cost—she could return but sacrifices that freedom to preserve overlooked histories. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph 2 to fully anchor the weather station setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The weather station's experimental nature and constant storms create atmospheric pressure throughout. The copper nail functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when it "pulsed against her throat." Doesn't quite reach 9-band because while the spongy plankwalk and mildewed walls are vivid, the environment could more directly shape tactical choices in middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (cataloging journals) through collaborative (Voss joining the search) to transformative (creating the sky-library). The question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?" forces Voss's reversal. Cost is visible when Mara chooses extended exile over return, though middle pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased heroism emerges through concrete discovery of Edda's sacrifice saving refugee convoy. The reversal that those saved included future ministers' ancestors offers complex irony without moralizing. Final image of encoding memory in weather patterns resonantly answers the central question about what truths need remembering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lexicon ("spongey plankwalk," "verdigris," "micro-maps"). POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature of seeing patterns others dismiss. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match character voice ("gravitational pull of legacy," "anonymous dread").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of elevated diction drift from POV ("the gravitational pull of legacy," "anonymous dread," "purposeful direction") and some paraphrase loops around the decoding process. The "nervously confident" becomes a tell-phrase rather than embodied behavior after the opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather station as archive and jet stream as library carrier. The salt-cipher and inverted micro-maps offer specific innovation. The reversal that erasure protects the erasers' ancestors adds non-obvious complexity, though some elements feel slightly constructed rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Map librarian identity drives the entire quest—her professional skills enable decoding the salt-cipher and assembling micro-maps. Her choice to transform the station into a living archive directly extends her vocation. Would score higher if her specific librarian techniques were more detailed in the decoding scenes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Copper nail appears throughout: nervously drummed pendant, pulsing against throat during discovery, "rechristened as a stylus" for etching coordinates. Its verdigris color links to Edda's thumbprint. Strong integration though could be more causally essential to the decoding process itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile concept structures the entire story—Mara invokes the Act, discovers how to reverse erasure rather than banishment, then chooses to extend exile to preserve memory. The concept redefines what "reversal" means through action. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Opens with nervous drumming on pendant, shows confident assembly of maps with trembling hands. The trait shapes her approach but becomes more told than embodied in middle sections. Returns at closure with greeting new exiles, though could constrain more choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Questioning drives every major turn: challenges Ministry's denial, breaks Voss's resistance with the key question about inconvenient bravery, ends with encoding questions in weather. The story would collapse without this action as its engine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Salt-cipher and coded stanzas provide specific decoding method shown in detail. Semaphore shapes in water damage and inverted micro-maps create unique mechanics. Method shapes multiple beats though arrives slightly late (paragraph 4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weather station's isolation enables forbidden research, experimental equipment (kites, weather array, holotable) provides tools for discovery, restricted test zone makes wreck accessible. The station becomes transformed into memory archive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jet stream shift creates the permanent storms, enables journal preservation in shoals, becomes the medium for memory transmission. Timeline structures the fourteen-day discovery process. Could more actively pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Honoring Edda's bravery motivates every action from requesting exile through staying to preserve all overlooked stories. The ironic discovery that Edda saved the erasers' ancestors deepens the motivation. Dramatized through choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spongey dread permeates through plankwalk texture, mildewed walls, screaming barometers, sky "glowing color of old pennies." Tone shifts from dread through discovery to purposeful transformation, charging the final image of rain falling "with purposeful direction instead of anonymous dread."</comment>
