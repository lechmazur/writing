<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between cynicism and need drives genuine change, with her offering the shell back marking a credible shift from hoarding to releasing hope. The dissolved characters becoming part of her embodies contradiction effectively ("Heat spread; Mara felt sentences rearranging themselves beneath her sternum"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around hope as "angular" without fuller embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-driven closure where collected hopes transform Mara internally, enabling her to finish the novel. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as she releases the hopes she desperately needed to collect. Orientation anchors effectively (novelist, nexus, seeking unfinished hopes), and the final image of the shell as "private lighthouse" reweights all prior collecting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nexus functions as active setting that delivers characters and forces choices, while fog that "curled into quotation marks" and tasted of "salt and wet paper" creates specific atmosphere. The seashell fragment transforms from ear trumpet to lighthouse, constraining and enabling action throughout. Deduction for some abstract spatial choreography at the nexus that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting hopes for survival to accepting them internally at personal cost, with the vortex of "almost-voices" creating peak pressure. The choice to offer back the shell rather than hoard represents meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible as hopes dissolve into Mara, fundamentally changing her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation from collecting/hoarding to releasing, with the line "collecting hopes was not hoarding but releasing them, against the current, into the living world" earning its resonance through prior dramatization. The recurring "against the current" gains meaning through Mara's journey from resistance to acceptance. Final lighthouse image offers non-literal answer about creative responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with literary register appropriate to novelist protagonist, using phrases like "feral nexus" and "marginalia" that fit her perceptual signature. Clean free indirect style throughout with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for slight convergence of character voices (boy, pianist, Lira) which could be more differentiated despite their ethereal nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "fog funneled into the spiral, polishing its ridges." Some repetitive phrasing around "swirling hush" (appears 3 times) and moderate figurative density in places without full payoff. The phrase "Word count pressed at her shoulders like gentle hands" feels forced. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of metafictional elements with the concept of unfinished hopes taking physical form at a tidal nexus. The transformation of abandoned characters into sources of creative courage offers genuine insight. Specific details like the pianist's unresolved chord becoming quartz avoid generic abstraction. Modest risk-taking in the meta-commentary about word count.</comment>
