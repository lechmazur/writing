<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from cartographer to corridor/echo fusion is earned through discovery of her lineage and the building's photographic nature, with visible cost as she loses physical form. The "sensitively perceptive" trait drives her ability to hear older frequencies and track the echo to its source. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("name rise in her throat like a stone") rather than fully embodied emotion in middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design where density increases through ivy/film/memory motifs until Mira becomes the corridor echo she was hired to trace—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (loss of human form). The recursive structure (finding herself at age seven in the tunnel she's discovering) and the building-as-camera revelation create coherent pressure. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the when ("2081" reference helps retroactively).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as both setting and mechanism (camera shutter), with film negatives as developing medium—environment directly shapes the transformation. Strong sensory work with "choked gurgle of rainwater pipes" and negatives "brushing her face." The maintenance hatch and service tunnel provide spatial constraint that forces the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries: hearing the echo → finding diaries → seeing herself in negatives → discovering her lineage → entering the tunnel → becoming the corridor. Each revelation tightens the trap of "legacy's burden" until transformation becomes inevitable. The cost is visceral: Mira loses human form to become what she sought to map.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of legacy's burden emerges through the building-as-camera concept, where walls preserve all joy and grief, making inheritance a trap. The final image of Mira "walking backward through time, mapping the dreams of stone" resonantly answers what it means to carry ancestral memory. The recursive hiring of new cartographers suggests cyclical entrapment without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with architectural/photographic lexicon ("silver halide," "developing trays," "negative space") that supports the concept. Perceptual signature strong in how Mira processes sound and space. Some register elevation in places ("lung of moss and dripping memory") works mostly but occasionally strains; psychic distance control wavers slightly when shifting between action and reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("blackened edges fluttering like moth wings," "film negative strip curled like a sleeping serpent"). Deductions for repetitive structure in the diary section ("Vale wrote that...," "The diaries had warned...") and some abstract phrasing ("pure cadence, a heartbeat of guilt"). Information density high in most beats but occasional redundancy ("echo she pursued"/"echo she had been hired to trace").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The building-as-camera concept is genuinely inventive, transforming the haunted-building trope through photographic mechanics. The recursive structure (Mira finding herself as a child in negatives, then becoming what she sought) offers fresh temporal complexity. Risk-taking in the transformation ending where protagonist becomes infrastructure pays off thematically (+0.3 within band).</comment>
