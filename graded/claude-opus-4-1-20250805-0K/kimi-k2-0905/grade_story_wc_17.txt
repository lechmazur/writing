<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's discovery of her lineage through acoustic perception and the building-as-camera revelation creates genuine internal conflict, with her transformation into corridor echo serving as earned, irreversible cost. The "sensitively perceptive" trait drives every major beat, from hearing pre-flood murmurs to recognizing herself in negatives. Minor deduction for the rescue team's discovery feeling slightly detached from Mira's embodied experience in the tunnel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (negatives, echoes, ivy) building to Mira's absorption into the building's memory—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. The recursive structure (her childhood self already in the tunnel) and building-as-camera revelation reweight all prior exploration. Slight dock for the rescue team coda which, while thematically apt, arrives after the primary closure already landed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as both literal space and developing apparatus, with film strips as physical memory constraining Mira's final choice. Sensory hierarchy privileges sound over sight ("corridor echo," "murmurs," "heartbeat of guilt"), fitting the cartographer's expertise. The tunnel of negatives creates visceral spatial progression where touching strips triggers visions, making setting inseparable from action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional mapping to discovering family legacy to becoming trapped in the building's recursive memory. The tension between inheritance ("legacy's burden") and erasure drives Mira deeper despite mounting evidence of danger. Cost is visceral—she literally becomes what she was hired to trace—though the agency in her final transformation could be slightly more contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of "legacy's burden" as both textual refrain and embodied fate, with the building-as-camera concept reframing architecture as memory apparatus. The final image of Mira walking backward through time while others hear her counting "footsteps that never arrived" creates haunting resonance without stating meaning. Subtext operates through the negatives showing reversed reality where "light became shadow."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("silver halide," "photosensitive gel") with lyrical compression ("lung of moss and dripping memory," "corridors narrowing like clogged arteries"). POV control remains tight to Mira's perceptual field, with the corridor's "sigh" and ivy functioning as extensions of her sensitive hearing. Minor dock for rescue team section shifting to external view, though it serves closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density, with lines like "walls dream about the shapes they once contained" doing multiple jobs. Some repetition of "negative" and "corridor echo" serves accumulative pattern rather than loop. Slight overreliance on participial phrases in middle section ("Following the ivy-veiled passage," "walking the tunnel") creates minor momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The building-as-camera concept with ivy as shutter and storms as flash powder offers genuinely fresh architectural metaphor. The recursive time structure (Mira age seven already in the undiscovered tunnel) and transformation of job into fate avoid predictable haunted-building tropes. Risk-taking with the meta-cyclical ending where the position is reposted pays off thematically (+0.3).</comment>
