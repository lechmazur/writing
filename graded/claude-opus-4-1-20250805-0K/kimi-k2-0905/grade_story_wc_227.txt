<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details (forehead pressed to porthole, trembling behind mask) and her internal contradiction between preservation and sacrifice drives the closure choice with visible cost. The "uncertain alchemist's hands" worried the charm while she makes a certain choice establishes character-specific tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira accepts death to restore the statue, with visible cost (workshop sinking, her drowning). The accumulative lens holds as pockmark-mapping builds to transformation, though the mechanism of how matching patterns heals marble remains slightly opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acid sea constrains every choice through corroding chains and time pressure, while the workshop's groaning gears create lived-in specificity. The statue's pockmarks as "star map of ruin" and the charm's golden seams provide textural detail that shapes the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal grief (mother's heartbeat) to sacrificial choice as chains snap one by one. The countdown creates undeniable pressure with visible cost as Lira straps herself to the chair knowing she'll drown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the kintsugi metaphor—broken things made whole through golden repair—without stating morals. The final image of the charm rising "toward whatever sky waited" offers resonant answer to whether meaning can endure beyond the vessel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through technical vocabulary ("specimen tray," "copper stylus") and rhythm control ("Chain two snapped. The workshop listed"). The refrain "between breaths held underwater" creates effective patterning though occasional register elevation ("liturgy," "tectonic teeth") slightly strains the alchemist POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied sentence lengths and the chain-countdown creates momentum. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("tectonic teeth grinding," "star reversing gravity") and minor filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "felt") reduce immediacy without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kintsugi-as-memory-healing concept offers fresh angle on sacrifice narratives, with specific texture in the acid sea setting. The transformation feels earned through established pattern-matching, though the core "meaning vs. vessel" theme follows recognizable templates.</comment>
