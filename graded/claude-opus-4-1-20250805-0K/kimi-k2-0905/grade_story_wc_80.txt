I'll evaluate this literary story according to the demanding editorial standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied ("winced as if the sound had come from inside her own chest"), with clear motivation driving her ritual of placing notes in cracks. The transformation from foundation certifier to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" provides earned character arc. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional moments ("stoically sensitive communion") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration - Mara's ritual transforms the pavilion into a repository of memory with visible cost (the lightened inkwell, walking away without looking back). The pattern of placing notes builds density through repetition with variation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active constraint - the submerged pavilion's architecture ("circular void where the keystone should have been") directly shapes Mara's final act of writing on stone. The "code of hollows she alone could read" makes environment inseparable from character expertise. Sensory details filtered through professional POV ("slick granite coping," "hydraulic lime").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes clearly signaled - documenting whether the pavilion can be saved while secretly preserving abandoned dreams. Escalation through deepening ritual (paper notes → direct inscription on stone) with meaningful cost. The "scheduled betrayal" of the tide creates time pressure, though could benefit from one more turn of complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete act of "stitching a wound shut with thread made of light" - preservation as both technical and emotional work. The final image of future scholars finding fragments offers resonant answer to the central question of what endures. No explicit moralizing; meaning arises from accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Mara reads architecture ("hush of arches and moonlit ribs"). Prose rhythm modulates effectively with scene needs. Minor inconsistency in register with phrases like "stoically sensitive" that feel slightly authorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots kissing the wet marble steps that descended into darkness, each footfall echoing like a dropped coin"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("stitching a wound shut with thread made of light") but generally strong propulsion. Occasional abstract phrasing ("interlaced absence") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architectural survey with emotional archaeology creates non-obvious angle. The specific detail of placing confessions in structural repairs transforms familiar loss/memory themes. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode pays off with earned resonance rather than surface quirk.</comment>
