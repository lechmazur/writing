<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's "stoically sensitive" nature manifests through concrete embodied reactions (wincing at gull cries "as if the sound had come from inside her own chest") and her methodical ritual of placing confessions in foundation cracks. Her transformation from certifying what stands to documenting "abandoned dreams" shows clear internal evolution with visible cost. The contradictory impulses of professional duty versus personal mourning play out through action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Mara's ritual of placing notes building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes "lighter by exactly the amount of a confession." The closure lands with conceptual cost as she transforms from surveyor to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams," with each sealed note a "suture" of memory. Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when established in opening lines), and the single-scene structure maintains coherent pressure through her descent and return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as both setting and crucible, its "interlaced absences" directly constraining Mara's movements and shaping her documentary method. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("rusted chains...swaying like censers that had forgotten their prayers"). The environment actively shapes choices—the water level, the fissures accepting notes, the missing keystone all drive specific actions that couldn't occur elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's need to document/mourn "what we almost kept"—deepens through accumulation as each note placed increases emotional weight. Her agency manifests through the deliberate ritual of confession-placing, with visible cost in the "lighter" inkwell and her walking away "without looking back." The tightening occurs through the progression from placing paper notes to writing directly on stone, escalating intimacy with the ruins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "interlaced absence" where missing elements reveal meaning, never stated but embodied in Mara's actions. The notes themselves ("You loved me only when the band played waltzes") carry subtext about lost love without exposition. The final image of future scholars finding her "fragments" offers a non-literal answer about how abandoned dreams achieve permanence through documentation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation appropriate to Mara's perspective, with selective perception reflecting her surveyor's eye ("slick granite coping," "hydraulic lime"). No dialogue appears, allowing interiority to dominate through free indirect style. Rhythmic control heightens at peak moments ("each sentence was a suture, each sealed fissure a blaze so hushed it burned only in the mind").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("tessellations by the ripples"). Some metaphorical strain exists ("stitching a wound shut with thread made of light") but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is strong—nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, character state, or symbolic weight. Minor repetition of "interlaced absence" and slight register elevation in places ("stoically sensitive communion") create friction without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of placing confessional notes inside foundation repairs while conducting a structural survey offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of professional expertise with personal mourning ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking through the lyric mode and absence-as-presence metaphor heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
