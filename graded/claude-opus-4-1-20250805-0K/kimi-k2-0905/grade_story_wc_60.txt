I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through a pattern of fountain visits, each revealing a memory, with density increasing toward the final release.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent - liberation rather than grief - with embodied contradictions shown through her "luminous skeptic" nature and testing weight in hands. The progression from skepticism to acknowledgment is earned through concrete fountain encounters. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sidereal patience") that occasionally distances from embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure with four fountain visits building to memory release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - memories dissolve, geese resume flight, silence transforms from absence to acceptance. Cost is visible in Mara's acknowledgment of her own abandonment pattern. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains effectively constrains choices through dry basins and specific fountain names that shape each memory encounter. Setting functions beyond description - the fountains' states (dry, glass, mirrors) directly enable memory access. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the four locations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating trapped memories) signals early and deepens through each fountain revealing personal abandonment patterns. The third fountain forces Mara to confront her own perpetuation of the cycle. Final cost is legible as she releases control and speaks "not as a skeptic but as a daughter."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pattern of abandonment across generations without explicit moralizing. The transformation of "defiant hush" from absence to acceptance resonates without stating a lesson. The stained glass box as "constellation of regrets" effectively physicalizes the family's emotional inheritance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("breadcrumbs of light," "sidereal patience"). POV control is stable throughout with no head-hopping. Slight deduction for occasional elevation that strains the "realistically imaginative" characterization ("galaxy of abandonment").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition ("defiant hush" bookends effectively). Information density is high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("constellation of regrets," "sidereal patience of stars long dead") without becoming opaque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of memories trapped in a stained glass box waiting with "sidereal patience" offers a fresh angle on generational trauma. The specific fountain names and their transformations (water to glass, to mirrors) create memorable particulars. Integration of magical realism with emotional truth feels organic.</comment>
