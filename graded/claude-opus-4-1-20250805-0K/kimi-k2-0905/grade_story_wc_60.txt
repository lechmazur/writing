I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through a pattern of fountain visits that reweight memory and abandonment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's "realistically imaginative" trait manifests concretely through her testing the box's weight and following breadcrumbs. The progression from skeptic to daughter shows earned change through specific fountain encounters. Internal conflict plays out through her speaking to the box "not as a skeptic but as a daughter," though some emotional beats rely on abstract phrasing ("sidereal patience") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure teaches its pattern early through fountain visits, each revealing a family memory of abandonment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when memories release "like steam" and the "defiant hush" transforms from absence to "things finally let go." However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see the memories dissolve but don't feel Mara's specific loss in releasing them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fountains constrain Mara's journey effectively—each dry basin holds specific memory types that shape her path. "Water no longer flowed but the memory of it lingered" establishes the setting's logic. The paused geese create temporal suspension that releases only when memories dissolve. Setting directly enables the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through fountain progression: First Lies → Last Goodbyes → Unkept Promises → Forgiveness, each revealing deeper betrayals culminating in Mara's own abandonment of a child. The stakes deepen from passive receipt of abandonment to active perpetuation. The final release of memories carries weight, though the emotional cost could be more viscerally rendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the fountain names and memory progression without explicit moralizing. The transformation of "defiant hush" from absence to release resonates. "The memories did not ask for forgiveness—they asked only to be seen" avoids tidy resolution. The pattern of inherited abandonment surfaces through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "luminous skeptic" and "sidereal patience." The controlled distance serves the fable-like tone. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("constellation of regrets") in ways that feel more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the meditative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty: "geese pause mid-flight, their wings frozen in the sky like a photograph." Some figurative density in emotional beats ("constellation of regrets," "galaxy of her family's abandonment") borders on overwriting. Template repetition appears in fountain sequences but serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The fountain taxonomy (First Lies, Last Goodbyes, Unkept Promises, Forgiveness) offers fresh specificity. Combining stained glass memory container with dry fountains creates an original symbolic system. The revelation that Mara perpetuates the abandonment pattern adds complexity, though the magical realist frame is familiar territory.</comment>
