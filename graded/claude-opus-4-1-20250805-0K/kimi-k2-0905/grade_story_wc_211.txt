<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambrose's contradictory impulses—destroying vs. preserving the prophecy—act simultaneously in the basin scene, with his final choice to remain as the city's subsonic grief earned through the childhood vision callback. The cost is visible as he transforms from archivist to archive, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis: Ambrose accepts becoming the foghorn's vessel, with cost legible in his transmutation "into the soft velvet disquiet." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (wax shaving, quince faces, Hittite words) build pressure toward this crystallized stance, though the childhood vision feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard constrains choice—Ambrose must decide within this ancient space before it vanishes—and charges the final image of trees transmuting into urban disquiet. Sensory precision (caramel wax curl, quince-juice ink, xylem absorption) creates a lived-in mystical realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation deepens through accumulation: foghorn silence → wax prophecy → childhood vision → accepting transformation, with the dominant stake (archiving vs. becoming archived) tightening when the orchard itself will vanish. Cost is felt in Ambrose's final waiting, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ending reweights "to remain" from curse to vocation without stating a moral—the foghorn's migration into human vessel emerges through concrete particulars (wax, ink, bark). Theme develops through the pattern of voices persisting in unexpected forms, from Edison cylinders to living archives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through specialized attention (consecrated tweezers, xylem absorption, microscopic grooves) and rhythmic control sustains lyric pressure. Some register elevation in peak moments ("soft velvet disquiet") slightly exceeds the established voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the wax shaving is warm/musical/prophetic simultaneously), though occasional abstraction ("the archive had inverted") and slight template cadence in the middle reduce immediacy. Final image achieves strong propulsion through concrete transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of phonograph technology with ancient prophecy feels non-obvious, and the specific detail of childhood precognition through a state fair cylinder creates originality. Risk-taking in the lyric-mystical mode heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
