<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naram-bel's motivation is clear and rooted in his frugal devotion to mathematics over empire, with the magic square purchase demonstrating seven years of sacrifice. His transformation from fearful empiricist to covenant-keeper shows earned change through discovery. The internal conflict between empirical skepticism and longing for transcendence plays out concretely through his actions with the tile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through geometric revelation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Naram-bel becomes "the silence between regimes." Closure lands with visible cost—his physical disappearance and eternal guardianship. The orientation anchors (palace, dusk, astronomer) establish clearly by line 2, and causality holds as each discovery enables the next.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The palace setting constrains choices through its liminal state "between regimes" and the forbidden sanctum door that requires the magic square to open. Sensory details like "dust floated like pale constellations" and "glazed bricks murmuring equations" create atmosphere while advancing the mystical premise. The clerestory and hollow cube function as discovery spaces that enable the covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving astronomical knowledge before foreign conquest—escalates through Naram-bel's schematic discovery, the sanctum opening, and his final covenant choice. Each revelation narrows options: from observation to action to eternal guardianship. The cost manifests as his physical disappearance and perpetual duty, though the middle development could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between empirical knowledge and mystical devotion, with the "empirical irony" that pure number, not ritual, unlocks the sacred. The final image of visitors sensing "encrypted devotion" in the palace walls resonantly answers whether mathematics can outlast empire. Subtext operates through the sister reference and the covenant's unspoken terms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with Naram-bel's perceptual signature favoring mathematical and astronomical details. Voice modulates effectively from cautious observation to awed discovery, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("dusky harmony of twilight"). The prose texture suits the scholarly protagonist and mystical subject matter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery moments. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, elevated diction occasionally obscures clarity ("empirically ironic that pure number"), and some phrases like "dusky harmony" and "encrypted devotion" repeat without evolution, creating mild template effects.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a mathematician-astronomer using geometric magic to preserve knowledge between conquests offers a fresh synthesis of historical and fantastical elements. The specific detail of bartering seven years of barley for the tile and the transformation of mathematical patterns into dimensional doorways shows originality. The ending's quiet disappearance rather than confrontation demonstrates risk-taking.</comment>
