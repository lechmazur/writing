<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through concrete details like threading the filament and releasing memory kites, with her "quietly explosive" resolve manifesting in deliberate actions rather than labels. The final choice to step out "not falling but floating" represents earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional phrasing ("quietly explosive heart") that briefly slips into label-speak during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the gondola's imminent fall providing temporal pressure while Mara completes her mother's work. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara becomes part of the sky's memory, with visible cost in her transformation into "dusty starlight." The cable snapping beat-by-beat creates escalating urgency that forces her final renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gondola setting constrains choices through its precarious single cable and limited time, while the telescope's hidden chamber enables the recording of cloud emotions. Sensory details like "wicker floor shedding dust that floated in zero-g like miniature galaxies" integrate setting with action. The environment actively shapes Mara's tactics as altitude drops force her to release the kites before stepping out.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the cable's progressive failure ("each pop a syllable in the sky's last sentence") forcing Mara to accelerate her documentation. The dominant stake—preserving her mother's theory before the gondola falls—tightens as altitude drops from 31,000 to 30,600 feet. Cost is legible in Mara's final transformation where she becomes the proof itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of categorizing emotional clouds, with the telescope becoming a generational repository of sky memories. The final image of Mara transforming into "dusty starlight" offers a non-literal answer about how memory persists in empty spaces. Each released kite carries specific emotional readings that accumulate meaning without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive phrasings like "cradle for the last witness of spooled wholeness" and selective perception focused on meteorological phenomena. The perceptual signature shows in how Mara notices clouds as emotions and interprets physical sensations through her mother's lexicon. Some register elevation in peak moments ("memorialize in mid-air") slightly exceeds the established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines like "The gondola creaked like an old porch swing, its wicker floor shedding dust that floated in zero-g like miniature galaxies" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("quietly explosive, a filament bulb about to shatter with feeling") and occasional synonym loops around memory/remember concepts. Strong propulsion through varied sentence structures that accelerate during the final sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of clouds as emotional memory storage transforms a familiar meteorological observation into fresh territory, with three generations of aviation meteorologists adding personal stakes. The specificity of "regret tastes like burnt coffee and airport goodbyes" grounds abstraction in concrete detail. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and the protagonist's transformation into the phenomenon she studies heightens coherence (+0.3).</comment>
