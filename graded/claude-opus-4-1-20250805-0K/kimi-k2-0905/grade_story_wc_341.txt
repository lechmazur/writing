<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove her mother's cloud-emotion theory drives clear, escalating choices culminating in her stepping out of the gondola—a genuine cost. Her internal state ("quieter, more explosive") manifests through concrete actions like releasing memory kites and threading the filament. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("quietly explosive heart") in peak moments rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward Mara's final step into empty space—a Decisive Change with visible cost (her life). The closure lands powerfully with the telescope falling as proof, though the final paragraph's slight abstraction ("empty spaces keep every feeling") weakens the otherwise strong on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gondola functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—the fraying cable creates urgency, the wicker floor enables the release mechanism. Sensory details ("dusty starlight," "bruised nimbostratus pulsing with regret") are POV-filtered and purposeful. The telescope and filament operate as setting elements that shape the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from recording cloud emotions to preserving this knowledge before death, with the cable snapping providing coherent pressure. Mara's agency drives the escalation through threading the filament, releasing kites, and stepping out. The cost is unmistakable—her life for the proof.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete metaphor of clouds as emotional memory, avoiding explicit moralizing until the very end. The final image of the falling telescope as "spooled wholeness" resonantly answers whether emotions persist in empty spaces. Slight deduction for the final line's mild abstraction of the thematic point.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive lyrical register with controlled compression ("a cradle for the last witness of spooled wholeness"). The perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices through meteorological and emotional lenses. Minor repetition in syntactic patterns ("Tell them...") works as intentional litany.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density and purposeful rhythm, particularly in lines like "cities flicking on like match heads struck by invisible hands." Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("quietly explosive, a filament bulb about to shatter") and occasional abstract phrasing ("empty spaces remember") prevent higher scoring. Template cadence in the "Tell them" sequence is pattern-taught and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of categorizing clouds by emotion offers a fresh angle on grief and memory. The specific synthesis of aviation meteorology with emotional archiving feels non-obvious. The risk of the lyrical mode and the protagonist's final step heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
