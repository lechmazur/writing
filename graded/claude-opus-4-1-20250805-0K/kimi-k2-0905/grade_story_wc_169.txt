I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as "logical dreamer" manifests concretely through her equation-making and methodical pattern work, with genuine internal contradiction between hope and despair. The blood-drop choice and equation articulation show agency with cost. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in emotional states ("serene upheaval") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira's departure into the tide with reset gauge forecloses the grotto's possibility while seeding future dreamers. The parallel timeline structure teaches its pattern early and pays off through the membrane meeting. Cost is legible in the "footprints already polished smooth" - erasure as price of transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto operates as active setting that breathes with Mira, provides materials (shells/kelp) that become memory maps, and enables the impossible balloon descent. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The final image of the grotto "conserving its light" for the next dreamer makes setting essential to closure's cyclical logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation reads through density increase and pattern intensification - from individual work to parallel-self recognition to collective seeding. The dominant stake of revitalizing consensus reality tightens when the equation releases into "the jet stream of collective thought." Minor dock for cost being more conceptual than visceral at peak moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the equation "Hope equals observed possibility plus observer's courage, divided by fear squared" and the final shell-message about watcher/watched. The recursive structure of dreamers across timelines creates non-literal resonance without moralizing. Strong integration of hope-as-altitude metaphor throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances scientific precision ("altitude gauge," "equations") with lyrical imagery ("silk the color of dawn before language"). POV control remains stable with clear perceptual signature. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("unopened mornings") that slightly exceeds Mira's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptions like "every shell a collapsed possibility." Deductions for two paraphrase loops ("logical dreamer" concept restated) and abstract phrasing in "serene upheaval" sections that could be more concrete. No artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific method with dream logic through "trial balloons" and hope equations offers fresh angle on familiar transcendence narrative. The parallel timeline structure and recursive ending avoid predictable resolution. Specific details like "brass needle quivering between realities" ground the fantastical premise.</comment>
