<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corin's internal conflict between commodification and meaning drives authentic choices, particularly his crushing of the pocket-sun. The "scientifically romantic" contradiction manifests in concrete attempts to quantify emotion versus the shell's spiral mathematics. Minor deduction for Mira's relatively thin characterization despite her pivotal role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through the shell's transformation from gift to question to shared presence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the crushed pocket-sun transforms their understanding without preserving the moment. Cost is felt in the deliberate destruction of Corin's creation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as micro-setting, its volcanic glass and glowing fissures creating tangible heat and light that shape the final transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"cooling magma" voice, glass that "sings." The setting constrains choice through its secret location they've protected.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Central tension between preservation and presence escalates through Corin's confession about "selling absence." The crushing of the pocket-sun represents meaningful deepening—destroying his life's work to create genuine shared presence. Cost is visible but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of capturing presence without killing it. The shell's transformation from "calcified heart" to carrier of "shared presence" offers a non-literal answer. Strong subtext in Mira's "deliberate accident" touch and whispered secret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with scientific-romantic tension reflected in syntax—technical terms alongside poetic imagery. Clean POV control throughout. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially Mira's "By returning differently" which both repeats and enacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("elastic as caramel," "ribbons that tied past to future") and occasional template phrasing ("tumbling out with urgency"). Information density is good but figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and emotional quantification creates original premise. The nautilus shell as "calcified heart" and pocket-suns as "compressed light without context" show specific imagination. Resolution through destruction rather than preservation subverts expected arc.</comment>
