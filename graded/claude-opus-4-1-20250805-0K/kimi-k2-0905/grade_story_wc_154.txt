<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between professional duty and human connection drives authentic choices, particularly in the act of "unknotting" the cast's messages despite the anesthetic blur. The child character applies immediate pressure through his "shrapnel-eyed" presence and directive to decode before "the dark eats the words." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("lotus-hearted ache") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's shift from carrying "shrapnel" to "sediment ready for new growth," with visible cost in the shared birthday and village mistranslation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of "translating footsteps into the quiet percussion of peace still possible." Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (atrium location emerges gradually) and some causality softness in how decoding leads to transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The field hospital setting with its "mist-clad atrium" and dripping leaves creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal states, particularly when "the world shrank to cot, coral, and child." The coral fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when aligned with the cast's spiral. Some generic descriptors ("watercolor grays") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translation-as-healing deepens through the revelation that the cast notes are "confession, a ledger of collective guilt," forcing the narrator to confront personal failure (mistranslated massacre). The morphine-altered state creates time pressure ("before the dark eats the words"). Cost is visible but escalation remains somewhat gentle for the stakes established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared trauma and collective memory emerges organically through the coral/reef metaphor and the act of "unknotting" confession into story. The final image of footsteps becoming "quiet percussion of peace still possible" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the child's few words and the smudged cast notes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through medical-poetic fusion ("anesthetic hummed through my veins like distant shelling") and translator's attention to language layers. Voice modulates effectively with morphine influence without losing coherence. The child's dialogue in "coastal dialect" creates authentic distinction. Minor repetition in descriptive patterns prevents 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent") and varied syntax support scene rhythm. Information density high in lines like "the coral had once hosted chromatic fish; now it hosted my sleeplessness." Some overwriting in figurative language ("lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep") and occasional template phrasing in transitions reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The conceit of reading trauma through cast graffiti offers fresh angle on war-zone healing narrative. Specific detail like "coordinates, names, half-erased prayers" and the coral-cast alignment creates particularity. Transformation of familiar medical/conflict elements feels organic but doesn't quite achieve breakthrough originality.</comment>
