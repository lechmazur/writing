<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with the anesthetic's disorienting effects and the "lotus-hearted ache" that opens outward. The boy's "shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent" presence creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some therapeutic articulation ("collective guilt," "shared anxieties") that could be more embodied, though the coral-touching moment and final transformation earn the high score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the narrator grafts new meaning through speaking knots aloud, transforming shrapnel into sediment. The orientation anchors clearly (field hospital, translator, twilight atrium). Cost is felt in the birthday transposition and village mistranslation. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution language ("sediment ready for new growth") that softens the visceral cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium's mist and dripping leaves constrain the world to "cot, coral, and child," creating intimate pressure. The coral fragment functions as micro-setting that shapes choices—the boy touches it through the shirt, it aligns with the spiral. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("watercolor grays") but the sensory hierarchy reflecting morphine-altered perception elevates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on decrypting the cast's notes as confession/ledger of guilt, with meaningful deepening when the narrator recognizes their own birthday and mistranslated village. The choice to voice each symbol carries cost in the "lotus-hearted ache" opening. Some abstractness in how "unknotting" transforms trauma weakens the visceral pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coral's transformation from hosting fish to hosting sleeplessness, then becoming lighter after shared with the boy. The final image of droplets as "quiet percussion of peace still possible" resonates without moralizing. Strong subtext in the cast's smudged notes as collective confession. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "reef memory" formulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with medical-poetic register ("anesthetic hummed like distant shelling," "palimpsest where trauma and translation overlapped"). Clean focalization through translator's morphine-softened perception. The boy's dialogue in coastal dialect adds texture. Strong perceptual signature in how the narrator processes the hospital through military metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent"). Some abstract formulations weaken momentum ("graft new meaning onto old wounds" appears twice; "shared anxieties" as concept). Minor synonym churn around the transformation metaphors. The sentence-level propulsion works best in concrete moments like the coral-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war translator encountering children's cast-notes as confession ledger. The coral fragment hosting sleeplessness instead of fish is inventive. The specific detail of mistranslating a village market into massacre adds authenticity. Some familiarity in the healing-through-connection arc prevents higher scoring.</comment>
