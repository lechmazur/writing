<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to save her daughter from forgetting sickness drives clear, escalating choices with embodied detail like "her voice cracking at first." The stakes intensify from personal need to cultural restoration, though some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("accumulated grief of a culture"). Internal contradiction plays well in the tension between preserving ancient knowledge and accepting modernity's cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the pollen release, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where forgetting becomes remembering. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The cost is felt in "the weight of centuries pressing against her chest" and the vine's sacrifice, though the ending's resolution feels slightly too complete for the established stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The verdant arbor functions as more than backdrop—branches serve as amplifiers, the hollowed oak workshop projects stories, and the vine tendril's golden ratio proportions constrain timing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("gathering hush pressed against her skin like silk"). The setting actively shapes Elara's choices through lunar timing and spatial choreography of her descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seventeen-year wait establishes clear stakes that tighten through the one-hour bloom window and exact timing requirements for pollen release. Cost is visible in the vine's withering and Elara's physical sensation of centuries' weight. However, the resolution's ease ("dozens of voices remembering") undercuts the established difficulty of recovering lost knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between "sacred practices" and "industrial progress," with the vine's pollen serving as both literal remedy and metaphor for cultural memory. The final image of new tendrils "already preparing for the next harvest moon" resonates without stating a moral. Some phrasing edges toward abstraction ("sophisticated systems for maintaining balance") but mostly stays grounded in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasional register drift appears ("sophisticated systems," "accumulated grief"). POV distance stays stable with clean focalization through Elara. The perceptual signature of noticing mathematical patterns and botanical details fits her tinkerer identity, though some sentences strain toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows ambition but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("moss-covered branch," "copper goggles reflecting," "verdant arbor"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("when harvest moon's descent, the vine tendril's awakening, and the forgotten songs' return"). Information density is high but sometimes obscures rather than clarifies the central action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical science with ancestral memory offers a non-obvious angle, particularly the idea that "harvest moon rituals weren't superstition but precise agricultural science encoded in dance." The concept of memory as contagion spreading through pollen is fresh. However, the resolution's tidiness and some stock elements (wise grandmother, dying child) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
