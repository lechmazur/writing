<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking meaning in silence drives him to the train and shapes his interaction with the halo fragment. His transformation from skeptic to believer occurs through embodied discovery (horses neighing in marrow, throat aching with swallowed words). The cost of his choice—walking away from his craft to follow ephemeral music—lands concretely in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery until the halo fragment creates a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands through Conceptual Repricing as the carpenter discovers "silence is not absence but an unopened mouth," with visible cost in abandoning his tools for intangible music. The orientation anchors (abandoned train, carpenter, search for fragment) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train functions as both setting and pressure system—its decay mirrors the carpenter's silent craft, while specific spaces (mirror corridor aging backward, overturned car with torn ceiling) constrain and enable his journey. The pool reflecting sky, vines as "green notes on a staff of starlight," and carousel horses breathing in "creaking timber" create a lived-in mystical world that directly shapes the discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in silence—escalates from physical search through the warped corridor's temporal distortion to the halo fragment's revelation. The carpenter's agency drives the search and transformation, though the fragment lifting "of its own accord" slightly weakens agency at the crucial moment. Cost accumulates through abandoned craft and the final choice to follow music over wood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of silence/sound, absence/presence, craft/art without explicit moralizing. The final revelation that "silence is not absence but an unopened mouth" reweights all prior imagery—wind bells, mute trapeze artist, silent carpenter—into a coherent meditation on unexpressed potential. The carousel horses' transformation from stillness to breath to music embodies the theme through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent mystical precision with distinctive phrases like "misting hush," "whispering gleam," and "unopened mouth." Perceptual signature strong—the carpenter notices through craft lens (sanding hands, cherry wood, brass poles). Purposeful compression and metaphoric density serve the accumulative design, though occasional purple moments ("staff of starlight") risk opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"His name was erased by choice, but the carousel horses remembered him" establishes character, history, and magical realism efficiently. Some metaphoric density borders on overwriting ("green notes on a staff of starlight"), and occasional abstract phrases ("interpreting the hush ahead as possibility") could be more concrete. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of circus decay, carousel craftsmanship, and mystical fragment creates a non-obvious meditation on artistic expression. The wrong turn leading to discovery, horses remembering through wooden nostrils, and the trapeze artist's frozen song offer fresh angles on familiar loss/transcendence themes. The ending's transformation of rails into musical staff stretching toward towns demonstrates committed vision.</comment>
