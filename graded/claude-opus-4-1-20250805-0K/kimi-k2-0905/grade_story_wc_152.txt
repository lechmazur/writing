I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the layered imagery, recursive phrasing, and pattern-based revelation structure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's contradictory impulses—preserving truth while performing foolishness—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her humming children's songs that name assassination targets. Her final choice to begin a new chart after preventing the coup demonstrates earned character continuity with visible cost (the risk she continues to bear).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered meanings (embroidery revealing conspiracy maps, nonsense songs naming targets) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where wisdom-disguised-as-foolishness rewrites the night. Cost is visible in the lieutenant's trembling hand and the "echoed silence" that replaces conspiracy, though the transformation feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices effectively—the projector's glass plate enables the reveal, the council chamber's acoustics carry her "quavering voice." The recurring "cobalt" and "autumn" create atmospheric coherence, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("stained-glass panes").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from stitching maps to encoding supply routes to the confrontation where "the fool was the only one who had truly listened." The pressure peaks when the lieutenant draws his pistol, with cost visible in the transformed plotters who "left the chamber changed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the wisdom/foolishness paradox and the concept of "unheard stories" between threads. The final image of stitching "quiet stars whose names no one had yet learned to fear" offers a non-literal answer about perpetual vigilance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("thread fibers crackling") and controlled psychic distance. The recursive phrasing ("flame from eternal candle," "echoed silence") creates textural coherence, though some constructions feel artificially elevated ("galaxy-chart embroiderer pressed").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Recursive phrases like "flame from eternal candle" and "echoed silence" create intentional pattern but occasionally slip into template cadence. The phrase "disguised wisdom as foolishness" appears three times with minimal variation, creating a loop effect that dulls momentum despite apparent thematic intent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of embroidery-as-espionage with hidden layers visible only by firelight offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of textile craft with conspiracy detection feels non-obvious, particularly the detail of reversed syllables naming targets.</comment>
