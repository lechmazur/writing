I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural drive lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's motivation is clear and consistent - using apparent foolishness to expose conspiracy while protecting the innocent. Her micro-choices (humming reversed names, timing her entrance, feigning senility) reveal values under pressure. Internal complexity shows in "synchronized her heartbeat to the echoed silence," though some repetitive phrasing ("disguised wisdom as foolishness" appears verbatim twice) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the embroiderer's hidden work transforms the conspiracy's outcome. The cost is visible - she risks death ("the lieutenant drew his pistol") and accepts ongoing vigilance ("there would always be more unheard stories"). However, the phrase "through adjacent possibilities" lacks clear mechanical grounding, and some repetitive constructions ("flame from eternal candle" appears identically three times) dilute impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choices - the dome's projection system enables the reveal, the council chamber provides the confrontation space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cobalt silk the exact shade of the observatory dome"). The autumn timing and pre-dawn hours create urgency, though some spatial transitions could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk to republic's survival, with clear tightening when "the lieutenant drew his pistol." The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate choices (timing, performance, revelation). Cost is legible - she accepts permanent vigilance and risk. The transformation of the conspirators ("carrying pieces of cloth") shows earned change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between apparent foolishness and hidden wisdom, between listening and speaking freely. The final image of continuing to stitch "quiet stars whose names no one had yet learned to fear" resonantly reweights the entire piece. Subtext operates throughout, particularly in the reversed syllables and hidden embroidery layer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("galaxy-chart embroiderer pressed her needle through cobalt silk"). Controlled psychic distance maintains mystery while revealing strategic interiority. However, exact phrase repetition ("flame from eternal candle," "disguised wisdom as foolishness," "echoed silence") creates template cadence that dulls momentum in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece effectively. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, repetitive phrase templates significantly impact score: "flame from eternal candle" (3x identical), "disguised wisdom as foolishness" (2x), "echoed silence" (3x), "adjacent possibilities" (3x), reducing variation and creating mechanical rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of espionage and traditional craft, with embroidery as intelligence work feeling inevitable rather than forced. The specific detail of reversed syllables naming doomed colonels shows originality. The quiet resolution through transformed understanding rather than violence offers a non-obvious angle on the coup narrative.</comment>
