<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The witness's transformation from detached cartographer to unified consciousness is earned through concrete spiral navigation and memory surrender. Internal contradiction appears as she walks "outward while remaining at the still center," though emotional embodiment remains abstract ("felt like mercy"). The final renunciation of individual identity for collective arbitration shows genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through spiral repetition, dictionary transformation, and library gyroscope imagery toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where witness becomes "pure notation." Cost appears in memory surrender and self-dissolution ("gentle puncture of self"). The hiccup frame and library setting anchor adequately, though spatial choreography occasionally blurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The temple library functions as both setting and mechanism, with shelves bowing "like accretion disks" and the spiral pattern constraining movement. Sensory detail appears selectively ("tasted of starlight and dust," "resounding hush"). The dictionary and spiral axis provide micro-setting that shapes the final transformation, though some descriptions remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern from initial palm-press through dictionary transformation, spiral navigation, memory surrender, to final self-dissolution. The witness actively chooses each deepening step, with cost visible in erasure of identity and memories sliding "down the curve." Stakes remain primarily internal/conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spiral's "quiet arbitration" between endings/beginnings, with the dictionary's shifting definitions and the witness/witnessed unity offering non-literal answers. The cosmic illusion revelation ("not that things end, but that endings are separate from beginnings") reweights prior material. Some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through cosmic-scale metaphors ("universe's hiccup," "accretion disks") and precise ritual counting. Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression and taught patterns (spiral repetition, paradoxical movement). No dialogue appears, avoiding potential voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density high with lines carrying multiple functions, though abstract diction occasionally obscures ("spiral arbitration," "centrifugal yearning equals centripetal truth"). Some template repetition appears ("She wandered...wanderingly exact"). Prose rhythm varies effectively between longer accumulative sentences and shorter declaratives at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic witness, library-as-consciousness, and spiral geometry creates fresh angle on dissolution narrative. The "journeying inward while walking out" paradox and dictionary-as-universe transformation show genuine invention. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens conceptual stakes while maintaining closure legibility.</comment>
