<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's contradiction between performing grief and authentic witness drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to preserve memory through "benevolent ruthlessness." The transformation from crisis actor to historian lands with visible cost in her acceptance of the "nomadic penumbra" identity. Minor deduction for Kestrel's underdeveloped arc despite his pivotal role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (walking as writing) that pays off in the shared final sentence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the "kingdom of small gestures" with clear cost—accepting permanent displacement. The who/where/when anchors effectively by ~100 words through "whispering gallery beneath the abandoned throne room."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as active setting that literally speaks back and demands action ("Record us"). Walking patterns that spell words transforms space into archive, making environment inseparable from action. The chessboard's missing pawns mirrors the city's absent commoners, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when Kestrel appears as potential threat, forcing Mara's choice between flight and connection. The meaningful tightening occurs through their chess-game negotiation that transforms opposition into alliance. Cost is visible in accepting permanent exile ("nomadic penumbra inside her").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the preservation of "small gestures" against historical erasure without moralizing. The lace noose on the white queen and missing pawns create layered meaning about power and absence. Final image of overlapping footsteps offers non-literal answer to memory's survival through collaborative witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines formal register with embodied specificity ("heel-toe-pause-toe-heel"). Perceptual signature shows in how Mara reads space as text and movement as archive. Minor compression in Kestrel's dialogue transition from threat to vulnerability could be smoother.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("nomadic penumbra drifting just outside the circles of lantern light"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition in walking patterns. Slight overwriting in metaphor density ("stone mouths shaping vowels of air that tasted like iron and lilac") without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Walking as writing and the "historian of small gestures" concept freshly synthesizes movement, memory, and resistance. The crisis actor becoming authentic witness through catastrophe transforms the trope meaningfully. Risk-taking in lyric density and pattern-based narrative heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
