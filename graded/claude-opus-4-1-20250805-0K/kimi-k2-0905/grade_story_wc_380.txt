I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through pattern, image accumulation, and a final resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mael's motivation to recover erased memories is embodied through concrete actions (reading coffee grounds, feeding the matchbook to stabilize the projection) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously when she reaches for her mother's figure knowing she cannot grasp it. The final choice to accept both recovery and loss ("pockets heavier with recollection yet body lighter") shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mael's recovered memory transforms into pigment bleeding into salt formations, establishing that deleted memories migrate rather than vanish. The cost is legible: she gains her name but loses the physical tokens (matchbook, flowers) that enabled recovery. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2-3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as micro-setting that enables the central action—gravity pockets allow the flowers to bloom and project the memory. Environmental details constrain choice (Mael must kneel at the lowest vat, wait for gravity surges) and the final image of crystallizing whale scales reweights the opening's "gleaming silence."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through accumulating sensory details until the gravity surge triggers the memory projection, forcing Mael to sacrifice her matchbook to stabilize the vision. The cost manifests physically (flowers crumble to pigment) and emotionally (embracing absence alongside recovery), though the single-beat resolution limits escalation depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor that deleted memories "migrate into whatever hollow is large enough to cradle them," avoiding explicit statement while the final image of Mael lighting lamps as "buoys marking where memory had surfaced" offers a non-literal answer about loss and recovery. The wildflowers' transformation into permanent pigment suggests memory persists through change rather than preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with selective perception ("salt-crusted eye reflected the lantern...a cold moon bobbing inside death") though some constructions edge toward overwriting. The perceptual signature stays distinct—Mael reads absence through physical patterns—but occasional template phrases ("gleaming silence answered") slightly dilute uniqueness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystals cracked, shedding shards that hovered, then rained upward") but suffers from occasional overwriting in figurative language ("gravity smiles—imperceptibly, everywhere at once"). Some synonym churn appears ("deleted"/"erased"/"redacted") and the final incomplete sentence creates unnecessary ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gravity pockets as containers for deleted memories offers a fresh synthesis of physics and psychology, while the specific method of reading absences through coffee ground patterns transforms a mundane practice. The transformation feels earned through accumulated detail rather than convenient invention.</comment>
