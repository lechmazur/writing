<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corin's transformation from meek to defiant is earned through concrete choices—bartering his hammer, descending alone, striking the gong—with contradictory impulses (fear vs. determination) embodied in action. The final renunciation of partial control shows clear cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic label-speak ("quietly determined") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Corin's resistance transforms both the planet's physical reality (arches now sing) and social order (citizens feel resilience). The causal chain from silk-barter through mural-projection to confrontation is tight. Cost is visible in the risk taken and the "interest" demanded on returned dreams.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inverted orchard world with floating arches and underground mines creates consistent pressure on choices—Corin must use forgotten tunnels specifically because the arches "might hear and fall." The mural's violet cords and the smelter chamber constrain the confrontation. Some occupational detail (gravity-oxen) enriches without overwhelming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal debt to planetary liberation, with the moonrise deadline creating urgency. The silk's transformation into a weapon and the arches' trembling response show clear tightening of options. The magicians' attempt to bargain for "partial control" demonstrates real cost in their yielding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience "coaxed from rubble" emerges through concrete imagery—slag that was swords, the mural tethering arches, citizens learning to forge their own luck. The silk's dissolution into stone creates resonant closure without stating a moral. Some thematic echo in "azure defiance" slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with selective perception (Corin notices weight, metal's recognition) that reflects his blacksmith expertise. Voice modulates from quiet observation to defiant action. Minor inconsistency in omniscient knowledge of what "magicians' collectors" are doing in tunnels before they arrive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong verbs ("slag sighed," "gong rolled"). Information density is high—most sentences advance plot and atmosphere simultaneously. Some template cadence in middle section ("Corin heard...He wrapped...He clanged") and occasional overwriting ("bruised-azure shadow") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and labor resistance ("workers declared they would no longer serve sky tyrants") with specific world-building (gravity-oxen, plex-citrus). The image of arches that sing instead of threaten and the silk that teaches stone to dream show genuine ingenuity beyond template fantasy.</comment>
