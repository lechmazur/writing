<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calyx's sleepwalking compulsion and bleeding optimism onto orchids creates genuine embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to dissolve the plate carries visible cost through the transformation of porcelain to shell. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic red") that approaches label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Calyx's weaving literally restores the tide through sacrifice of the illustration plate, with visible cost in his blood and the plate's dissolution. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the stitching sequence. Orientation anchors (canyon, labyrinth, dried harbor) establish clearly by line 3, though the worldbuilding logic of how weaving restores tides remains slightly opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth physically constrains Calyx's path ("seventh switchback the path crumbled") and the driftwood loom emerges from the canyon floor as essential infrastructure for the closure. Sensory hierarchy works well—orchid scent signals both death and renewal throughout. The canyon's agency ("stitching him forward") makes setting actively shape choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal unrest to cosmic restoration as Calyx's blood sacrifice transforms the plate and brings back the tide. The cost is legible in "pricked his own palm" and the plate's dissolution. However, the mechanism by which personal sacrifice restores an entire ecosystem lacks some causal clarity, keeping this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ending's image of orchids reflected in water offers a non-literal answer to broken precedents through transformation rather than restoration. "Every unraveling is only the first half of a weave" emerges from the concrete weaving action. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "ruin to reverence" framing that edges toward theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Calyx experiences the canyon as actively stitching him forward and reads petroglyphs as guidance. The lyric compression works ("threads crawling up the walls like ivy of light"). Some register elevation in phrases like "hauntingly optimistic" and "orchid solace" that don't fully match a weaver's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("walls shifting inches, granting passages"). However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("ruin to reverence," "what remains to what reveres") and some template cadence in the middle section ("Higher he climbed...There the fabric unfolded...") reduce momentum. The prose serves the lyric mode but occasionally tips into ornamental territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving as literal world-repair through personal sacrifice feels fresh and earned. The specific detail of orchids that "never grew in salt before" and the loom sinking beneath returning tide shows commitment to premise. Risk-taking in the magical realism pays off with coherent world logic.</comment>
