I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and biological/electrical metaphors toward a resonant transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mateo's motivation is crystalline—his terminal diagnosis drives the urgency to complete his interspecies bridge before death. The internal contradiction between his "dwindling pulse" and the orchard's "steady chord" creates authentic tension. His final choice to integrate himself into the circuit carries visible cost ("six-month horizon dissolved").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mateo closes the circuit through himself, transforming from architect to architecture. The cost is explicit: his physical dissolution into the network ("future and past became root and branch"). The accumulative structure builds through diary entries and wire installations toward this earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The temple orchard functions as both setting and mechanism—the living stone pillars that "bore tool marks inside their woody skin" constrain and enable Mateo's design. The copper wire network transforms space into instrument. The environment actively participates in the closure when "every node lit simultaneously."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through biological accumulation: first a sparrow makes the circuit sing, then geckos trigger light pulses, finally all creatures synchronize in "parliament." The tightening occurs when Mateo must choose between remaining observer or becoming participant—he chooses integration with clear physical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of colonial architecture into "multispecies collaboration." The final diary entry—"Architecture is only complete when it forgets the architect"—reweights all prior building metaphors. The story earns its wisdom through dramatized dissolution rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a botanical precision ("mycorrhiza," "basaltic fissures") that reflects Mateo's systematic nature while modulating into lyric registers ("moon silvered the stone"). The perceptual signature is distinct—filtering everything through biological/electrical metaphors. No head-hopping; clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high—most sentences carry both literal and metaphoric weight ("roots to clasp, compress, and ultimately reshape"). Minor repetition of "gently systematic" and some filter constructions ("Mateo felt," "he watched") prevent higher scoring. The final image lands with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of biological, electrical, and architectural systems into a living communication network is genuinely fresh. The concept of death as integration rather than ending transforms familiar material. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens stakes while maintaining clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
