I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's transformation from "inadvertently stubborn" refuser to willing keeper shows genuine internal contradiction acted out through concrete choices. His acceptance of tenure carries visible cost—being tethered by the brass tentacle—though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the underwater sequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the undertaker becomes the lighthouse keeper, with clear cost (permanent tethering, loss of mortal life). The accumulative pattern builds from fragment to summons to descent to transformation, each beat deepening the "address of rest" concept. Minor orientation wobble in the underwater city's initial description.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater library setting brilliantly constrains choices—books breathing underwater, salt pages becoming corridors, the brass octopus catalog directing movement. The broken lens and its repair mechanism directly shape the protagonist's actions. Environment and objects consistently pressure the narrative toward its resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal summons to collective soul-keeping responsibility. The escalation through discovering the library's purpose, understanding the lens's function, and accepting keepership shows clear accumulative pressure. Cost is visible in the tethering and permanent commitment, though middle beats could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ending powerfully reweights "rest has a permanent address" from abstraction to literal underwater library where souls check out toward eternity. The theme emerges through concrete imagery—paper boats of names, books sighing shut, the circulation desk—without moralizing. The final image of the empty parlor resonates backward perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression—"distress signals still flash where no surface light can reach" exemplifies the perceptual signature. Some moments of elevated diction ("chased stillness," "occupying impossible spaces") serve the dreamlike quality, though occasionally brush against purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "books breathing underwater" and "phosphorescent scars." However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("occupying impossible spaces" appears three times) and some filter-heavy passages in the middle section. The density of figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater library cataloging souls transforms the afterlife bureaucracy trope through specific detail—the brass octopus catalog, books as doorways, burning memory for light. The synthesis of undertaker-as-librarian feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking with the surreal elements heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
