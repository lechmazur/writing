<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's transformation from "inadvertently stubborn" refusal to accepting his role as eternal keeper shows clear motivation rooted in his connection to the dead, with embodied details like "hands trembled" and "salt on his lips." The final choice to accept tenure in exchange for perpetual calm carries visible cost—he becomes the drowned library's keeper, filing souls "under its proper star," though some emotional transitions (dream to conviction) feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the undertaker accepts eternal guardianship with clear cost—"his own name appearing on the last blank page." The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks (underwater fire burning on memory, books breathing) that reweight the dominant stake of giving rest "a permanent address," though the orientation of the underwater library's origin could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory world with "boulevards of barnacled marble," "brass octopus whose tentacles pointed toward stacks," and the underwater library constraining choices through its impossible physics. The setting directly shapes the resolution—the lens must be repaired from within this drowned space—though some transitions between physical states could be more precisely anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal summons through discovering the drowned library to accepting eternal guardianship, with the undertaker's agency driving key turns (pressing shard into bezel, burning paper boats of names). The cost is legible—he trades his mortal life to become the lighthouse keeper—though middle pressure could tighten further between discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the final image of the undertaker "filing every returned soul under its proper star," offering a non-literal answer about death's permanent address being "reachable if one is willing to descend." The recurring motif of "occupying impossible spaces" gains resonance as he becomes both "caretaker and cared-for," avoiding any explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("a morse of moonlit bubbles," "column of chased stillness") and consistent perceptual signature focused on death's textures. The prose maintains its dreamlike register through pressure without head-hopping, though occasional phrases like "maternal click" slightly strain the established tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "books breathing underwater" and "fire translated grief into light," but some template cadence appears ("He traveled...descended...followed," "He located...found...opened"). Minor redundancy in explaining the library's function reduces momentum, though the closing image lands with high density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-librarian with underwater gothic creates an original mythology where "the dead accumulated like overdue fines." The concept of a drowned library cataloging souls with "Perpetual Repose, Volume Infinity" shelved between "Nautical Star Charts" and "Lullabies for the Unborn" shows genuine imaginative risk that heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
