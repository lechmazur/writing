I'll evaluate this literary story according to the demanding standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation to reject comfort for truth drives consistent choices throughout, with concrete embodiment of isolation and purposeful ritual-making. The character's internal contradiction between preserving memory and refusing resurrection shows genuine complexity, though some philosophical passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("solitude teaches monologue").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure—the alchemist's refusal to resurrect the town carries visible cost through the solitary ritual of burning lanterns. The piece teaches its pattern early with the paper-lantern imagery and builds density through working memory as metaphor, though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove functions as both setting and constraint, with the abandoned town's artifacts (ledgers, telegraph office, flagpole) enabling the alchemist's ritual construction. The wire ribs "like whale bones in a desert" and the well "choked with shredded ledgers" create vivid specificity that charges the final image of reimagination through destruction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving authentic memory versus comfortable resurrection—escalates through the amber bottle's increasing hunger and the alchemist's ritual response. The refusal to open the bottle ("Comfort is the cork you offer; I reject it") forecloses resurrection with clear cost: eternal solitude in service of truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the working memory metaphor and the ritual of burning scrolls—"Civilization is the story we agree to remember imperfectly." The final image of teaching memories to fly through destruction offers a resonant, non-literal answer about collective memory without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with controlled lyric voice that modulates between philosophical reflection and concrete action. The alchemist's way of noticing filters through craft metaphors ("working memory is a retort"), though occasional academic register intrusions ("municipal bylaws for a council of none") slightly disrupt consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I walked beneath them, the last alchemist the town had bothered to name." Some template cadence appears mid-story ("I collected... I mixed... I inked...") and occasional abstract philosophizing dulls momentum, though the prose maintains clarity and the final image lands with power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The conceit of refusing resurrection in favor of perpetual reimagination through destruction offers genuine freshness, transforming the ghost town revival trope. The specific synthesis of alchemy, memory theory, and paper lanterns creates an inevitable-feeling logic, though some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>
