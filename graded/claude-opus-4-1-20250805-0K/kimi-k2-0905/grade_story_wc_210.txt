<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra's rejection of false comfort drives concrete choices throughout, from smashing the bottle to building through fragments rather than wishes. Her internal consistency holds through the renunciation of magic in favor of "working memory," though the supporting cast who arrive late lack comparable depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward communal revival, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the town transforms its medium of existence. Cost is visible in the ten-year exile and the smashed bottle's finality, though the truncated ending weakens full closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cove functions as active participant—lanterns inhaling, responding to the bell, rearranging the mandala—making setting inseparable from the story's logic. Sensory details like "copper and cinnamon" and "oyster-shell dust" are selective and POV-filtered, constraining choices through the town's emptiness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal exile to communal revival through Veyra's accumulated actions, with the bottle's smashing marking the decisive turn that enables others' return. The deepening occurs through textural accumulation fitting the lens, though the abrupt ending truncates the final cost demonstration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber bottle's refusal to open—rejecting wish-fulfillment for earned reconstruction—and the inverted blueprint showing futures instead of pasts. The final image of weaving light into thread and charting futures offers resonant answers without moralizing, though the truncation prevents full thematic crystallization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains literary density with controlled metaphor ("glowing jellyfish," "lungs" for plazas) and consistent psychic distance through Veyra's perception. Some passages edge toward overwriting ("distillate of human longing") but rhythm generally supports the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("salt-crusted skiff onto the splintered pier"). The abrupt truncation and some abstract phrasing ("memory is still at work here") create minor momentum issues without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a town changing its medium of existence and lanterns as sentient participants offers genuine freshness. The amber bottle that sealed itself and refuses comfort transforms the wish-granting trope, though some elements like the returning exiles feel more conventional.</comment>
