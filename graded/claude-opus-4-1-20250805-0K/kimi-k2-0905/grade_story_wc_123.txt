<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's meticulous nature and credible curiosity drive meaningful choices throughout, from waiting to watch the pigeon to choosing lateral movement over expected paths. Her decision to create a "lateral chain of integrity" shows internal conflict between official duty and truth, with visible cost in going underground. The "Ice traced her spine" moment effectively embodies fear, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("if she was being used as a conduit...").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through phosphorescent map discovery, backward-writing ritual, and rain tasting. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara moves from isolated recorder to underground truth-keeper, with clear cost in abandoning her surface life. The message dated tomorrow creates effective temporal pressure, though the quarantine zone's truth-containing function could be more gradually revealed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard-to-underground journey creates meaningful spatial pressure, with the maintenance shaft and phosphorescent lichen constraining movement and revealing hidden truth. Setting actively shapes choices through the gargoyle's eye panel and pigeon-accessible cracks. The "wet limestone and pigeon feathers" sensory detail grounds the descent, though the underground space could use more tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal integrity to systemic truth as Elara discovers the quarantine zone contains uncensored weather data. Her choice to stay underground and release contradictory data shows clear agency with visible cost. The pressure tightens effectively from being followed to discovering manipulation to choosing underground exile, though the follower's specific identity remains vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between official "gentle forecasts" and "raw screams of pressure and heat," with weather serving as metaphor for truth that "cannot be quarantined." The final image of tasting rain "unrecorded by any official gauge" resonates without stating a moral. The "lateral chain of integrity" concept effectively bridges personal and systemic themes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("wind shear to the third decimal") and lyrical moments ("sky bruised into violet"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("populated by every honest storm"). The prose effectively modulates between technical observation and emotional response.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the hush felt borrowed, as though someone had paused the world." Some density issues in expository passages ("inside it, instruments recorded uncensored weather, the raw screams..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting. The final sentence runs long but maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and underground resistance creates non-obvious angle on truth vs. propaganda. The carrier pigeon as living shuttle through unmapped circuits shows inventive world-building. Writing messages backward dated tomorrow demonstrates creative temporal play, though the concept edges toward familiar dystopian territory.</comment>
