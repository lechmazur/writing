<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aera's motivation to understand resilience drives consistent choices through discovery and integration. The contradictory impulse between seeking/receiving knowledge plays out concretely when she offers her memories to the sapling and receives calm in return. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution of "resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking" which edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it's earned through prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the gravity inversion sequence leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aera gains embodied understanding of resilience. The cost is visible when she offers her painful memories ("first crash, mother's final harvest, loneliness") to the collective. Orientation anchors (orchard pilot, skiff, planet, gravity inversion) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inverted gravity environment directly constrains navigation ("boots skating across leaves that now served as stepping-stones") and the arrow tip's acceleration of growth cycles shapes the discovery sequence. Water flows that "ribbon the air like music scores" provide navigation method tied to setting. The Silent Core's "cathedral of unheard choir" charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (understanding resilience's source) tightens through the gravity inversion creating time pressure and the arrow's acceleration revealing "countless generations running their survival dance at lightspeed." Cost manifests when Aera surrenders her memories and receives understanding that "giving and taking are the same motion." The escalation follows the Accumulative lens through layered sensory discoveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transfer of endurance across voices and generations without explicit moralizing until the near-end. The sapling as "prism of every hardship outlived" offers a non-literal answer through image. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract articulation "resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking" though it's integrated with the trees' responsive blossoming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through navigation metaphors ("irrigation streams...like music scores") and lyrical compression ("frost laughter, pest indifference"). POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Aera. Voice modulates effectively during the gravity inversion sequence with shorter, more immediate syntax matching the urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in the gravity inversion sequence. Some figurative density in peak beats ("cathedral of unheard choir," "prism of every hardship") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("She reached...She descended...She logged") though it doesn't pervade. Clear propulsion through the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of resilience as collective memory transfer offers a fresh angle on survival narrative. The gravity inversion as discovery mechanism and water-flow navigation create specific world logic. The arrow transforming from broken artifact to "living wood" provides concrete transformation of the abstract concept.</comment>
