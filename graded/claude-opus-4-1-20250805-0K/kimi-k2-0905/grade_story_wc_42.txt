<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's contradiction between attachment and letting go drives the closure with visible cost. The "luminous ache" becomes embodied through concrete actions (pressing thumb to lens, walking curved corridors). However, some emotional states lean abstract ("changelessly constant in her orbit") and the secondary pressure from the leaf remains conceptually vague rather than dramatically urgent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's departure transforms the observatory into a photograph, with clear cost (losing her home of thirty years). The pattern of camera/time/ephemeral imagery coheres toward the final image. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "ephemeral" concept that doesn't fully concretize until late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting constrains choices effectively (airlock, vacuum, specific instruments). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silver halide memories peeling like old paint"). The impossible leaf creates productive tension with the vacuum setting. Minor deduction for some abstract spatial descriptions ("corridors that now angled like light through prism glass").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vs. leaving the observatory) builds through accumulating pressure—the shaking, the spinning clock hand, the impossible leaf. The closure choice to photograph and leave carries visible cost. The escalation through textural density works under the Accumulative lens, though the "ephemeral" remains somewhat abstract as an antagonistic force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the photography/time/memory complex without explicit statement. The final image of the observatory becoming its own photograph while Mira carries only the negative resonates deeply. The mentor's advice about restructuring yourself rather than the machine pays off perfectly at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("luminous ache," "origami of steel and glass"). POV remains stable with clean focalization throughout. Some register elevation in peak moments ("changelessly constant," "escape velocity") slightly exceeds Mira's established lexicon but serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful compression ("the observatory exhaled, bulkheads flexing like diaphragm blades"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("the upward rush of time finally loosed") and some template cadence in the middle third ("She understood... She walked... She set...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera/observatory/time concepts with the impossible leaf as surreal anchor. The transformation of the observatory into a photograph is genuinely inventive. The piece commits fully to its lyric-surreal premise without retreat, taking risks with abstract concepts that mostly pay off at closure.</comment>
