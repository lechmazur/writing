I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric repetition and image accumulation toward a resonant transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal consistency holds through contradictory impulses—attachment to the observatory versus necessity of leaving—culminating in her choice to "let go the instant you capture it." The embodied "luminous ache" and physical sensations ground her emotional arc. Minor deduction for some abstraction in peak moments ("ephemeral" remains conceptual rather than fully embodied).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's departure transforms the observatory into a photograph, with visible cost (30 years of life collapsed into a single frame). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated images (luminous ache, sound of falling leaf, clock hand) that reweight at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the textural logic holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting constrains choices effectively—the shaking foundations force Mira's decision, and specific details (telescope mirrors on shuttle hull, lunar dust as lubricant) feel lived-in. The impossible leaf creates productive tension with the vacuum setting. Doesn't quite reach higher bands as the environment could pressure tactics more directly in middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: trembling floor → spinning clock hand accelerating → observatory exhaling → final collapse. The dominant stake (preserving versus releasing) tightens when Mira must choose between staying with her life's work or escaping. Cost is visible in the 30-year investment abandoned and the observatory's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the photography metaphor—time as aperture, the observatory as darkroom developing "the negative of her own leaving." The final realization that "the ephemeral had harnessed her just enough to set her free" offers resonant closure without moralizing. The recurring "luminous ache" transforms from pain to "something softer," earning its thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"changelessly constant in her orbit," "origami of steel and glass." The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering the surreal through technical camera/observatory language. Some register elevation in peak moments ("ephemeral," "guillotine") but largely maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The lens faced inward, toward the heart of the station" works literally and metaphorically. Some repetition serves the accumulative pattern ("luminous ache" appears 4 times) but "changelessly constant" variations feel slightly mechanical. Information density high but occasional abstraction ("harness the ephemeral") reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of camera repair expertise with cosmic/temporal stakes feels fresh—treating time as a photographic process. The impossible leaf in vacuum as countdown mechanism shows creative risk-taking. The ending image of the observatory becoming its own photograph offers a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
