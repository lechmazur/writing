I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's internal conflict between duty and conscience drives meaningful choices with visible cost. Her contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene (preserving vs exposing), and the final choice to release the truths then re-enter cryo carries earned consequences. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("bravely conflicted") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Sera's action transforms the library from "tomb" to "cradle," with visible cost (potential burning, mob violence). The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors establish who/where/when early. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the council's response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively constrains choices (narrow maintenance shaft, copper wires, cryo-pod timing) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("exhalations became falling snow that melted on live copper"). The snow/ice motif reinforces thematic tension between preservation and revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake (preserving truth vs institutional loyalty) with meaningful escalation through Sera's choice to upload the contraband. The cost is legible—potential destruction of the archive she loves, her own re-freezing. One decisive tightening occurs when she commits to the upload despite knowing the consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and revelation, with the final image of library as "cradle" offering a non-literal answer. The "half ice, half fire" reflection and the promise to burn with the books if necessary shows thematic complexity without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively through images rather than statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity ("dizzying quiet" shifts to active urgency during the upload sequence). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("liaison letter glowing") but generally serves the archival setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in places ("live coal in the sub-zero gloom"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor issues with occasional overwriting and one instance of somewhat purple phrasing, but clarity at closure remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of a cryogenic archivist discovering censored truths offers a fresh angle on the whistleblower narrative. The specific synthesis of preservation duty with truth-telling, and the choice to return to cryo after releasing the information, feels both surprising and inevitable. The frozen library as both tomb and cradle is particularly effective.</comment>
