<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's internal conflict between duty and conscience drives genuine tension through embodied reactions ("pulse drummed louder than the ventilation fans") and culminates in a costly choice with clear stakes. The "bravely conflicted" attribute manifests through concrete actions rather than labels, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("archivist and anarchist fused").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from awakening to transmission to re-freezing, with Sera's choice creating irreversible consequences ("the conversation would no longer be unspoken"). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—the library may burn, but truth is released. The orientation anchors arrive clearly (archivist, frozen library, thawing system), though the worldbuilding occasionally relies on compressed exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively constrains choices through narrow maintenance shafts, dormant networks, and the constant threat of re-freezing. Sensory details like "exhalations became falling snow that melted on live copper, hissing like distant applause" create atmosphere while advancing action. The snow-buried archive functions as both obstacle and metaphor, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("silent aurora").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal discovery to societal upheaval through Sera's agency, with the ticking clock of potential re-freezing creating urgency. The cost is explicit: "the library would either stand reborn or fall purified by flame." One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera commits to uploading despite knowing the consequences, though the resolution's scope (city-wide revelation) feels slightly rushed for the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus control emerges through concrete actions—hidden networks, frozen memories, censored archives—rather than statements. The final image of the library as "no longer a tomb but a cradle" reweights the opening's "dizzying quiet" without moralizing. Some thematic articulation edges toward explicit ("without honest memory, no future generation could choose wisely"), but complexity remains through the acknowledged cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The close third-person maintains consistent access to Sera's interiority with distinctive perception ("each glass column humming with dormant networks of data veins"). Prose rhythm accelerates during action sequences and slows for reflection, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("anarchist and archivist fused"). The voice holds its texture through pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "hissing like distant applause" and "a woman half ice, half fire" demonstrate control, but template patterns emerge ("She remembered why," "She reached," "She slipped"). Several metaphors strain credibility ("each line a live coal in the sub-zero gloom"), and some passages loop concepts ("dizzying quiet deepened... dizzying quiet returned"). The prose achieves momentum but lacks the precision for higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a cryogenic archivist discovering censored truths offers a fresh angle on surveillance dystopia, with specific details like "dormant networks the council believed permanently disconnected." The moral complexity of potentially destroying the archive she loves adds depth. However, the setup follows familiar whistleblower templates without fully transforming them through lived detail.</comment>
