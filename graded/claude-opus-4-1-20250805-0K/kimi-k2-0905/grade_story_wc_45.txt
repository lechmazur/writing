<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with Elara's tactile engagement (turning the tooth, tasting chalk and thunder) and her transformation from "forgiving skeptic" to one whose "cleft in certainty widen[s] into a door." The changeling demonstrates shrewd agency through its calculated reveal. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hearts a map of bright fractures") in resolution beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increasing through garden transformation and constellation imagery, landing on Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts fractured certainty as strength. Cost is visible in her kneeling submission and acceptance of errors. Orientation anchors are delayed (character clear, but setting/situation emerges gradually) without serving closure, triggering -0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as transformative space with hedge maze reweaving and sundial marking judgment hour. Sensory detail strong ("bruised mint and iron," "damp hem drinking dew"). Capped at 7.0 due to orientation penalty in Q2; garden's physical logic occasionally unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on epistemological crisis—how to reconcile error with authority—deepening through changeling's invitation to "set bones" of mistakes. The transformation from skeptic to teacher who embraces "bright fractures" shows meaningful cost. Escalation through accumulation rather than reversal fits the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bone-setting metaphor: "not to erase the break, but to let the limb grow stronger at the angle of its wounding." The constellation map of missteps and final image of children learning from the "forgiving skeptic" resist tidy morals while offering resonant wisdom about error and growth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("turning the changeling's baby tooth between her fingers like a dim star"). Clean focalization through Elara with purposeful compression. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("every mistake is a seed, every seed wants a sky") fits the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("heart a map of bright fractures"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy, and density that occasionally obscures action clarity. Information density high but sometimes at clarity's expense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with epistemological crisis creates non-obvious angle. The bone-setting as metaphor for mistake-integration feels earned and specific. Risk-taking in lyrical density and conceptual focus over traditional plot heightens thematic stakes without losing coherence.</comment>
