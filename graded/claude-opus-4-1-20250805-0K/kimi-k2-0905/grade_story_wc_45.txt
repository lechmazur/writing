I'll evaluate this story systematically under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density toward a conceptual repricing of mistakes as sources of strength.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from "forgiving skeptic" to one who teaches that "every mistake, honestly honored, becomes a lantern" shows clear character arc with embodied details like "turning the changeling's baby tooth between her fingers like a dim star." The changeling character particularly excels with its "shrewdly innocent" paradox enacted through concrete actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("cleft in certainty") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's final understanding that mistakes should be "set...as you once set bones: not to erase the break, but to let the limb grow stronger at the angle of its wounding" fundamentally reweights the entire premise. The cost is visible in her transformation and the village's changed understanding. The accumulative structure coheres well with returning images (bone-setting, constellation, tooth) building toward the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret garden setting actively shapes the narrative through specific details like "pavers formed from the identical bones she had once aligned" and the "sundial carved from a vertebra." The hedge maze's transformation at the end ("every hedge rewove itself into a clearer labyrinth") participates in closure. Some passages lean abstract, missing opportunities for more tactile grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to reconcile harmful mistakes with healing—escalates through Elara's encounter with the changeling and culminates in her acceptance of "bright fractures guiding her like north stars." The tension between truth and beneficial lies creates genuine pressure. Slightly limited by the reflective mode which sometimes dampens immediate dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional thematic integration where the bone-setting metaphor organically develops the central question of whether mistakes can become sources of strength. The final image of Elara as someone whose "heart a map of bright fractures" guides others achieves resonance without stating a moral. The changeling's paradox of being both fraud and salvation embodies the theme perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism evident in phrases like "turning the changeling's baby tooth between her fingers like a dim star" and "the garden answered with a rustle." The prose maintains consistent register and the changeling's dialogue ("every mistake is a seed, every seed wants a sky") feels appropriately otherworldly. Some passages edge toward purple prose but remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "hedges humming with nostalgic innovation" and good syntactic variety. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("cleft in certainty," "nostalgic innovation") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density reduce clarity. The line "Years later children would play beneath those pears" shifts to summary mode, weakening immediate scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central conceit of mistakes as constellations to be "set" like bones offers genuine freshness, transforming the familiar changeling myth through specific medical practice. The paradox of beneficial fraud adds complexity. The resolution avoids tidy morality, embracing the idea that some breaks make us "stronger at the angle of [our] wounding."</comment>
