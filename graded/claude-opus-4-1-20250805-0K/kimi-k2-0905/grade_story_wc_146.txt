<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation through loss (his broken bell) and patient dedication drives meaningful choices, particularly his self-sacrifice at closure. The transformation from physical tuner to "tenth bell" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("hollow inside his chest") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian becomes the tenth bell, with clear cost (his transparency/dissolution). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through ritual repetition toward transformation. Orientation anchors early and the mythic logic remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables the restoration—the archway keystone becomes instrumental, cobblestones hold memory, the north ward's resistance reveals buried guilt. Rich sensory work through vibration, pressure, and the "way moonlight tastes." The bellflowers sprouting from black sand effectively merge setting with transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the ritual's seven circuits building toward transformation, with the north ward's resistance creating genuine obstacle. Elian's sacrifice of his heartbeat rhythm to complete the restoration shows clear agency and cost. The piece earns its resolution through accumulated pressure rather than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concept of "shared balance" requiring personal sacrifice—Elian must give "the piece of himself that matched what the place had lost." The final image of him as the tenth bell, maintaining balance through eternal vigilance, resonates without stating a moral. The bellflowers containing his heartbeat create layered meaning about restoration's price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register and strong perceptual signature ("ghost town's silence...coiling through sagging roofs"). Excellent rhythmic control, particularly in the ritual sequences. POV remains stable with clean focalization throughout. Minor moments of elevated diction ("infinitely patient") fit the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sentence variety and propulsive rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Some overwriting in figurative language ("silence...like smoke that had forgotten how to rise") and occasional abstract phrasing ("vacuum begging to be filled"). Information density generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The final sentence runs long but maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell-tuning as place-healing through embodied memory and rhythm. The concept of Tempris and towns having "bones" to retune offers original angle on restoration narrative. Elian's transformation into architectural element rather than simple success elevates beyond template. Specific details like "pilgrims who carried bells...to keep demons asleep" create memorable texture.</comment>
