<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim's transformation from seeker to carrier of magnified perception is earned through concrete cost—the clairvoyant's sacrifice of her gift. The parallel devolution of the seer into "mineral song" while he gains her sight creates genuine stakes. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("steadily unpredictable rhythm") that could be more embodied, though the treble clef scar and physical dissolution of the pearl ground the change effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the pilgrim receives transformative sight while the clairvoyant pays with her humanity, crystallizing into the cave itself. The cost is unmistakable—"voice eroding into mineral song" and the vanished entrance seal the irreversibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the transfer scene, though the final park scene slightly dilutes the immediate impact of her sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave functions as more than setting—its "glassy arpeggios" and dimensional crystals actively shape the magic system and constrain the transaction. The cave pearl's warmth "remembering the mollusk's heartbeat" provides visceral specificity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance through corridors to the still lake, though some descriptions ("bright darkness") lean abstract rather than sensory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—gaining sight at another's cost—escalates from rumor to irreversible exchange. The seer's staggering backward with "vision fracturing into kaleidoscopic warnings" shows genuine consequence. However, the pilgrim's attempt to "return the gift" feels gestural rather than a genuine reversal opportunity, and the years-later coda disperses some of the central tension's force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of a clairvoyant blind to her own future and the cost of transferring vision. The final image of children drawn to his humming while the cave "sings inside him" resonates without stating a moral. The insight that "clairvoyance is not seeing everything but recognizing the miracle you didn't see coming" feels earned through the dramatized exchange rather than imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains a mythic register appropriate to the fable-like premise, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "hair white as salt petals." Some passages drift into abstraction ("overlapping shadows cast from crystals that existed in more than three dimensions") that strain clarity. The seer's dialogue feels suitably oracular, though the pilgrim lacks distinctive speech patterns beyond silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("stalactites dripped luminous water that never disturbed the surface") but suffers from repetitive use of "steadily unpredictable" (3x) and abstract constructions like "bright darkness" (4x) that become refrains without deepening. Several sentences attempt too much simultaneous work, creating density that obscures rather than enriches, particularly in the dimensional crystal passage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit of a clairvoyant who cannot see her own fate offers genuine freshness, especially when coupled with the cave as living memory. The transformation of everyday magic through transferred sight avoids easy resolution. The specific cost—one person becoming mineral while another carries amplified perception into the mundane world—resists template endings.</comment>
