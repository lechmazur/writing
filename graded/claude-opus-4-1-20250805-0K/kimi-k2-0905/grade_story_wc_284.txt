<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spy's internal conflict between past paralysis and "prudently daring" action drives credible choices, with embodied details like "scarred nerves" and the bleeding knee showing cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("there was nothing left to lose") rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure with the transmission completing his arc from silence to confession, destroying himself "a second time" with visible cost. The Earned Stasis ending ("he had finally gone to meet it") lands with felt weight through the accumulated snow imagery and the snowdrop's persistence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bluff's physical constraints (buried station, frostbitten briars, wind-turbine power) directly shape the spy's tactics. The snowdrop emerging through slate becomes a charged final image of "unused courage," though some setting details remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal redemption to exposing the director's betrayal of four teams, with the transmission as irreversible action. The cost lands through crushing the pillbox—destroying his last connection to Sera—and accepting whatever consequences follow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The snowdrop-as-receiver metaphor and "gardeners of possible futures" organically develop the courage/fixing theme without stating morals. The final image of signal traveling "snow-soft and relentless" resonantly answers where unused courage waits through concrete action rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with selective details like "silver hush" and "teeth" in the air, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("prudently daring," "vouchsafed"). Clean focalization throughout with purposeful rhythm shifts under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong momentum with varied syntax, though some overwriting appears ("silver dust glinting like frost in his wake"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("He thought...He pressed...He expected") deducts -0.4, but the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The micro-code breathing technique and snow-coded coordinates offer fresh tradecraft details. The burned spy carrying proof of betrayal while seeking redemption transforms familiar espionage tropes through specific emotional cost and the snowdrop metaphor.</comment>
