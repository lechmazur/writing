<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's methodical nature and steady pulse while working create a consistent character, with her motivation clearly rooted in restoring balance between seeds and rain. Her micro-choices (building monuments, speaking "Reciprocity") carry visible cost and alter the world's state. The internal consistency holds throughout, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("mossy delight curling around her ribs").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the naming of "Reciprocity" as the decisive change that transforms the arbor and brings rain. Closure lands with visible cost (the drought-breaking rain with "nettle and iron" taste) and the covenant restored. The pattern of leaf-reading accumulates pressure effectively, though the transformation feels slightly rapid for the buildup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor functions as both setting and constraint, forcing Mireya to work against time as it drifts toward the cloudline. Sensory details ("ashen bark exhaled cold soot that tasted of old thunder") are vivid and selective. The environment directly shapes choices—the floating tree's movement creates urgency, and its transformation at closure ("branches that no longer cracked but bent like welcoming elbows") charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the folklore before the arbor rises above the cloudline—creates clear time pressure that tightens as "the arbor creaked, drifting higher." The resolution is earned through Mireya's systematic work and final utterance, with visible cost in the transformation of land and memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding floods her and she names the forgotten thing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity between humans and land emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the monuments to forgotten things embodying memory's relationship to renewal. The final image of seeds carrying "moonstone gleam" and soil sighing "I know you" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the covenant's restoration and the transformation of weeds back to healing herbs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct mythic-lyrical voice with controlled compression ("the hush where past meets prophecy thickened like fog between seasons"). Perceptual signature is strong—Mireya notices through a seed-sorter's methodical lens. No head-hopping occurs, and the purposeful elevated register serves the folkloric tone throughout without breaking character perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("She emptied a pouch of moonstone cabochon dust speck—scraps left from the midwife's legend"). Prose propels through varied syntax without loops or scaffolding. Some figurative density in emotional beats ("mossy delight curling around her ribs") approaches overwriting but doesn't obscure causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of folkloric elements with environmental restoration offers a non-obvious angle, with the skyborne tree as deed-holder of forgotten covenant being particularly fresh. The specific detail of building tiny monuments to forgotten things as a method of preserving folklore transforms the expected treasure-hunt narrative. Risk-taking in the elevated mythic register heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
