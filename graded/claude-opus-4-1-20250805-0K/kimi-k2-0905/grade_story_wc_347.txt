I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain where Mara's actions directly enable the travelers' escape.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied tension through physical details like "clenched a small nut" and "knees popping," with Mara's motivation rooted in duty rather than love creating authentic complexity. The constraint of being unable to enter the labyrinth forces creative problem-solving that reveals character through action. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "graceless beauty" formulation appearing twice without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from Mara's inability to enter → warm impressions → travelers noticing → escape, with the nut's blueprint providing crucial navigation knowledge. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("the long walk back to the orchard that kept her prisoner"). The time constraint and mechanical birds create persistent pressure that shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as constraint - the cliff edge, forbidden stones, and frost deadline all directly shape Mara's available actions. The "warm-ghosts" and "crystal fossils" create vivid, specific imagery that serves the plot. The mechanical birds' "lens-eye whirring" and "gears singing a lullaby of grinding teeth" achieve both atmosphere and active threat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the tightening frost deadline and the travelers' wrong turn toward "deceptive moonlight," forcing Mara to innovate with the nut-kernel solution. The cost is visible in Mara's physical toll and her perpetual imprisonment. Slight deduction as the middle section could have one more turn where Mara's method nearly fails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between imprisonment and freedom, duty without love, and "graceless beauty" of thankless service. The final image of Mara returning to her prison while others go free resonates without stating a moral. The nut as both gift and tool deepens the mother-daughter connection to the broader theme of inherited burdens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive constructions like "frost-brittle grass" and "warmth-ghosts," maintaining consistency throughout. POV control is excellent - we never slip into the travelers' heads or gain knowledge Mara doesn't have. The prose rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the time-pressure sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with high information density - nearly every line advances plot, atmosphere, or character simultaneously. Strong verb choices throughout ("hissed," "spewed," "banked"). No loops or scaffolding, though "graceless beauty" appears twice identically when variation might have enriched the echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fairy-tale curse with mechanical/steampunk elements creates an original world. The specific constraint of helping without touching is inventive and drives unique problem-solving. The "warm impressions" method and microscopic blueprint on the nut shell show genuine imagination. Risk-taking in the blend of genres pays off (+0.3).</comment>
