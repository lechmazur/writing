I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist's buried talents unfurl.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between self-protection through mercury glass and the need for belonging drives authentic choices. The final realization that "Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary" crystallizes earned character growth through embodied struggle, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing ("the talent for making homes was too dangerous to keep").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist's buried talents unfurl when she accepts that home requires necessity over safety, with visible cost in the cracking mercury glass. However, the incomplete final sentence ("unfurl like") undermines closure impact, and some causality relies on abstract concept-work rather than dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore as living architecture that responds to the protagonist's talents creates meaningful constraint. The mercury glass coating and the feather's ability to write truth on skin provide tactile specificity that shapes the final transformation, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("air tasted of copper and storm").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen as the protagonist moves from avoiding painful memories to actively seeding truth back into herself despite terror. The feather writing on mercury glass creates tangible risk with visible cost in the glass cracking away, though the middle section's exposition about buried talents dilutes present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of home as necessity rather than safety emerges organically through the protagonist's journey from self-protection to accepting her talent for creating belonging. The bookstore itself embodies this theme as "a home for homeless stories," and the final image of talents unfurling resonates without moralizing, despite the explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive mythic register with controlled imagery ("mercury-glass seer," "after-images of every reader"), though some passages drift into elevated abstraction. POV remains stable with consistent focalization, but perceptual signature could be more character-specific during key moments of transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While individual sentences show craft ("The mercury-glass seer pressed her mirrored palms"), the prose suffers from density issues with abstract concepts stacked without breathing room. The incomplete final sentence is a critical flaw, and several passages loop through synonymous descriptions of buried talents and home-making abilities.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mercury-glass coating as both protection and prison offers a fresh angle on trauma and healing. The concept of a bookstore grown from the talent to seed spaces with intention shows originality, though execution sometimes favors abstract philosophizing over lived specificity.</comment>
