<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seer's contradictory impulses—needing to reclaim her talents while knowing they brought harm—act simultaneously throughout, with her final renunciation of replanting gifts carrying visible cost ("mercury-glass skin catching the rising sun, no oracle now"). Minor deduction for some expository interiority mid-story that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the labyrinth journey, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from seer to "just a woman going home," with clear cost (losing her prophetic identity forever). The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~100 words, and the closure lands with the stone seeding "possibility that memory could belong to everyone."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore inside the mountain effectively constrains choices through its shifting corridors and the custodian's reality-rearranging powers. The crow feather functions as micro-setting that guides navigation and reveals hidden properties. Deduction for some abstract descriptors ("bottled grief") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming home's true shape versus being trapped in the custodian's cage) escalates through the exchange demand and her choice to shatter her talents rather than replant them. The cost is legible when she "set the stone on the ground...sealing her buried talents forever." Minor friction from the somewhat abstract nature of the custodian threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between individual power and communal freedom, crystallizing in her choice to let "memory belong to everyone, not seer nor soldier." The recurring crow feather and mercury-glass imagery charge the final transformation. Some mid-story reflection edges toward explicit ("Memory hurt because...") but recovers through the concrete final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic descriptions ("smelling of wet paper and thunder") and the seer's unique way of reading through touch. Some register drift into elevated diction ("Onomasticon," "cataract of burning alphabets") that occasionally strains against the established voice. The custodian's dialogue feels appropriately otherworldly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("bottled grief," "dormant gift") and some synonym churn around memory/remembering reduce clarity. The prose artifact of "mercury-glass" repetition works thematically but creates slight redundancy. Strong opening and closing lines partially offset these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a bookstore that physically contains buried talents and can trap visitors through reality-rearrangement offers fresh synthesis. The specific detail of using a funeral pyre feather to navigate by texture transforms familiar quest elements. The ending's renunciation of power for communal memory avoids expected triumph.</comment>
