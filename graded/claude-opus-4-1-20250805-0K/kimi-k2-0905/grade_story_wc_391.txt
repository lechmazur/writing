<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's internal contradiction between impatience and cultivated patience drives authentic tension through embodied details ("second heart rattling its cage"). The transformation from raw impatience to "smooth, dark stone he could carry" shows earned change through specific struggle, though some passages lean toward abstraction ("vigilant horizon mapper" feels labeled rather than lived).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure where moon-tracking accumulates to trigger the magnetic disruption. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as Elian kneels on ice, leaving his compass as offering while villages signal revolution. The "coast that would already be waking different" shows genuine consequence, though the exact mechanism of change could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables action—the frozen lake provides the recording surface, the viaduct's magnetic field becomes the revolution's trigger mechanism, and basalt sanctuary grounds the waiting. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's professional focus on magnetic fields and moon paths. The ice as "unwritten page" and viaduct as "half bridge, half antenna" integrate beautifully with function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulating observations toward the precise moment when "magnetic field would buckle trains, blackout relay towers." The seventh night's three-degree shift provides concrete escalation. Cost appears in Elian's sacrifice of his compass and transformation of impatience, though the revolution's broader stakes remain somewhat abstract beyond infrastructure disruption.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between patience and revolutionary timing—"revolutions guided by horizon mappers fail if launched a breath too soon." The final image of leaving the compass on ice while walking toward a changed coast offers resonant non-literal answer about sacrifice and precision in change. Some passages edge toward explicit statement ("revolution begins as a pattern you almost ignore").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Elian's specialized attention to magnetic fields, moon ricochets, and "polarity shifts he had learned to read like breath." Prose rhythm modulates effectively from meditative observation to the climactic spark-fall. Some elevated diction ("vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness") occasionally feels imposed rather than organic to voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the moon's single silver eye" establishes setting, tone, and isolation simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully between long observational passages and short declarative moments. Some abstract phrasing ("sculpt patience from impatience") and occasional register elevation detract, though the prose generally maintains strong momentum toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of mapping celestial/magnetic patterns to time revolution offers fresh angle on familiar revolutionary narrative. Specific details like "polarity tug at the iron in his blood" and blue sparks as "reverse snowfall" create memorable texture. The role of "horizon mapper" as revolution's timekeeper is inventive, though some elements feel slightly familiar in revolutionary fiction.</comment>
