I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where collaborative resistance transforms isolation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lark's monthly molting creates a compelling internal contradiction between cynicism and renewal, with the physical transformation embodying psychological change. The relationship with Marin develops through concrete micro-choices (sharing the coffee tin, building the spiral nest) that reveal shifting values. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("beauty from anarchy") that could be more embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "Co-conspirator of light" crystallizes the transformation from solitary resistance to collaborative rebuilding, with clear cost (risking exposure, burning past selves). The accumulative structure builds through ritual molting → unexpected connection → collaborative action → transformed identity. The orientation anchors (moon, library, prison setting) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as both setting and metaphor, with "iron dust," "buckled roof," and "warped stacks" creating tactile decay that mirrors internal states. The coffee tin's false bottom, paper cranes nested in dictionaries, and the spiral reading nest all constrain choices and enable specific actions. The final image of the library growing "too bright for iron walls to hold" charges the closure with earned transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: private ritual → unexpected human connection → collaborative risk → confrontation with authority → sealed commitment. The dominant stake (preserving transformative space against institutional erasure) tightens when Rourke arrives, forcing immediate tactical adaptation. Cost is visible in burning past selves and risking exposure of the contraband system.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of molting/transformation, with "blooming resistance" earned through concrete actions rather than declaration. The paper cranes with "instructions for breathing" and the rebuilt spiral nest embody resistance as creative reconstruction. The ending reweights earlier isolation into collaborative possibility without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice combines poetic compression ("vagrant penny poet," "iron dust into desert wind") with concrete prison detail. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I only read the spine translations"/"Then you're tasting the bones, not the marrow"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("jurisdiction-less, a sovereign gap") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("Skin splits at shoulder blades," "flames bloom green, luminous fracture"). Information density high in most passages. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("beauty from anarchy" appears twice) and some filter constructions that could be more immediate ("Lark feels the new personality settling").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The monthly molting as literal skin-shedding is genuinely fresh, avoiding metaphorical cliché. The coffee tin's false bottom storing past selves, paper cranes with micro-poems lodged in dictionaries - these specific details feel invented rather than borrowed. The transformation from solitary to collaborative resistance offers a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
