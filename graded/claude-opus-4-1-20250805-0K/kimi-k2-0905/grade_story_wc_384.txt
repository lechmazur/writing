<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between vengeance and forgiveness drives meaningful change through concrete embodied moments (bloodied palm, writing confession). The final renunciation of her forger identity carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("guilt and rage") rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Mara transforms from forger to truth-writer, with blood as literal cost. The seventeen-year arc coheres through recurring sanctuary/thorn/key motifs that reweight at the ending. Slight ding for orientation arriving late (~120 words) though it serves the meditative opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary constrains choices (site of sister's death, childhood memories) and charges the final image through blood-writing on marble. Sensory detail is selective (stalactites dripping, aurora's pearl light). Deduction for some generic descriptors ("cold marble," "ancient stones") rather than more specific texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgiveness vs vengeance) deepens through blood-writing that mirrors sister's death, with visible cost in leaving behind the thorn. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens as seventeen years of "calibrated treason" culminates in self-forgiveness. Minor issue: the external conflict (regime) remains abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: blood-writing, inherited thorn, key imagery create resonant answer about forgiveness beginning with oneself. The final image (emerging into light, leaving thorn behind) reweights prior vengeance without stating a moral. Slight deduction for one instance of theme-speak ("great manuscript of existence").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature (forger's attention to handwriting, calibration). Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity. Deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("calibrated treason," "penitent") that doesn't fully match Mara's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is strong with most lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive phrasing hurts momentum ("calibrated treason" appears 6 times, "heritage rose thorn" 5 times). Template cadence in middle section ("She'd calibrated... She removed... She began..."). The prose artifacts don't touch closure but create drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forger-as-resistance-fighter premise offers a fresh angle, and the sanctuary-as-witness device creates originality. However, the vengeance-to-forgiveness arc follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail. The specific seventeen-year timeline and blood-writing ritual add some distinction.</comment>
