I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards provided.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Mira finding the ticket through discovering the truth and choosing forgiveness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between duty and reconciliation drives genuine choices with visible cost. The shift from "quiet night registrar" to active truth-seeker feels earned through concrete pressures. Minor deduction for Rico and Jun's somewhat convenient emotional openness at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from ticket discovery through lens recovery to collective absolution, with the projector screening serving as resonant reconfiguration. The "freed by honesty" concept lands with visible relational cost. Slight weakness in the convenience of Rico and Jun's presence timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and projection booth create atmospheric pressure, with the missing lens constraining choices. Setting details like "rain threading the crystal pillars" enhance mood without overwhelming. The projector-as-resolution-tool effectively uses environment to shape the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from accounting discrepancy to trust restoration through Mira's discovery of the staged hunt. The choice to "let both go" (lens and truth) forecloses accusation with clear relational cost. One meaningful tightening when she discovers the orchestration suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lens metaphor - transparency versus opacity, seeing versus hiding. The projected memories create resonant answer to trust questions without moralizing. "Secrecy had imprisoned them, honesty would free them" lands through action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with selective perception ("the hush breathe back at her"). Some elevated diction ("crystal whispering forecourt") fits the quiet registrar's contemplative nature. Dialogue feels slightly staged but carries necessary subtext about fear and frozen relationships.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetition of "resonant hush" and some slight overwriting in atmospheric passages ("plankton in the beam").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cryptic doodles as breadcrumb trail offers fresh angle on workplace reconciliation. The projection of shared memories as wordless apology shows originality. Somewhat conventional resolution of mistrust-through-honesty theme prevents higher score.</comment>
