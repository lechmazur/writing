<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's quiet integrity drives genuine internal conflict between exposing truth and preserving fragile workplace peace, with her final choice to "let both go" earning its cost through prior dramatization. The embodied details ("heart drumming a funeral march for resentment") avoid therapy-speak while Rico and Jun's voices remain distinct if occasionally convergent under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration when three colleagues sweep "no longer guarding their silences," with visible cost in Mira's choice to release both evidence and grievance. The causal chain from cryptic ticket through eavesdropping to projection room discovery maintains clear linkage, though the convenience of Rico and Jun's staged confession slightly weakens mid-story causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" establishes distinctive atmosphere that charges the final image when "three colleagues swept the floor side by side." Sensory details like "dust floated like plankton" and "resonant hush that felt like listening to snow fall upward" create specificity, though the projection booth and its missing lens don't fully constrain choices beyond plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring trust among frozen staff factions—escalates meaningfully when Mira discovers the staged hunt yet chooses transparency over accusation, with visible cost in releasing both truth and grievance. The turn from potential confrontation ("hot on her tongue") to silent withdrawal demonstrates agency under the causal lens, though the antagonists' convenient presence weakens pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the projected "Staff Memories" that "speak the apology no sentence could carry," with the final doodle of an "open lock" resonating against earlier images of "a mouth sewn shut." The story resists moralizing, letting the swept floor and unlocked gates embody how "secrecy had imprisoned them, honesty would free them" without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in phrases like "the timeframe after words become unnecessary" and "snow fall upward," maintaining Mira's quiet registrar perspective consistently. Dialogue differentiates Rico's directness from Jun's analytical tone, though some elevated diction ("absolution," "foreclosing") occasionally drifts from the established register without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful imagery like "trust was cheaper than security cameras," though occasional register elevation ("gambling that her scruples would do the rest") creates minor friction. Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, and the closing image of trust settling "like a cloak that fit at last" avoids cliché while landing the emotional weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cryptic doodles leading to staged revelation offers a fresh angle on workplace mistrust narratives, with specific details like the burned projection reel and "Staff Memories 1998-2018" grounding the concept. While the trust-through-transparency arc follows recognizable patterns, the execution through silent film projection and the final image of colleagues sweeping together transforms familiar material through particularity.</comment>
