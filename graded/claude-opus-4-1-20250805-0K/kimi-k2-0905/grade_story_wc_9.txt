<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's grief over her stillborn child drives consistent, embodied choices through concrete details like the saucer crack and hand-tracing ritual. The internal contradiction between holding on and letting go plays out through action rather than summary, culminating in an earned renunciation where she speaks the unspoken name. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("choking beauty," "willingly perplexed") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered imagery (clouds condensing time, porcelain voices, ink trails) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartomancer accepts loss while maintaining love. The closure lands with clear emotional cost as she creates a permanent midnight glade "inside her" where imaginary tea stays warm. Orientation slightly delayed but pays off; the fantastical elements cohere into grief metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade above/inside clouds functions as both literal setting and psychological landscape, constraining the cartomancer's journey through physical laws (time falling upward, moss where starlight cannot reach). Sensory details like "moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold" filter through grief-altered perception. The setting literally transforms—cloud descending, glade internalizing—to mirror and enable the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—processing stillbirth grief—intensifies through accumulating imagery rather than causal reversals, fitting the textural lens. The saucer crack widening into a canyon of porcelain voices asking "why Mommy never finished the tea party" deepens pressure effectively. Cost is legible as "years of lullabies, first steps" flood her lungs—the price of imagined futures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images of fractures as doorways, time pooling in strange places, and the paradox of "children who exist forever in the choking beauty of almost." The final image of mothers finding her outline "traced in ink that never fades" offers resonant consolation without moralizing. The piece earns its wisdom about grief through specifics: the dolls' tea party, the hand-tracing custom, the cloudbound repentance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistent dream-logic through inventive compounds ("onyx-ink," "cloudbound") and synesthetic perception ("spiral that tasted of iron and lullabies"). Some register elevation feels forced ("willingly perplexed," "choking beauty") rather than emerging from character psychology. The perceptual signature of grief-altered time perception is strong, though occasional abstract constructions dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("time had begun to pool in strange places—behind the mirror, inside the chimney") but suffers from density overload and abstract constructions. Phrases like "willingly perplexed" and "choking beauty" appear multiple times without earning their opacity. Some metaphors strain coherence (the saucer crack becoming both river and canyon). Information density is high but clarity occasionally sacrificed for poetic effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a cartomancer reading grief through a cracked tea saucer while climbing above clouds where time falls upward shows genuine originality. The synthesis of tarot reading, childhood loss, and temporal distortion creates something memorably specific. The family custom of hand-tracing on tablecloths transformed into sky-writing demonstrates inventive repurposing of domestic ritual for cosmic grief work.</comment>
