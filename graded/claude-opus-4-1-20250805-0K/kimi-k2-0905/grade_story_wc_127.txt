<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from detached dealer to porous empath is earned through concrete sensory experience (the scent blooming "like a bruise") and embodied cost ("let it hurt"). The contradictory impulses between professional detachment and the need to feel something real act simultaneously throughout, particularly in the tension between her hidden vials and her choice to sample the chemist's offering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lira's transformation from armored detachment to "porous, aching affection," with visible cost in her kneeling, the cracked vial, and choosing pain as "proof she was still reachable." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward this reconfiguration, though the chemist's role could be more causally integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto's resin-and-secrets atmosphere creates genuine constraint—the "fossilized sap" pool and "copper light" transitioning to darkness mirror Lira's transformation. The grotto functions as cathedral by the end, with static electricity providing tactile connection between characters and earth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional curiosity ("tracked him for weeks") through the risk of sampling ("never sampled her own wares") to accepting the full weight of her victims' emotions. The cost is legible in her physical collapse and the choice to "let it hurt," though the chemist's passivity slightly weakens the interpersonal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of authentic feeling versus commodified emotion emerges through concrete particulars—the "counterfeit emotions" becoming real pain, "insight without empathy was just surveillance." The final image of staying with the hurt as "proof she was still reachable" offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric density with distinctive perceptual signature ("light itself seemed to hesitate," "bloomed like a bruise"). The prose modulates effectively during transformation, though occasional elevated diction ("cathedral of static and scent") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control ("honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus of almost-joy") and varied syntax create momentum. Some repetitive structures appear ("There was the grief... There was the rage") but serve accumulative purpose. Minor density issues in places but information-rich overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an emotion dealer who has never felt authentically offers fresh inflection on the healer-who-needs-healing trope. The specific synthesis of counterfeit emotions, scent-as-memory, and static electricity as connection creates memorable texture, though the chemist figure edges toward archetype.</comment>
