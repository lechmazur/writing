I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory and emotional details toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira's detachment transforms into porous empathy.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from emotional dealer to empathic being is earned through concrete sensory experience. The contradictory impulses between her professional detachment and need "to feel something real" act simultaneously in scene. Her final acceptance of hurt as "proof she was still reachable" shows meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - Lira's armor of detachment dissolves into "porous, aching affection." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (scent, static, amber) build toward her transformation. The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the pattern of half-truths reweights at closure where "a beginning" replaces her empire of diluted emotions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as more than setting - it's a "cathedral of static and scent" that enables transformation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (resin, fossilized sap, copper light). The grotto's "ancient air" absorbing the blotter oils creates a lived-in world where setting constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake - Lira's need for authentic feeling versus her professional detachment - deepens through the scent experience that forces her to feel what her clients felt. The cost is unmistakable: her armor becomes "a discarded coat" and she accepts the hurt of every half-truth she sold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of counterfeit emotions versus real feeling. "Insight without empathy was just surveillance" crystallizes without preaching. The final image of Lira pressing her palm to earth's "steady, indifferent, alive" hum offers a non-literal answer about connection versus detachment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature tracks Lira's professional assessment shifting to vulnerable experience. The prose modulates from controlled observation to sensory immersion during transformation. Minor wobble in the chemist's dialogue ("You'll feel what they felt. But not why.") reads slightly stilted against the lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("bloomed like a bruise," "honeyed regret, sharp with the citrus of almost-joy"). Some density issues in peak beats - "cathedral of static and scent" and multiple metaphors cluster without full integration. The "vials sewn into the lining" and later "a vial cracked" create clean bookends.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The counterfeit emotion dealer premise offers a fresh angle on authentic versus performed feeling. The synthesis of commercial emotion-selling with genuine transformation feels specific and earned. The grotto as confessional space and the blotter petal as communion wafer create original religious resonance without heavy-handedness.</comment>
