Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate it systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered metaphors of chess, weaving, and labyrinths toward a resonant reconfiguration where Marek's guilt transforms into acceptance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek's internal journey from paralyzing guilt to "fierce repose" is well-earned through concrete chess metaphors and embodied gestures. The contradiction between his teaching expertise and his failure with the duke's daughter creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional transitions ("winnowing guilt from memory").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marek's acceptance crystallizes through the physical act of righting the fallen king, with visible cost in "lines of his face rearranged." The accumulative pattern of chess/weaving/labyrinth metaphors coheres beautifully. Slight opacity in the time-freeze mechanism's causality prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village with its suspended inhabitants creates effective pressure, and the platinum labyrinth constrains Marek's path to resolution. However, the magical elements lack grounding rules - why this village, why now? The tactile details of frayed threads and stone chess pieces anchor key moments well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through decoding the tapestry to walking the labyrinth to the final king gesture, each deepening Marek's understanding. The cost is legible in his acceptance that "teaching also means learning to forgive the teacher." One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, though the stakes could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness-as-reframing emerges organically through chess metaphors: "The board is wider than the mistake." The interplay between teaching/learning, solving/accepting creates genuine complexity. The final lesson avoids moralizing while offering resonant wisdom earned through concrete experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with chess-inflected perception ("fierce repose of tournament halls," "winnowing variations"). Free indirect style handles Marek's interiority cleanly. Some register elevation in places ("woven hush lay over every cobblestone like thick felt") slightly strains the POV but serves the lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cobblestones like thick felt," "thunder finally rolled across the roofs, loud and cleansing"). However, abstract constructions appear frequently ("winnow guilt from memory," "geometric penance"), and some metaphor mixing occurs (chess/weaving/labyrinth). The "fierce repose" repetition works as purposeful patterning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy with grief processing offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives. The time-frozen village as externalized psychological space shows originality. The specific detail of algebraic notation in tapestry threads demonstrates inventive world-building, though the concept doesn't fully escape therapeutic journey templates.</comment>
