<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek's internal journey from paralyzing guilt to "fierce repose" is earned through concrete interaction with the tapestry and labyrinth, with his fidgeting hands serving as embodied emotion throughout. The transformation from teaching-as-pride to teaching-as-forgiveness lands with visible cost in the final image. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("winnow guilt from memory") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) lands cleanly: Marek accepts his role as teacher who must also forgive himself, with the cost visible in "lines of his face rearranged." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition builds through tapestry-decoding to labyrinth-walking to final acceptance. Slight dock for the time-freeze mechanism feeling somewhat arbitrary to the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth constrain Marek's choices effectively, with the tapestry's frayed threads becoming the key to resolution. The frozen/unfrozen states mirror internal stasis/movement well. Deduction for some vague spatial choreography in the middle sections and the fountain-labyrinth relationship remaining unclear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from solving-puzzle-for-forgiveness to recognizing-acceptance-requires-forward-movement, with the decoded chess game forcing Marek to see his guilt differently. The cost lands in accepting the teacher's need for self-forgiveness. Minor dock for the resolution feeling slightly predetermined once the pattern is recognized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chess-as-life metaphor develops organically through concrete details: the suicidal king sequence, the labyrinth as mental circling, "The board is wider than the mistake." Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing, and the final teaching moment reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with chess-mind filtering reality ("fierce repose of tournament halls"), and the voice maintains consistency through emotional shifts. Some elevated diction ("winnow," "marginalia") fits the tutor character. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cobblestones like thick felt," "thunder now matching the storm outside"). However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("penance disguised as geometry"), some filter-verb clusters, and occasional purple prose ("steel-blue glow of the frozen moment") accumulate to dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The time-frozen village as guilt-space and the tapestry-as-chess-notation show genuine originality, transforming the chess-tutor premise beyond template. The "fierce repose" concept and teaching-as-mutual-learning angle feel fresh. Some predictability in the guilt-to-acceptance arc prevents higher scoring.</comment>
