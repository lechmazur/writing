<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilyra's transformation from archivist to living equation is earned through consistent internal contradictions (prism-minded perception fracturing reality) and embodied responses to the grotto's pull. The choice between consumption, librarianship, and the "third option" crystallizes her values with visible cost—her memories scatter into violet light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Ilyra's transformation into "the combination she sought," with clear cost (memory dissolution) legible in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the doodle's evolution, gravity inversion, and manuscript proliferation, though the "third option" moment could be more causally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as both setting and antagonist—"living calculation" whose architecture reveals itself during inversion, directly constraining Ilyra's choices. The environment's transformation (mist to viscous strands, shelves to floating manuscripts) charges the final image of empty walls carved with the recurring symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the manuscript's increasing luminosity, the doodle's animation, and Ilyra's recognition that the grotto feeds on memory failure, forcing her climactic choice. The cost is unmistakable—she dissolves into the collection she once catalogued—though the "third option" slightly undercuts the binary's pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of "forgotten combinations" that exist only while being lost, avoiding abstraction through specific images (the margin doodle, inverted gravity, scattered memories). The ending reweights all prior cataloguing as both preservation and consumption without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct elevated register fitting an archivist's perception ("prism-minded," "constituent truths," "threshold effects") with consistent psychic distance. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") but the perceptual signature—fracturing light into components—remains character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers (plot, atmosphere, theme), though some metaphorical density obscures clarity ("seeds of vigilance took root...as a latent blaze"). The recurring spiral-and-dot motif effectively structures the piece, and the final truncation ("whose mind could fracture") creates purposeful incompletion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of an archive that consumes its archivists through gravity inversion offers genuine freshness, with the "living equation" transformation avoiding predictable outcomes. The specific synthesis of mathematical proofs for mercy and maps to places "that existed only while being lost" elevates beyond genre conventions.</comment>
