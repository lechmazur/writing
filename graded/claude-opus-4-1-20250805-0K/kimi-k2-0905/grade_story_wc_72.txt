<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The statue's awakening through telepathy creates genuine interiority with contradictory impulses ("revelation is not a hammer; it is a dialogue spoken in fractures"), and the final choice to break the ampoule shows visible cost through the city's transformation. The gardener's characterization as "incisively kind" manifests concretely in her choice to preserve memory rather than verdict. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional states ("shy curiosity of anemones") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the garden transforms from "museum of certainties" to living ambiguity with clear cost (dissolution of certainties). The ampoule's breaking at the keystone arch causes cascading revelations that reconfigure the entire underwater city. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (underwater garden, statue POV). Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting constrains choices effectively—the statue must navigate "over gardens of sea-grass that bowed like courtiers" to reach the keystone arch. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("moonlight arrived only as a bruised glow"). The foxglove ampoule and structural weakness of the arch directly enable the climactic action. Minor deduction for some overly figurative descriptions that occasionally obscure spatial clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether to release memory that will dissolve comfortable certainties—"without breakage, the city would remain a museum of certainties, beautiful and extinct." The pressure deepens through accumulation as other statues awaken and ask "whether change hurt as fiercely as stasis." Cost is visible in the transformation but could be more viscerally felt. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate choice to crack the ampoule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between certainty and nuance—"poison and remedy share roots." The ending offers a non-literal answer as statues begin "arguing gently over what truth might become tomorrow." The foxglove ampoule serves as concrete vehicle for abstract concepts of memory and truth. Slight deduction for one instance of theme-echo in "welcome nuance" that feels prompt-aligned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("moonlight arrived only as a bruised glow," "warm ink"). Voice maintains consistency through elevated register appropriate to the statue-narrator's formal origins. Some excellent rhythm control in peak moments ("I sent a single thought upward, a message in a bubble"). Minor deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract phrasing that strains the POV's established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, several instances of figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("calcified certainty," "museum of certainties," "suspended silt"). Some template cadence in the middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater ruins with sentient statuary and telepathic awakening. The concept of memory preserved in liquid form that can propagate "like rings on a pond" shows genuine ingenuity. The gardener's choice to encode nuance rather than verdict transforms expected betrayal narrative. Risk-taking in the conceptual ending where uncertainty becomes generative rather than threatening adds distinction.</comment>
