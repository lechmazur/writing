<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The statue's awakening creates a compelling internal progression from mineral consciousness to active choice-maker, with the gardener's memory adding layered motivation. The "incisively kind" characterization of the gardener enriches backstory but lacks embodied contradiction in present action. Minor deduction for diagnostic label-speak ("shy curiosity of anemones") in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the garden transforms from hiding to welcoming, with visible cost in the statue's own transformation to "possibility." The ampoule-breaking creates decisive change with earned consequences. Slight weakness in orientation (underwater location clear, but temporal anchoring vague beyond "thirty fathoms below").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting actively constrains movement ("glided over gardens") and provides the keystone arch that enables resolution. Vivid sensory detail throughout ("moonlight arrived only as a bruised glow," "metallic tears"). The setting transformation at closure ("corals of ambiguity, anemones of doubt") charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Central stake of revelation versus stasis is signaled early and deepens through the statue's deliberation at the arch. The cost is legible—breaking the ampoule means "admitting the court...condemned the gardener for treason." However, the antagonistic pressure remains abstract (no active opposition), and resolution comes somewhat easily once the choice is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between certainty and nuance, crystallizing in "poison and remedy share roots." The final image of "statues arguing gently over what truth might become" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong subtext in the gardener's "diving toward mercy" when guards thought they sent her to death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("thought bloom inside my mineral skull like warm ink"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization limits for a statue consciousness. Slight register elevation in places ("calcified into truth") but serves the piece's tone. The perceptual signature of telepathic awareness is well-maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density high in most passages. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("Each footfall triggered small awakenings") and slight template cadence in the middle section's parallel constructions. The closing image lands cleanly without loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of awakened statues in an underwater garden offers fresh angle on consciousness/memory themes. The foxglove ampoule as memory vessel and the gardener's backstory avoid cliché. However, the resolution toward openness and dialogue feels somewhat safe—the piece could risk more in its final stance.</comment>
