I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the temple transforms from silence-keeper to signal-amplifier.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to survive drives clear micro-choices (tightening the copper coil, diving deeper, sacrificing her mother's vial). Her internal conflict between fleeing and persisting manifests in embodied action. The final choice to leave the vial as offering shows earned character change through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the temple transforms from muffling presence to amplifying ally through Mira's sacrifice of the lilac drop. Cost is visible in losing her "last anchor to home." The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details (hush, resonance, lilac) build toward the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple functions as active antagonist through stone tendrils and muffling hush, then becomes co-protagonist after the organ awakens. Sensory layering (pressure, brine, luminous plankton) creates visceral immersion. The coral-grown organ serves as crucial constraint and opportunity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to breaking the temple's ancient solitude. The tightening occurs when Mira must sacrifice her irreplaceable keepsake to activate the organ. Cost is legible: she trades her last connection to home for a chance at rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming isolation into connection emerges through concrete action (feeding scent to the organ). The final image of the temple broadcasting "lilac-tinged" signals to dreaming sailors offers a non-literal answer about how memory persists through unexpected vessels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric control with distinctive perceptual signature ("exiled cartographer," "kelp-thin laughter"). Compression serves the underwater setting. The shift from Mira's intimate POV to the wider view of the temple's continued broadcasting provides effective distance modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward density ("lonesome splendor," "cathedral-wide resonance") but serves the accumulative mode. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some filter verbs ("she felt memories being touched") slightly dull immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of perfume-as-frequency and temple-as-transmitter feels fresh and earned. The transformation of a preservation instinct into broadcast capability through scent-memory offers genuine surprise. Risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
