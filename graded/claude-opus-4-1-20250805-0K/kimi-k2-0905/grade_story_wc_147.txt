I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where the temple transforms from muffling presence to amplifying voice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to survive and map resonance is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tightening the copper coil and uncorking the vial. Her internal conflict between fleeing instinct and determination to be heard creates authentic tension. The transformation from "exiled cartographer" to someone who "stayed, recording the temple's newborn chords" shows earned character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the temple transforms from silencing force to perpetual broadcaster, with the lilac-scented signal creating lasting change. The cost is palpable: Mira sacrifices her mother's keepsake and risks death. The accumulative structure builds pressure through the organ discovery, the vial sacrifice, and the temple's awakening, each beat tightening options toward the crystallized moment of rescue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple functions as both setting and antagonist, its "gathered hush" and stone tendrils creating physical constraints that shape Mira's choices. Sensory details like "cracked lapis tiles," "luminous plankton," and "bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms" create a vivid, specific world. The coral-grown organ becomes the pivotal environmental element that enables transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from simple survival to preserving memory and connection, with the temple's resistance creating mounting pressure. The dominant stake—getting a signal out before air runs out—tightens when Mira must sacrifice her most precious object. The cost is legible when she places the empty vial as "an offering too small to see yet too large to measure."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between solitude and connection, silence and song. The lilac vial's transformation from personal keepsake to universal signal beautifully embodies how individual memory can transcend isolation. The ending's "perfumed proof that even when time runs short, a single voice—scented, stubborn, and true—can teach stone to yearn" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical precision with distinctive phrasing like "exiled cartographer turned signal-sender" and "memories being touched, brushed by invisible curators." The controlled, contemplative rhythm matches Mira's methodical nature under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices technical details (copper coil, radio mast) alongside sensory poetry (lilac drop "spherical and luminous").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "knees bruised by pressure and guilt" conveys physical state, emotional burden, and time passage. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral," "liturgy") occasionally strains but serves the mythic tone. Information flows cleanly with strong syntactic variety and no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater exploration, synaesthetic transformation (scent to frequency), and ancient architecture learning human loneliness creates genuine originality. The specific detail of translating "fragrance into frequency" through a copper coil shows imaginative problem-solving. Risk-taking in the lyrical, non-standard structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
