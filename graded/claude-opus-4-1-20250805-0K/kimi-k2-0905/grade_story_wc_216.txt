<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timekeeper's motivation to understand time's texture after numbers lose meaning is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (collecting tags, building cairn, trading fragment). His internal journey from measuring to exchanging sensations shows genuine transformation with visible cost—surrendering his urn fragment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through garage sale descriptions until the final realization that time is exchanged through narrative rather than measured. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the timekeeper understands time as sensory exchange, with the cost being his surrendered fragment. Some causality softness around why numbers suddenly "changed meaning" weakens the opening frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as both literal setting and metaphoric vessel for transformation, with dust motes as "former digits" creating atmosphere. Sensory details like the "fine metallic dust that settled on the tongue" and light that "tasted faintly of iron" effectively embody abstract concepts. The setting constrains choice when the timekeeper must climb to gain perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to understand time to communal exchange system where "stories became the currency." The timekeeper's sacrifice of his urn fragment for "one genuine shiver" shows meaningful cost. Pressure coheres but could tighten more dramatically between discovery and final exchange.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of measurement into narrative—"embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions until the stories became the currency." The final image of time as exchanged sensations offers a non-literal answer to how we value experience without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled metaphoric density ("dust motes drifted without urgency, each mote a former digit"). Perceptual signature clear in how the timekeeper reads objects as temporal vessels. Some elevated diction ("anticipated mysteries," "soft, unofficial ledgers") occasionally drifts from established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in descriptions like "Fragment of final container, carries the echo of last exhalation, trades for one genuine shiver." Some template cadence in middle section ("He realized... He understood... He asked...") and slight overwriting in metaphoric passages dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-currency with garage sale culture creates unexpected resonance. The concept of objects holding temporal memories ("Coffee mug that remembers every 6 a.m. you ever faced") shows genuine originality. Risk-taking in the lyric mode mostly succeeds though occasionally strains accessibility.</comment>
