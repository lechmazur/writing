<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The interpreter's progression from assumption-bound technician to cosmic translator is earned through concrete sensory experiences (tingling fingertips mapping constellations, tears at recognition). Her choice to discard assumptions like "sailors ditch ballast" drives the closure with visible cost—the sequin's sublimation. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("every finale as merely the fold where the tape loops") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery until the shard dissolves into "every lost broadcast." The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—silence revealed as protective cocoon rather than threat—with clear cost in the sacrificed star fragment. The orientation anchors (Tower 7, interpreter, lunar perigee) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tower city suspended over the gorge functions as more than backdrop—its swaying/stillness mirrors the story's tension/resolution, and the "black gorge" transforms from void to "pregnant with every voice." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (boots ringing, antennas humming like grammatical crickets). The micro-setting of the star fragment constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preventing the shard from eating transmissions to discovering it protects "what came before the noise began." The interpreter's agency drives the deepening through deliberate assumption-shedding and tuning adjustments. Cost is visible in the fragment's sublimation, though the conflict could benefit from more immediate resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that "every quiet is merely rehearsal, every finale a hinge." The final image of building a new receiver from discarded parts resonates without stating a moral. The hollywood star fragment's transformation from human vanity to cosmic filament deepens the meditation on endings/beginnings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("lunar perigee tugged the moon so close it seemed to listen"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative design with taught patterns like "serenely electric" paying off in physical sensation. Minor register elevation in places ("pregnant with every voice") fits the cosmic scope without breaking POV consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("antennas humming like crickets that had learned grammar"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("sublimated into pure photon") but it serves the fantastical register. Clear propulsion through varied syntax, though occasional abstract loops ("every ending...merely turning around") slightly reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of silence as protective cocoon rather than absence is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of radio technology with cosmic interpretation, rendered through specific sensory detail, feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
