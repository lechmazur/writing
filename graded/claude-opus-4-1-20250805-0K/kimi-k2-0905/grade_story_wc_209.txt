<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's quietly driven need evolves through embodied gestures (pinning postcards, lying on branches, painting on glass) that accumulate toward her transformative understanding. The internal contradiction between painting dawn while seeking night's truth creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract resolution lacking a final embodied choice with clearer personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through seasonal progression and recurring night-bloom imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora's painted pavilion becomes a living postcard. The cost is felt through her departure ("walked west... following the melting snow") and the transformation of her artistic practice. Slight deduction for the extended coda that dilutes the closure's immediate impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pavilion's amber panes and copper ribs constrain Liora's artistic choices, while seasonal shifts from autumn frost to spring thaw create temporal pressure. Exceptional integration of etched glass as both literal setting detail and metaphorical constraint ("scripture of shadows"). The moonflowers' nocturnal blooming directly shapes the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through seasonal progression and Liora's evolving understanding, with the 1912 postcard's message ("reckon with the shadow") creating a specific challenge she must solve through embodied practice. The stakes deepen when she discovers painting absence rather than light. Minor deduction for relatively gentle escalation that could push harder against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of darkness/light, absence/presence, with the moonflowers' nocturnal blooming serving as natural metaphor for hidden layers of understanding. The final question "what in you opens only when no one is looking?" resonates without moralizing. Exceptional integration of visual art as a means of spiritual discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on light, shadow, and botanical imagery. Strong perceptual signature in how Liora notices "frost settle on her eyelashes" and sees branches as cathedral window leading. Minor deduction for occasional elevation into abstraction ("umbral tenderness") that slightly distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (setting/theme/character). Strong figurative coherence throughout, particularly "etched glass catching moonlight like frozen breath." Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("the dawning hush is") and some repetitive constructions around "quietly driven" and "umbral tenderness."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of visual art, cathedral architecture, and botanical cycles creates an original meditation on creative process. The specific detail of painting on pavilion glass to create negative/positive space effects shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation of artistic practice through seasonal patience offers a non-obvious angle on the creative journey.</comment>
