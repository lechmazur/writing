<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vendor's transformation into a doorway demonstrates genuine cost through self-erasure, and her pricing system of "quantifying absence" creates consistent character logic. Internal contradiction appears when she realizes "she had been the protagonist all along" yet must subtract herself, though this paradox serves the closure rather than undermining it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the vendor becomes the doorway, reweighting the entire transaction system with visible cost ("customers stepped through her"). The accumulative lens holds as each sale adds weight until the library literally tilts, forcing the final transformation. Minor orientation drift with "swirling sea of clouds" and spatial mechanics slightly obscures the physical reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard with crystal fruit containing syllables creates a vivid, constraint-generating environment that directly shapes the vendor's choices and the library's destabilization. Setting actively participates in closure when "the library was a seed crystal trying to nucleate a world from the absence she collected."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation as each transaction makes the library heavier until "the swirling sea of clouds below cracked into spiral notebooks of storm," forcing the vendor's self-sacrifice. The cost is legible when she drinks moonlight and becomes what she glimpsed—"the outline of the door she had seen."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of creation requiring absence, crystallized in "Stories begin where memory ends; I sell the scissors." The final image of the shattered bottle's words rearranging into "the first sentence of whatever tale the next reader would dare to begin" offers resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("a lull so delicate it felt like the building itself was deciding whether to stay aloft") with controlled lyric register that intensifies appropriately. The librarian's voice ("You are incising more than moments") maintains distinction from the vendor's pragmatic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("seven bottles of moonlight, each labeled with a parole word—glimmering, unmoored, rebegin—that flickered like fireflies unsure whether they were free or merely escaped"). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("swirling sea of clouds below cracked into spiral notebooks of storm") but serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of selling absence to create narrative space demonstrates genuine originality, executed through specific mechanics (scales weighing absence heavier than objects, moonlight as tradeable substance). The vendor becoming her own traded absence elevates beyond typical transaction stories. Risk-taking with the metaphysical premise heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
