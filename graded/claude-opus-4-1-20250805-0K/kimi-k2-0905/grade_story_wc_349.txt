<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vendor's transformation into "the outline of the door" offers a compelling self-erasure with visible cost, though her earlier motivations remain abstract. The boy's transaction shows concrete embodied choice (marble, violet, sigh), but the librarian's shift from index-being to swaying string feels unearned. Internal contradictions act in scene during key transactions, particularly the vendor's realization that "she had been the protagonist all along."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through bottle transactions building to the vendor's self-dissolution. Orientation anchors (glass orchard library, vendor, opening day) establish by ~50 words. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with cost as the vendor becomes the door and customers step through her, though the conceptual leap to "she had been the protagonist" lacks sufficient causality. Pattern holds but the philosophical weight occasionally outpaces dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard with crystal fruit containing syllables creates vivid, constraining architecture that shapes every transaction. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("brass doors exhaled," "chiming fruit," "obsidian floor cracks"). The environment actively pressures choices—the building tilts as memories shift weight, clouds crack into spiral notebooks. The final shattering bottle that rearranges into "the first sentence" charges the closure with environmental agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of "incising the day" to find "where stories begin" signals early but remains conceptually abstract. Escalation occurs through accumulating transactions that make the library heavier until it threatens to fall, forcing the vendor's self-erasure. However, the pressure feels more philosophical than visceral—customers want "beginnings they lack" but the actual cost of these absences never fully dramatizes. The vendor's agency drives the resolution but the stakes remain oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of quantifying absence to create presence, with the vendor ultimately subtracting herself to enable others' stories. The recurring moonlight bottles and parole words accumulate meaning without explicit moralizing. The final image of shattered glass rearranging into "the first sentence" offers a resonant answer about creative genesis requiring self-dissolution. Subtext operates effectively in the transactions—what's traded reveals character values.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise. Perceptual signature clear in how the vendor notices algorithmic patterns in chaos and measures absence. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. Some register elevation ("nucleate a world," "ephemeral dedications") occasionally distances from immediate pressure, but the prose texture coheres with the conceptual ambition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"bottles of moonlight, each labeled with a parole word" establishes object, magic system, and linguistic theme simultaneously. Some conceptual abstraction dulls momentum ("quantifying absence could she map the negative space"). The prose avoids loops but occasionally privileges philosophy over clarity, particularly in passages about the library as "seed crystal." Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vendor-as-story-enabler with the specific mechanism of selling quantified absence. The glass orchard library as living organism that grows heavy with unrealized narratives offers genuine originality. The transformation of familiar commerce into metaphysical exchange, culminating in the vendor becoming infrastructure for others' passages, feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking in the conceptual density pays off through coherent world-building.</comment>
