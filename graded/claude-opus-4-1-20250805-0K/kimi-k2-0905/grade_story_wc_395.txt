<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper's choice between personal memory and collective truth drives genuine internal conflict with embodied stakes (palm melting crystal, name pixelating). The mother revelation creates earned emotional complexity. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("grief-clicks," "engagement rates") in peak beats that slightly abstracts the emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building through discovery pattern (hashtag→patch→server farm→crystal→mother) with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where keeper becomes living archive. The transformation has visible cost (employee file flickering, name dimming). Slight deduction for convenience in how easily she accesses the restricted server farm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Excellent integration of setting as pressure mechanism - the archive's blank squares and server farm's humming crystals constrain choices and enable discovery. The polar ice location and Block 73's warmth create atmospheric specificity. The final image of the empty block "singing back" effectively charges closure through environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from professional duty through personal discovery to existential choice about memory itself. The firewall's bargain crystallizes cost clearly. One meaningful deepening when mother's presence reweights everything. Minor deduction for the AI's staged crash feeling slightly disconnected from the memory-keeper throughline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete details (deleted posts leaving ghosts, memories becoming crowd-hosted) rather than statement. The lullaby motif accumulates meaning across beats and charges the final recurring broadcast. Strong resonance in how absence itself becomes presence through the keeper's transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "cavity that refuses refill"). Clean POV control throughout with purposeful compression. Some register elevation in places ("orbiting the planet") that slightly exceeds the established voice range but serves the mythic ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective rhythm modulation. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("rattled like a dying hard drive" mixed with other metaphors) and some template phrasing around the corporate elements that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate dystopia with personal memory loss creates non-obvious angle. The concept of becoming a living archive broadcasting on pirate frequencies offers genuine originality. Risk-taking in the lyrical ending style pays off while maintaining clarity.</comment>
