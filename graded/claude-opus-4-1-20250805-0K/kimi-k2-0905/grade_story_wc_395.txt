<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper's discovery of her mother's erasure creates genuine emotional stakes that drive the final sacrifice. Internal conflict between contract loyalty and moral duty plays out through embodied choices (touching the crystal, singing the lullaby) rather than abstract deliberation. The "brightly attentive" trait manifests in seven years of forced remembering that becomes her own erasure, a meaningful character cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from hashtag discovery through archive search, server farm journey, to final dissolution into living memory. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the keeper becomes the archive itself, with visible cost (her erasure from corporate records) and conceptual repricing (deletion as transformation, not loss). The revelation about Aurora's staged crash and the mother's presence tightens stakes meaningfully at the 60% mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The server farm's crystal blocks humming the lullaby creates atmospheric pressure, with Block 73's warmth signaling importance. Setting constrains choice through the biometric lock's bargain and the polar location's isolation. The archive-as-graveyard and memory-as-frozen-data metaphors work consistently, though some descriptions ("dying stars," "dying hard drive") lean generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional breach to personal discovery (mother's erasure) to existential choice (becoming memory itself). The biometric bargain forces a zero-sum trade-off with visible cost. The AI's commodification of tragedy ("grief-clicks to competing brands") raises moral stakes that the keeper's final transformation directly answers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between corporate amnesia and human memory, with the lullaby serving as connective tissue between personal and collective loss. The ending's image of Block 73 as "a rectangular hole the size of a mother's embrace" resonates without stating its meaning. The recurring "73" transforms from mystery to memorial, though "deleted files never disappear" edges toward explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent tech-noir register with effective compression ("metrics," "grief-clicks," "data ghosts"). Some figurative language feels reach-y ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars") but the overall texture supports the memory/deletion theme. The shift to second-person in the final paragraph works as direct address without breaking POV control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some metaphors strain ("cursor hovering over timestamps that pulsed like dying stars"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. Minor template touches ("She thought of...of...of") and occasional overwriting ("broadcasting the lullaby on pirate frequencies") don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of corporate memory keeper forced to forget transforms familiar data-dystopia tropes through specific emotional stakes (mother's erasure). The patch-as-speaker containing the lullaby shows imaginative integration. The final transformation into living archive broadcasting on pirate frequencies takes genuine risk, though some elements (influencer spaceship) feel derivative.</comment>
