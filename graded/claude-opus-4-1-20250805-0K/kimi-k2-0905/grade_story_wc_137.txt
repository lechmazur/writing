I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory memories and images toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara transforms from skeptic to participant in shared human experience.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from "sympathetic skeptic" to someone who chooses to "listen instead of refute" is earned through embodied experience of shared memories. The internal contradiction between her skepticism and her need to process grief creates genuine tension. Her final choice to release the tile shows meaningful change with visible cost (giving up academic proof).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Mara walks south "following the whales, her stride syncing with a pulse not entirely her own." The cost is legible - she sacrifices academic credibility for participatory connection. The accumulative lens holds as memories and sensations build toward this reconfiguration, though the magical mechanism could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower and astrolabe function as active setting that enables transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - "salt galaxies" on glasses, whale exhalations "braided with wind." The tide pool at the end provides concrete closure geography. Some descriptions lean ornamental ("tuning fork waiting to be struck") without constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - processing grief through reason vs. participation - intensifies when the tile's memories surge through Mara. Her choice to "listen instead of refute" marks the key tightening that forecloses her skeptical path. The whales' response validates her transformation with felt cost (abandoning academic duty for connection).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between transcription for academia vs. "the choir inside her." The final image of the sky as "parchment, waiting for the next brave skeptic" resonantly reweights the opening without stating a moral. The tile as "compass for voyages that crossed oceans of time" provides thematic coherence without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("leviathan breaths echoed like drumbeats"). POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature intact. Phrases like "sculpt space for reflection" feel slightly strained but serve the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong, but figurative language occasionally obscures clarity ("the air itself felt like an unheard symphony"). Some template phrasing appears ("Star by star, she aligned"). The prose serves the accumulative mode but contains ornamental passages that don't advance pressure, particularly in early description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The magic square tile as a "keel stone" for temporal voyages offers a fresh angle on memory and connection. The specific synthesis of whale migration, astronomical observation, and shared human memory across centuries feels non-obvious. The ending image of sky as parchment awaiting the next skeptic provides memorable closure.</comment>
