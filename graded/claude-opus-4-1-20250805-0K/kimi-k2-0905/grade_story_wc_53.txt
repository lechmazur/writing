I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** given its lyric, fragmentary structure and pattern of image accumulation toward a resonant exchange/transformation at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's contradictory impulses act simultaneously through the fragment-trading sequence, with each surrender carrying embodied cost ("I feel the first stab of regret"). The final choice to trade places is earned through accumulated losses, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("chronologically confused" as concept rather than lived experience).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when narrator and ghost exchange states, with visible cost ("remain, a fragment collector without pockets"). The accumulative structure coheres through the moon-wheel's year-frames and fragment exchanges, though orientation takes ~150 words to fully anchor who/what/where, slightly dulling early pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices through the kinetic lagoon's cloud-steps and the moon-camera's frame mechanics. The carousel's transformation from frozen to restarted charges the final image with ironic cost, making environment indispensable to the closure's meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulated fragment-losses that make the ghost progressively more solid while depleting the narrator's substance. The final reversal (trading places through the blank frame) arrives with clear cost, though middle exchanges could tighten their individual stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fragment-collecting metaphor and the paradox of incomplete survival versus proper death. The ending's role reversal offers a non-literal answer about identity and regret without moralizing, though some abstract phrasing ("eroded ambitions") weakens embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("brass poles humming like trapped hornets," "moon as disposable camera wheel"). Voice maintains surreal consistency even under pressure, with purposeful compression serving the fragmentary mode rather than obscuring meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control and information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("I am chronologically confused" followed by explanation; "eroded ambitions" then restated as scraped fragments). Template cadence appears in fragment-listing sequence, though overall prose propulsion remains serviceable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moon-as-camera-wheel conceit and fragment-trading system create genuinely fresh mechanics for exploring memory and identity. The specific synthesis of carousel, ghost negotiation, and collected overheard stories feels inevitable in hindsight while avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
