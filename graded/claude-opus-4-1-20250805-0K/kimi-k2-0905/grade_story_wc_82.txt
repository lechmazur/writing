<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The maker's grief-driven motivation to transform her daughter's final dream into paper cranes is powerfully embodied through concrete actions—polishing the moonstone, breathing in the dream until her ribs glow, folding with tears that evaporate into constellations. The internal contradiction between holding and releasing grief acts simultaneously throughout, culminating in an earned renunciation when she sits with only tea-scented hands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the maker transforms grief into living lanterns that will "glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye," with visible cost in the moonstone crumbling and her backward exit erasing traces. The paradoxical descent-while-ascending stair that "erased a day of sorrow from her face and added a line of luminous torment to her eyes" establishes pattern early and pays off through the ritual's transformative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating tea garden and glass basilica create a dreamlike setting where physical laws bend to emotional truth—stones hover, dawn replays from recorded dreams, tea bushes exhale dream fragments. The oneiric engines and their crystal rods constrain the ritual's mechanics while the basilica's stored starlight "from dreamers' memories of winter nights when they were seven" charges the atmosphere with specific emotional resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grief's transformation drives escalation through accumulating density—from carrying "only a pocket of silence" to breathing the dream into glowing ribs to folding forty-nine cranes that become living lanterns. The cost is legible in each phase: the moonstone cracks and leaks, tears become constellations, the maker's luminous torment increases even as sorrow decreases, culminating in the engines darkening "their quota of sorrow met."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of grief's transformation emerges through concrete particulars—lantern-making becomes grief-crafting, "seven strokes water, seven strokes oil" parallels the ritual's precision, and the final image of hands smelling only of tea (not kerosene or grief) offers a non-literal answer about release. The cranes becoming "living lanterns that would glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye" reweights the maker's craft from solitary to communal purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice fuses craft precision ("seven strokes water, seven strokes oil, whisper the name") with lyrical grief ("pale wisp she intended to fold into origami cranes before grief hardened into obsidian"). The perceptual signature—a lantern maker who sees light and fuel everywhere, pocketing a tea leaf because "a lantern maker never wastes fuel, and grief is only another kind of flame"—remains consistent while modulating through the ritual's intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The threshold tasted of iron and lullabies" conveys sensory detail, emotional register, and transition simultaneously. Prose propulsion through accumulating images (shadow detaching, stones hovering, dreams leaking) with no loops or scaffolding. The syntactic variety from short declarations ("She chose the southern stair") to complex accumulations maintains rhythm without template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording technology with ancient grief rituals creates a fresh angle on mourning—the oneiric engines copying dreams onto quartz ribbons, paid for with lamp chimneys, transformed into paper cranes. The paradoxical stair that descends while ascending and the specific detail of stored starlight from "winter nights when they were seven" elevate beyond template grief narratives.</comment>
