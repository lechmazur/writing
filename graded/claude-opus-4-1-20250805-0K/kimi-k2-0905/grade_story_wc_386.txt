<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow's characterization shows strong internal consistency with her role as truth-weaver and ghost whisperer, and her final unguarded smile represents genuine character movement with visible cost. The piece effectively embodies her perceptual state through ice/water imagery and her careful navigation between living and dead. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("salt and forgiveness") rather than pure embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Marrow retrieves the pure snow globe and gains "knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light," with visible cost in the glacier closing and passengers dissolving. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases building to closure. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the glacier/diving context.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glacier-as-body conceit brilliantly constrains choices (air pockets, closing windows, ice walls that stick to skin) and the snow globe's transformation from melted to pure directly shapes the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("crevasse-blue ice," "glacier groaned like a sleeping whale"). The micro-setting of ice/water/temperature consistently pressures action and enables the ghost-whispering mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of salvaging "something pure from the wreckage" escalates through deepening discoveries (shrine windows, memory jellyfish, nested snow globe) with the glacier's closing creating time pressure. The cost is legible as Marrow loses the drowned passengers but gains transformative knowledge. Minor deduction as the middle shrine sequence could tighten its pressure mechanics slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding light within wreckage emerges organically through concrete images (melted/pure globes, borrowed starlight, windows of connection) without explicit moralizing. The final image of footprints filling with future-reflecting meltwater offers a resonant, non-literal answer about transformation through careful truth-weaving. The recurring cameo-appearances concept enriches the theme of interconnected consciousness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("luxury liner folded inside a glacier like a secret") and consistent perceptual signature focused on water/ice states and liminal spaces. Free indirect style is clean with appropriate psychic distance shifts. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation that pushes against plausibility ("planetarium of collective sorrow") though it mostly serves the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with most sentences doing multiple jobs and varied rhythm that breathes with scene needs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains purposeful. Minor synonym churn around ice/glacier/frozen vocabulary, though mostly justified by the setting's constraints.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer concept offers genuine freshness, combining underwater archaeology with supernatural communication through ice as medium. The nested snow-globe recursion and dream-cameo analysis create non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure and metaphysical premise heightens stakes while maintaining clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
