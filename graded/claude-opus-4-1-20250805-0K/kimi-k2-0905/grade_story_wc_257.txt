<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mourning jewelry maker's grief-driven transformation is well-motivated, with concrete embodied details like "her fingers tracing the edge of a tattoo stencil." Her internal contradiction between preserving and accepting loss drives meaningful choices, particularly in the shift from "genuinely artificial" memorials to allowing transformation. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional summary ("subdued ardor manifested") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure - the protagonist's departure marks acceptance of transformation over preservation, with visible cost in leaving the observatory. The pattern of placing origami figures builds density toward the final reweighting of grief. Slight deduction for orientation arriving late (~120 words) though it serves the mysterious atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeless observatory functions as both setting and constraint, with specific details like "curtains of intention" woven from "unfinished dreams" creating atmospheric pressure. The celestial maps and mechanical orreries provide concrete anchors for the protagonist's actions. The setting actively shapes choices through its liminal nature and the coordinates system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake - transforming grief from preservation to acceptance - intensifies through the accumulation of origami placements, each carrying deeper meaning about "withering and blooming." The cost is legible in the final departure and the decade of solitude. Minor deduction as the pressure builds steadily rather than through sharp reversals, though this fits the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "genuinely artificial" paradox and the transformation of mourning craft into acceptance ritual. The final image of growing "around the shape of what we've lost" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Strong integration of death as continuation rather than ending, earned through specific details like the tattoo stencil coordinates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on craft details and transformation. Some elevated diction ("liminal space," "acoustic dome") fits the otherworldly setting. Deduction for occasional register drift into abstract philosophical language that slightly weakens the embodied voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "coordinates" and "origami figures," some abstract scaffolding ("essential truth"), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages about transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mourning jewelry craft with metaphysical observatory creates an original frame for grief exploration. The "genuinely artificial" paradox and the coordinates system linking memory to cosmic location show ingenuity. The transformation from preservation to acceptance through paper messengers offers a non-obvious angle on familiar grief narratives.</comment>
