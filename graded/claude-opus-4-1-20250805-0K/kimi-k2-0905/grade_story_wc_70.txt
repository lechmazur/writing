<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wonder drives her ascent and the lie she speaks at the climax, with embodied tension in "her hair lift, her booth keys levitate." The involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict when forced to lie. Minor deduction for the boy character appearing briefly without deeper pressure on Mara's choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the open gate and cryptic matchbox promise "wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest," reweighting the truthfulness constraint. The causal chain from riddle to ascent to lie to lightning strike coheres. Slight dock for the boy's unexplained disappearance and the queen bee's agency remaining opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower's copper rods, dead beehive chamber with "wax wings melted into golden puddles," and summit platform constrain Mara's path and enable the lightning strike. Setting details like "nectar dusk" and ionized air shape perception throughout. The environment directly enables closure when copper cones channel the bolt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine preservation through the riddle's challenge to the paradoxical demand to lie, with visible cost in "every coin in her apron leap out... newly etched with the silhouette of a bee." The tension between truthfulness and wonder-preservation forces the climactic choice. Minor issue: the boy's role lacks oppositional pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving wonder via transgression ("speak the lie that keeps you honest"), with the open gate inverting the toll-keeper role. The bee motif accumulates meaning from failed experiment to resurrection to etched coins. Slight deduction for the queen bee's message feeling somewhat imposed rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "sky bruise into nectar dusk" and "fragile varnish over wonder" maintains lyric consistency. POV control is clean with Mara's perceptual signature filtering the ionized atmosphere. The boy's dialogue carries appropriate mystery without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence structures and purposeful compression ("Dawn would bring engineers..."). Information density high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "nectar dusk" (3x) and some filter verbs ("felt her hair lift") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The involuntary truthfulness creating paradoxical wonder through lying offers a fresh angle. The lightning-collection tower with drone beehive experiment feels specific. However, the magical realism elements (coins orbiting, box snapping shut) lean toward familiar territory without full transformation.</comment>
