<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between remaining the station's "obliging sky mechanic" versus stepping into sideways time is embodied through concrete choices with the lever and nexus. The final decision to wait for ripeness while accepting her mechanical lungs as companionship rather than burden shows genuine character evolution with visible cost—she chooses the version who stays knowing what she sacrifices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure through Charged Poise: the protagonist crystallizes her understanding of sideways time and chooses to remain in her current timeline, with the cost visible in her awareness of the "green moon" alternative where she dies with untouched lungs. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of repetition ("every evening," "tomorrow she would come again") build to reweight her nightly ritual from obligation to choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and aviary create a vivid xenobiology station atmosphere, with moth-bats' "glassy pinions" and "subsonic hum" providing strong sensory detail. The "violet cloud-sea of Kepler-9c" and twilight corridors establish an otherworldly setting that constrains choices—the protagonist's mechanical lungs tie her physically to the station, making her departure a genuine sacrifice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening revelation rather than external conflict: from routine evening walk to nexus interaction to witnessing sideways time to choosing her path with full knowledge of alternatives. The cost is unmistakable—she sees herself "die of old age on a green moon, lungs untouched by metal" yet chooses to stay, accepting her role as the station's keeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chrysalis metaphor beautifully unifies the piece: "the station was such a chrysalis, and she its reluctant imago, kept in perpetual twilight by her own refusal to finish becoming." The final image of choosing "night after night, within the hush of beating wings at rest" reweights the opening's routine as deliberate stasis rather than trapped obligation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("the obliging sky mechanic who insisted that half-light kept the specimens calm") and strong perceptual signature in how the protagonist experiences the station as a living entity. Some register elevation in places ("subsonic hum that vibrated the titanium ribs") but generally maintains consistency with the xenobiologist-mechanic perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative imagery ("moved like chilled honey," "the air thickened into a prism") though occasional density of metaphor approaches overwriting ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but some conceptual redundancy exists around the sideways time concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel and body modification themes through the specific lens of a xenobiology station where the protagonist's prosthetic lungs create both bondage and belonging. The sideways time concept, while not wholly original, gains specificity through the moth-bat chrysalis parallel and the choice to remain incomplete rather than emerge.</comment>
