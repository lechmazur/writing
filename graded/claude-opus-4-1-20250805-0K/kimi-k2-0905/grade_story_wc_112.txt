I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and recursive time loops toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts her hybrid nature.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between wanting to prove sideways time (escape her choice) versus accepting her mechanical symbiosis plays out through embodied details like the "mechanically warm" lungs breathing "with her instead of for her." The final choice to remain the "obliging sky mechanic" shows earned acceptance with visible cost - she sees alternate lives but chooses this chrysalis state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Charged Poise closure crystallizes her options - step into alternate timelines or remain in perpetual twilight - with the cost felt in "the angle of her next footstep, slightly offset." The accumulative structure coheres as moth-bat patterns, nexus pulses, and time-sideways imagery converge at the lever scene, though the extended reflection sequence (lines 7-17) slightly dilutes present-moment pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station-as-chrysalis and moth-bats-as-time-markers constrain her choices throughout - she must work within twilight, touch the nexus nightly, operate the lever by degrees. The "icy warmth" in her mechanical lungs becomes companionship rather than discomfort, showing how the setting has literally become part of her body and shapes her final acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The escalation builds through accumulation: nexus throbbing faster → lever engagement → holographic projections → time tilting sideways → stepping outside timeline → returning transformed. The cost manifests in her conscious choice to delay emergence ("when the moment was ripe"), though the middle section's reflection could have maintained more present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chrysalis metaphor perfectly reweights the entire piece - the station, herself, and the moth-bats all exist in "subdued awakenings," refusing full emergence. The final image of "quiet repetition of choice, night after night" transforms routine into deliberate postponement of metamorphosis, making her mechanical lungs both prison and companion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent dream-logic ("time moves sideways," "the station's own mechanically warm bellows") with purposeful compression that teaches its pattern early. The perceptual signature - focusing on magnetic pulses, wing-beats, and thermal contradictions - creates a distinct texture, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("holographic principles encoded").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control in passages like "she saw the moth-bats leave the aviary, evolve into sky-whales" creates propulsion, but abstract phrases like "holographic principles" and "subdued awakenings" occasionally obscure concrete action. The recurring "mechanically warm" and wing imagery provides textural coherence, though some sentences could compress further for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-travel with biological metamorphosis feels fresh - proving time's sideways movement through refusing to complete one's own transformation. The specific detail of prosthetic lungs that make her "forever obliging to the sky" grounds the abstract concept in embodied consequence, avoiding generic sci-fi time-loop territory.</comment>
