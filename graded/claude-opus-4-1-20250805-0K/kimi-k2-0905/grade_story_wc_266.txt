<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters pursue clear goals (finding the hound, restoring balance) with embodied stress and consistent traits. The hound's internal crisis mirrors human travelers' struggles effectively. However, emotional progression feels somewhat abstract ("unused courage waits") and lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, particularly during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the hound's self-chosen duty, with clear cost (freedom vs. purpose). The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery and repetition build toward the hound's recognition that courage exists within. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for somewhat abstract conceptual cost rather than visceral dramatization at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway functions as more than backdrop—its shifting, fracturing nature mirrors and constrains the search. Strong sensory work with "ethereal paw prints that appeared and vanished like breath on cold glass." Setting actively shapes choices as paths "twisted back upon themselves." Missing full constraint at the crucial confrontation moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on restoring cosmic balance through finding the guardian. Pressure builds through the journey's increasing disorientation and the hound's mournful howl. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost—the hound's choice feels predetermined rather than fought for, and no concrete price is paid for the restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the journey structure: external searching for what exists within. The star stamps, leash symbolism, and "indirect routes" motif coherently support this without heavy-handed moralizing. Final image of the hound's transformed howl resonantly reweights the opening crisis. Slight abstraction in "unused courage" prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited through Marta's perception with clean focalization. Strong perceptual signature in how ferry guides notice ethereal details others might miss. Voice maintains mythic register appropriately. Dialogue feels slightly formal but fits the otherworldly context. Some filter verb accumulation ("understanding that," "knowing that") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong atmospheric control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, template repetition appears ("They walked," "They found," "Jun stepped") and abstract phrasing like "unused courage" recurs without concrete grounding. Final paragraph truncation suggests generation artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The psychopomp ferry guide concept offers fresh mythology, avoiding standard afterlife tropes. The hound as lost guardian rather than threat subverts expectations. However, the resolution's abstraction ("courage unused simply waits for recognition") trends toward template wisdom rather than earned specificity. The incomplete final sentence confirms derivative elements.</comment>
