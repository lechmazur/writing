<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization through Marta's weathered wisdom and Jun's youthful perception, with the hound's crisis mirroring human travelers' search for courage. The moment when the hound realizes "the courage she'd sought outside herself had been within all along" carries genuine emotional weight. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("unused courage") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the hound chooses duty over freedom, with visible cost in her "mournful howl" transforming to "welcoming." The accumulative lens holds as the guides' patient persistence mirrors the hound's journey to self-recognition. Strong causality from leash breaking through search to voluntary return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway effectively shifts and fractures to mirror the guardian's crisis, with paths "existing in multiple directions simultaneously." Setting actively constrains choices as guides must follow "ethereal paw prints" through twisted routes. Some generic atmosphere ("mist-shrouded," "amber pools") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Central stake of restoring cosmic balance escalates from disrupted crossings to the hound's existential crisis, resolved through Jun's star-stamp marking her as "partner" not property. The "indirect routes" motif meaningfully shapes how characters navigate both physical and emotional terrain. Cost is visible in the hound's journey from desperation to acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the parallel between guides shepherding souls and the hound learning that bondage was actually chosen purpose. The final image of the hound taking "her position at the shoreline, no longer bound by leash but by choice" resonates without stating its moral about internal versus external courage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent mythic-lyrical voice with controlled distance, though some passages drift into elevated register ("liminal shore," "ethereal paw prints"). The "shoreline lullaby" tone effectively modulates from ominous searching to peaceful resolution. Perceptual signatures could be more distinct between Marta and Jun.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("unused courage" appears 4 times, "indirect routes" 3 times). Template cadence in middle section with repetitive "They [verb]" structures. Strong final image partially redeems: "lanterns swinging in practiced arcs."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychopomp mythology with the guardian-becomes-lost trope, particularly the insight that cosmic duties are chosen rather than imposed. The fractured landscape reflecting internal crisis adds originality. Some stock fantasy elements (ancient guardian, crossing between worlds) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
