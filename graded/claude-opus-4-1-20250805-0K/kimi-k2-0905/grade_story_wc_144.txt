I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for literary publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Lira diagnoses and repairs the drone under time pressure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation and blindness create genuine constraints that shape her methods throughout. The drone's "Morse of fear" and Lira teaching it to "translate terror into torque" show sophisticated character-object parallel. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated moments like "magnetic calm" being stated rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from diagnosis through repair to launch, with clear cost (village waiting for medicine). The closure lands with the drone reaching the ship - a Decisive Change with visible stakes. Slight deduction for the convenience of Col's perfectly timed color reports without showing his learning curve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The water-light refraction system brilliantly constrains Lira's choices and creates a unique sensory world. "Copper bleeding into violet" and the rain barrel's "restless confetti" show exceptional specificity. The depot's ambient sounds serve as functional anchors throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Time pressure from the Aurora's departure creates genuine urgency that tightens through "seven minutes" to launch. The drone's trauma creating a feedback loop adds unexpected complication. Slightly formulaic in how smoothly the resolution proceeds once the method is found.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of translating "feedback into direction" emerges organically through Lira's blindness, the drone's panic, and the repair process. The parallel between Lira's post-explosion recovery and teaching the drone resonates without being stated. Final image of "artificial star" meeting ship carries thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Lira's light-reading creates unique POV texture. Some moments trend toward over-explanation ("To decode feedback into direction, she must teach..."). Dialogue is functional but Col's voice lacks distinction beyond nervousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hummingbird drone whose glass wings had cracked" and "lumen-veins that guided its flight" show strong specificity. However, several abstract phrases like "magnetic calm" appear twice, and some sentences over-explain rather than trust the image. The prose is competent but occasionally reaches for poetry without earning it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blind artisan reading repairs through water-refracted light is genuinely fresh. The drone developing trauma from its crash adds unexpected depth. The synthesis of disability, synesthesia-like perception, and mechanical empathy creates something memorable despite familiar workshop elements.</comment>
