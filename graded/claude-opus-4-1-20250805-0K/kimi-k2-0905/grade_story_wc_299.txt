<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between clinging to past glory and building new purpose drives authentic tension, with the speaker cloth serving as a physical anchor for her emotional state. The shift from passive resignation to active engagement (calling the school) shows genuine character movement with visible cost—she must accept her diminished status to find new meaning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's acceptance that "being needed" matters more than applause, with the workshop call crystallizing this shift. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (diesel smell, limestone dust, echo valley acoustics) build toward her stance change, though the cost could be more visceral in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry setting functions as both physical space and emotional metaphor—the "echo valley" acoustics mirror her relationship with past applause while limestone's "mineral promise of foundations" signals future building. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (the crusher as snare hit), though some descriptions lean toward the symbolic rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure—tightens when Mara discovers the orange paint speck and realizes "being needed" trumps applause. However, the resolution through a phone call lacks the visceral pressure of earlier beats; the transformation feels slightly too neat given the depth of her earlier despair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through concrete details—the grille cloth's evolution from relic to "tiny flag declaring war on resignation" reweights memory without stating morals. The final image of limestone dust tasting bitter but promising foundations offers non-literal resonance about building after loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The close third-person maintains consistent psychic distance with strong perceptual signature—Mara experiences sound through her roadie lens (crusher as snare hit, truck brakes as chords). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("fossilized dreams," "mineral promise") that slightly exceeds the character's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several passages contain mild redundancy ("quiet but waiting," "confidently uncertain" appears twice). The prose occasionally reaches for literary effect with mixed metaphors (sound wave "drooled" into flat line) that don't fully cohere with the dominant acoustic motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of roadie-turned-appraiser finding purpose through teaching audio science shows genuine transformation of familiar material. The specific detail of the orange paint speck in the grille cloth and the quarry-as-echo-chamber metaphor elevate beyond template, though the resolution through volunteering is somewhat expected.</comment>
