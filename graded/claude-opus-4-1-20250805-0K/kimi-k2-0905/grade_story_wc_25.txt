<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Both characters have clear motivations rooted in inheritance and professional expertise, with Mira's seven years of experience contrasting effectively against the academic visitor's unfamiliarity. The discovery moment earns its resonance through accumulated detail about whisper acoustics and wartime history. Minor deduction for the visitor's somewhat convenient arrival timing and Mira's quick trust of a stranger in restricted areas.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the storm, maps, and acoustic discoveries building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth's true purpose as a whisper network is revealed. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the realization that Mira's maps were incomplete because she'd been navigating by sight rather than sound. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains navigation (GPS failure) and enables the acoustic discovery, with sensory detail filtering through Mira's professional expertise ("metallic whisper," "corrugated corridors"). The geomagnetic storm's violet ribbons and electrical interference create atmosphere while serving plot function. The seven-corridor star pattern and acoustic chamber specificity elevate the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from navigation challenge to historical mystery to fundamental misunderstanding of the labyrinth's purpose, with the storm creating temporal pressure. The acoustic discovery reweights Mira's professional knowledge with visible cost—her maps were incomplete. Slight deduction for the convenient alignment of storm, inheritance, and Mira's presence, though the "calculated spontaneity" framing partially justifies this.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whisper network discovery—quiet voices traveling farther than shouts resonates against wartime secrecy and modern satellite dependence. The zodiac coins and keys accumulate meaning without heavy-handed symbolism. Final realization about navigation by sound rather than sight offers a non-literal answer to why some knowledge remains hidden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's professional voice filters perception effectively ("trained ear identified the walk," "deliberately pitched low"), with some texture in technical observations. Dialogue carries subtext about trust and discovery without over-explaining. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("calculated spontaneity of the moment") and the visitor's voice lacking distinction beyond education markers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in shorter observations ("Looking for someone?") contrasting with longer descriptive passages. Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive "whispered" constructions, some filter-heavy passages ("Mira felt," "Mira understood"), and occasional overwrought phrasing ("intersection of her maps, this stranger's inheritance").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of industrial setting with acoustic mystery, transforming the familiar shipping container maze into a communication device. The whisper network concept and navigation-by-sound revelation feel earned and non-obvious. The wartime history adds authentic depth without becoming pure historical fiction.</comment>
