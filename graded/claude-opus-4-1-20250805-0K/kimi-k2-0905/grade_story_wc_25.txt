I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against publishability standards.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered revelations about the labyrinth's acoustic properties, with density increasing toward the discovery of the whisper network's true purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's expertise and careful observation create believable motivation, particularly her ability to read walks and navigate by sound. The woman's inherited quest feels slightly convenient, but both characters make concrete micro-choices (testing whisper theory, following acoustic maps) that reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction appears when Mira shifts from skepticism to understanding, though the transition could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Mira realizes the labyrinth is an acoustic machine, not just storage—this reweights all her prior mapping work with visible conceptual cost ("her maps had been incomplete"). The accumulative structure builds through sound details toward this discovery. Orientation anchors effectively (port, storm, containers), and the pattern of whispers-over-shouts pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth's acoustic properties constrain choices throughout—GPS failure forces hand-drawn maps, whispers must be used instead of shouts, the seven-corridor junction creates specific spatial pressure. The geomagnetic storm actively shapes navigation and discovery timing. Sensory hierarchy emphasizes sound over sight, fitting Mira's expertise, though some container descriptions feel generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from navigation challenge to proving a wartime communication system, with the storm creating temporal pressure. The whisper network discovery deepens rather than reverses, changing knowledge about the labyrinth's purpose. Cost appears when Mira confronts her incomplete understanding despite seven years of expertise, though the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whisper/shout contrast, gaining layers as wartime secrets and quiet resistance are revealed. The final realization that "quietest voices travel farthest" resonates without moralizing, reweighting Mira's technical knowledge with historical purpose. The zodiac coins and keys accumulate meaning across eras without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision through Mira's POV, with perceptual focus on sound and movement patterns. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext ("Looking for someone?" tests rather than confronts). Some filter verbs appear ("Mira felt," "realized") but don't overwhelm immediacy. The woman's voice could be more distinct from Mira's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence rhythms, particularly in passages about sound traveling through metal. Information density is high without overwriting. Minor issues: "calculated spontaneity of the moment" tells rather than shows, some container descriptions recycle similar phrasing, and "understanding flooding her features" is clichéd. No loops or scaffolding that harm momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The acoustic labyrinth concept freshly combines maintenance work, wartime history, and communication theory. Specific details (triangular key, whisper network, seven-corridor junction) avoid generic port settings. The transformation of industrial infrastructure into a deliberate acoustic machine offers genuine surprise that feels earned through established details.</comment>
