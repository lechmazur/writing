I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia-as-lantern motivation compels her mural creation with embodied exhaustion ("eyes felt rinsed by moonlight"). The contradiction between fatigue and methodical hope drives authentic choices. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("remembered kindness remained, soft as pollen") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the greenhouse transforms into "a lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood," with visible cost in Mira's seventeen-hour collapse. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern teaching (lost languages in objects, kindness as contagion). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-lung constrains and enables the core action, with sensory density ("peat and saffron quiet," "turmeric she sprinkled"). The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Setting actively shapes choices through the cracked mirror's positioning and the fire escape's vertical journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: each glyph thickens air until "the greenhouse felt like the inside of a throat learning to speak." Cost is visible in Mira's exhaustion and the "abolished tongue" risk. The deepening from personal art to communal breathing shows clear progression under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lost languages/remembered kindness synthesis without stating morals. The final image of "marigolds tucked into windshield wipers" resonantly answers the central question about whether strangers remember kindness. Subtext operates through the calligrapher's brush history and Jules's wordless understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyric elevation ("moon silvered the glass panes and turned the trapped ivy into lace"). Some register drift in peak moments ("exhaling syllables that slipped into open windows") slightly dulls POV consistency. Strong rhythmic control maintains saffron quiet tone throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("her insomnia now a lantern"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("soft as pollen," "seed-like") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in "She realized... She descended... She slept" sequence. Prose generally propulsive with varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost languages hiding in objects with urban kindness as contagion feels fresh and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity. The greenhouse-as-lung transformation and collective breathing offer genuine ingenuity beyond template magical realism.</comment>
