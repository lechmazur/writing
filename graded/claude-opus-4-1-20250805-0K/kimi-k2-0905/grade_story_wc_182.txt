<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to steal unlearned lessons to prevent war is clear and compelling, with concrete micro-choices like trading her future year for the time traveler's life. The botanical diary as an emotional map and her methodical resourcefulness create consistent characterization. Minor deduction for the time traveler's underdeveloped agency and some abstract phrasing around "unlearned lessons" that occasionally drifts toward concept rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with linguistic and botanical imagery building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara releases absences into the world. The cost is visible: she trades a year of her life, and the library's lessons disperse as "second thoughts" to prevent future errors. The hybrid magical-realist world rules remain consistent throughout, though the precise mechanics of "folding absences" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain functions as both setting and constraint, with corridors as staff lines and stairs as glossaries that actively shape navigation. The botanical diary's ink-flowers that respond to synonyms and the root-walls spelling warnings create a lived-in magical space. Peak moment: the library door requiring "a word no language had ever spoken" directly constrains the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving unlearned lessons to prevent war—escalates through the time traveler's crystalline suspension and the linguistic cipher blocking the library. Elara's sacrifice of a life-year creates genuine cost. The tension between helping the traveler versus accessing the library forces a meaningful trade-off, though the resolution feels slightly neat with both goals achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of learning from absences ("gaps speak louder than what remains") resonates through concrete images like transparent books of mistakes and seeds dispersing as second thoughts. The final image of historians hearing cello chords in dreams elegantly reweights the "unheard symphony" without stating a moral. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction around "unlearned lessons" that verges on conceptual convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges botanical and linguistic registers naturally ("night-blooming clematis unfurled," "suspended in a crystal paragraph"). The perceptual signature—Elara experiencing language as physical space and emotion as flora—remains consistent under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm accelerates during the rescue sequence while maintaining clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("descended a staircase disguised as a glossary"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("crystal paragraph," "comma slicing his wrist") serves the magical-realist mode but occasionally strains clarity. Minor repetition of "carefully resourceful" and slight overuse of botanical-linguistic fusion metaphors, though these support rather than obscure the pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics, botany, and time travel into a rescue mission for civilization's forgotten wisdom is fresh and specific. The botanical diary mapping emotions to seeds and the library of unlearned lessons as preventive medicine show genuine ingenuity. The image of absences drifting toward cities as "second thoughts" offers a non-obvious take on how societies learn.</comment>
