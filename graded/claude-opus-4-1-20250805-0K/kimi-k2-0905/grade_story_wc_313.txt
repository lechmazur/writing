<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's internal contradiction between duty and personal grief drives authentic choices, particularly in her decision to destroy the label while creating new documentation. The moment of recognizing her father's alternate life creates genuine emotional complexity without therapy-speak resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as Marisol follows the photograph trail to a resonant reconfiguration where she transforms from solitary guardian to communal storyteller, with visible cost in tearing the label "into tiny blue flakes." The closure lands but the middle section's photograph discovery could tighten causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drowned town emerging "one deliberate foot per day" and specific details like "art-deco sign still attached to a wall that had once been the third floor" create vivid spatial reality. Setting constrains choices through the physical descent and silt-filled rooms, though the ridgeway itself could be more precisely rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling personal history with communal duty—deepens through the photograph trail leading to father's secret, forcing Marisol's choice between private grief and public service. Escalation is present but relies more on accumulation than decisive tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between "stories we'll never tell" and Marisol's final act of creating "shared memory: a museum of common loss and common survival." The sapphire liqueur label's destruction and the restrung wind chime create resonant bookends without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "twilight that clung to the midnight ridgeway like damp gauze." Voice modulates appropriately from controlled observation to emotional recognition, though some passages edge toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "each scrap carrying the weight of a private grief she could finally release," though occasional density issues appear ("the mirrored hush inside her chest"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drowned town as palimpsest of memory offers a fresh angle on loss and recovery, particularly in transforming surveillance duty into curatorial work. The specific detail of the Sapphire Swan lounge and arranged photographs prevents generic treatment, though the resolution trends somewhat safe.</comment>
