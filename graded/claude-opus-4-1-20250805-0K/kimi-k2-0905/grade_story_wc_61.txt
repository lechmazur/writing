<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal conflict between inherited duty and the desire to break generational patterns drives authentic choices, particularly when he chooses "transmission over rooted sorrow." The embodied handling of the gear and his physical response to the garden create concrete characterization. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("nostalgia for places he had never stood") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Kael breaks the generational pattern by choosing to become "a courier of cool radiance," with visible cost (leaving the gear behind, accepting exile). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the beacon discovery and final transformation. Orientation anchors effectively establish the nebula garden setting and Kael's role within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden functions as both setting and constraint, with crystalline paths, falling petals, and the buried beacon all shaping Kael's choices. Sensory details ("pollen that glittered like crushed diamonds," "brass teeth warm against his palms") are selective and purposeful. The environment actively participates in the closure when "every blossom began to glow from within."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking free from generational patterns of sacrifice—escalates through Kael's discovery of the beacon and his choice to transmit rather than root. Cost is visible when he feels "the crack destined for his own heart seal" and leaves the gear behind. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as patterns deepen toward the transformative choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between inheritance and innovation, with the gear's "impossible ratio" serving as a concrete metaphor for breaking infinite cycles. The final image of "widening spirals" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively through the garden's responses and the beacon's hidden light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-scientific register appropriate to the otherworldly setting, with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("quiet sigh of falling petals"). Some filter constructions ("Kael felt," "He understood") slightly dull immediacy in key moments. The perceptual signature effectively filters the garden through Kael's sentimentalist lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both atmosphere and stakes. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("troubling serenity" repeated without variation) and some filter-verb clustering in emotional beats. The final image of "widening spirals" effectively recharges the circular motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of light-sharing without fire offers a fresh angle on generational sacrifice narratives, with the gear's mathematical impossibility adding specificity. The synthesis of scientific language with emotional stakes creates memorable texture. The resolution—becoming a wave that carries the break—transforms the expected pattern of cyclic tragedy.</comment>
