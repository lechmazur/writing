<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between Lila's withdrawal symptoms and her methodical pursuit, with the accordion as a concrete link to father's failures creating layered motivation. The final choice to release the accordion into the stream demonstrates genuine cost and transformation, though some interior passages edge toward therapy-speak ("Forgiveness, she realized, was not a destination but a bearing").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently with the underground journey serving as both literal descent and metaphorical excavation of guilt. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lila releases the accordion and accepts navigation over erasure, with visible cost in letting go of her father's instrument. Minor orientation delay (who Lila is takes time to clarify) and some causal looseness around how the stream "shows" her memories deduct slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underground chamber with its weeping walls and glinting mica creates a liminal space that enables transformation, while the ivy-choked platform frames entry/exit. Setting constrains choice when Lila must descend into darkness and step into the cold stream. The graffiti wisdom becomes a physical catalyst for discovery, elevating setting beyond mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from mapping external springs to confronting internal guilt, with the underground stream forcing physical immersion that mirrors emotional reckoning. The choice to release the accordion demonstrates agency with clear cost. However, the transformation feels slightly predetermined rather than fought for—Lila's internal resistance could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Water as memory/erosion metaphor develops consistently through underground discovery to the final understanding of forgiveness as navigation rather than destination. The graffiti line "The water remembers what the banks forget" crystallizes theme through concrete discovery. Slight deduction for the explicit realization about forgiveness that edges toward stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges map-maker's precision ("daringly methodical") with withdrawal's hypersensitivity ("pulsed too bright, too loud"). The perceptual signature—counting paces like pills, aligning objects with compass points—remains consistent. Minor register drift in philosophical passages ("Forgiveness, she realized, was not a destination but a bearing") contrasts with otherwise grounded narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("salt meeting fresh water, guilt meeting current"), but several template constructions appear ("She walked," "She stepped," "She left," "She climbed"). The philosophical realization paragraph contains abstract summary that could be more embodied. Information density is good but uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely transit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a "truth-seeking river chronicler" pursuing underground springs for personal absolution offers fresh specificity. The accordion as inherited burden/instrument of release and the bathroom graffiti as wisdom source show inventive detail. The lithium withdrawal frame grounds the heightened perception convincingly, though the forgiveness-as-navigation insight feels less surprising.</comment>
