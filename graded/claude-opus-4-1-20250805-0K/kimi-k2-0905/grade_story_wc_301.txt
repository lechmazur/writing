<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between documenting/measuring and needing to release control drives genuine change, with the twelve-year-old's frozen moment earning the final forgiveness through accumulated detail. The accordion as inherited burden transforms into "absolution" through concrete play, not declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through obsessive documentation toward the paper boat release and accordion's "air release" as Earned Stasis—forgoing the maps for direct acceptance. Cost is visible in "withdrawal tremor" and the coiled rope memory that anchors the entire piece.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivy-consumed station constrains movement ("every root stepped aside") and mirrors internal overgrowth, while the accordion's "fraying tape that once held my father's cigarettes" carries lived-in specificity. River geography shapes every choice from the drowning to the final listening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation reads through accumulated weight—from pill dissolution through map-making to playing the accordion to releasing the paper boat, each gesture forecloses the obsessive chronicling path. The "twelve-year-old who feared the rope more than the loss" crystallizes the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The graffiti "Forgiveness is a bridge you build by walking backward with your eyes closed" reweights the entire mapping enterprise, while the final unfinished sentence ("For the first time, the") suggests ongoing process over resolution. Theme emerges through concrete acts, not statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in "notebook damp with river mist" and "fox musk" with rhythmic control that mirrors emotional state—long accumulative sentences breaking into "I did not look back." Some filter verbs ("felt") in early sections slightly reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines like "ivy had swallowed the station whole, green fingers prying apart brick and memory alike" doing triple work. Minor repetition of "daringly methodical" and occasional abstract phrasing ("green testament") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bathroom graffiti as wisdom source and the accordion-as-penitent's-cross transform expected grief narrative through specific texture. The unfinished final sentence takes a risk that mostly succeeds, though the meditation-withdrawal frame edges toward familiar recovery territory.</comment>
