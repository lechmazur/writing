<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's insomnia functions as both literal condition and metaphor for necessary vigilance, with her exhaustion embodied through "raw eyes" and physical details. The exchange with the old woman reveals layered motivations beyond surface barter, and Mara's final transformation from burden to gift shows earned change through concrete experience. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient emotional resolution in the final line after months of insomnia.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through rain trails, shell spirals, and monastery imagery that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's insomnia transforms from curse to gift. The closure lands with felt cost through the exchange of painting for spring water and the acceptance of vigilance as necessary witness. Slight deduction for the overly neat sleep resolution that feels unearned given the established chronic condition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal island and monastery function as active constraints, with the causeway controlling access and rain trails literally guiding movement. Vivid sensory work in "basalt causeway stones," "monastery's transformation from sacred space to tidal artifact," and the amber brooch's warmth responding to hidden patterns. The setting actively shapes choices and the water wars' aftermath permeates every detail, creating a lived-in post-apocalyptic world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding meaning after collapse escalates through the exchange from material goods to recognition to artistic creation, with each stage deepening understanding. The painting becomes the vehicle for transformation, and the spring water exchange carries genuine cost as "water that had never been touched by the wars." Slight weakness in the convenience of finding exactly the right person with the right wisdom at the right moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the convergence motif—monastery as "breathing thing, half-earth, half-sea," the amber brooch bridging geological time, and art as meaning-making after catastrophe. The "thresh meaning from experience" drive gains depth through concrete exchanges rather than abstract philosophizing. The final image of microscopic life evolving in the new world offers a non-literal answer about adaptation and continuity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and strong perceptual signature in how Mara notices patterns and artistic details. Some effective free indirect moments like "Another dawn, another failure" capture her voice. Deduction for occasional register drift into overly polished observations ("microscopic life that would evolve to thrive") that exceed the exhausted painter's likely articulation and for dialogue that occasionally sounds written rather than spoken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with some strong images like "defeated army" for the tide and "broken tooth" for the monastery. However, several instances of overwriting ("haggard awe burning in her chest"), abstract phrasing ("unearthed convergence of past and present"), and the final paragraph's shift to elevated register about evolution and species-level observations. Some repetitive constructions around "understanding" and "meaning" that could be compressed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The post-water-wars setting with memory trading offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic fiction, moving beyond survival to meaning-making. The specific detail of monks cataloguing tides whose "careful measurements now meaningless" adds originality. However, the mentor-figure encounter and artistic epiphany follow familiar patterns, and the resolution through art-as-understanding doesn't fully transform the template.</comment>
