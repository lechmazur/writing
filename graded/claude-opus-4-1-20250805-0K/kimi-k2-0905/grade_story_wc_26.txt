I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve hope crystallizes through concrete actions—cataloguing dusks, comparing footage, ultimately becoming the dusk itself. Her internal contradiction between scholarly preservation and daughterly promise drives the metamorphosis. The final choice to house hope within her own vanishing carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation into "the last dusk itself," with clear cost ("her own vanishing"). The accumulative structure builds through stone warming → footage comparison → metamorphosis → final absorption, each beat reweighting the preservation of hope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library's orchid-walls that "exhaled their evening perfume" and later release "archived dreams like pollen" create a living setting that actively participates in the transformation. The river stone's evolution from "matte gray" to "tiny planet" with "continents of silver regret and oceans of gold hope" constrains and enables the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving hope's unshareable shape—intensifies from passive cataloguing to active metamorphosis. The stone's warming initiates escalation; comparing footage deepens understanding; the final internalization forecloses all other paths with clear cost ("became the last dusk itself").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme emerges through the contrast between shareable dreams that can be "edited into optimism and monetized" versus hope preserved in stone, unshareable but authentic. The final image of Mira as "violet afterimage" that makes dreamers wake "wondering why they felt both loss and lightness" offers a non-literal answer about preservation through sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled distance, though occasionally veers toward abstraction ("shadow unbound stirred inside her chest like a second heart"). The perceptual signature—focusing on light, color, and botanical imagery—remains coherent throughout, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The sharp-eyed dusk noticer closed her eyes and began to record the final dusk of her career"). However, abstract phrases like "hope was a shape that could be lost" and occasional register elevation ("luminous regret") create mild opacity without teaching their pattern early enough.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-sharing technology with ancient preservation instincts offers a fresh angle on memory and commodification. The specific detail of "silent video footage from decades apart" and the stone becoming "a tiny planet" with geographic features of emotion creates memorable particularity.</comment>
