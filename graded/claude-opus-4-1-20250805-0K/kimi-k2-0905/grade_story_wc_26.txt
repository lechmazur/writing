<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses between preservation and release act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she considers dropping the stone through clouds but instead absorbs it. The final choice to vanish into her own archive is earned through prior causality, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("shadow unbound") that resists embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Mira's self-archiving forecloses her path with visible cost—becoming "violet afterimage" future dreamers glimpse. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through metamorphosis sequences, though the "shadow unbound" remains conceptually vague throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming library's orchid-walls that exhale perfume and release archived dreams create a vivid, constraining environment that shapes Mira's final choice. However, the drowned world below lacks specificity beyond being "drowned," missing texture that would ground the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the stone's warming, its metamorphosis into a tiny planet, and Mira's recognition that hope must remain unshareable—each deepening narrows her options toward self-erasure. The cost is legible when she becomes "the last dusk itself," though middle pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ending offers resonant answer to preserving hope's shape: Mira becomes the preservation itself, folding into "one story no algorithm could compress." Theme emerges through concrete metamorphosis rather than statement, though "luminous regret" appears as explicit label multiple times.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in Mira's precise cataloguing of dusk shades and her awareness of endings others miss. Voice maintains lyric control through pressure, though occasional register drift ("algorithm could compress," "monetized") strains against the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("night air tasted of rain that would never fall again") with strong information density. However, "shadow unbound" repetition without clarification creates opacity, and "softly, deliberately" appears verbatim twice, suggesting template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological loss, dream commodification, and archival preservation creates non-obvious premise that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking through the self-erasure ending and metamorphic logic heightens stakes, though "shadow unbound" concept remains safely abstract.</comment>
