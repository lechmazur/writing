I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Alden's spoken words seal the fracture and transform the wasteland.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alden's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—catching soot in his palms, feeling its "sting of regret"—and his final choice to speak carries visible cost after years of silence. The child ghost's arrival and her offering of unspoken words deepens his burden convincingly. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the "tangled covenant" that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Alden breaks his vow of silence to seal the fracture, with the desert responding through blooming clover scent—a clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure builds pressure through the child's arrival, the fracture's discovery, and Alden's choice, all cohering under the textural lens. Who/where/when anchored early through "abandoned beekeeping oasis" and ritual timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box constrains Alden's central choice—its fracture forces him to either abandon or preserve the unspoken words. Environmental details like "sun-cracked frames," "toppled apiaries," and the transformation of wasteland to clover-scented air directly shape the story's resolution. The oasis functions as both physical setting and metaphysical crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: the child's arrival intensifies the weight in Alden's chest, the fracture creates urgency, and his final choice between staying or leaving crystallizes with clear stakes. The cost manifests in breaking his years-long vow. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the middle could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the preservation of unspoken words and the covenant between living and dead, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the sealed box gleaming "like a lantern" while desert flowers bloom offers a non-literal answer about memory, witness, and sacrifice. The honeycomb/bee motif threads throughout without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"motes of soot emerged, drifting like disappointed bees." POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature in how Alden reads the ghosts' "mute eloquence." Some elevated diction ("tranquilly perceptive" used three times) occasionally strains but mostly serves the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "bees of light swarming from her eyes" and effective rhythm variation. The repeated "tranquilly perceptive" creates intentional pattern but borders on mechanical. Some abstract phrasing ("tangled covenant," "mute eloquence") could be more concrete, though it doesn't obscure meaning. Information density high in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with beekeeping imagery creates an original emotional landscape. The concept of ghosts speaking through "motes of soot" and a glass box preserving unspoken words feels specific and earned. The transformation of preservation-as-burden into preservation-as-flowering offers a non-obvious resolution to the keeper's dilemma.</comment>
