I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and ritual repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Alden's breaking of silence transforms the covenant's meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alden's motivation is rooted in a clear covenant to preserve unspoken words, with his final choice to break silence earning its cost through accumulated weight. The child ghost's arrival forces a concrete micro-choice that reveals his values. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "tangled covenant" and occasional emotional summary rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Alden's spoken words seal the fracture and transform the wasteland, with visible cost in breaking his vow. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual repetition and deepening ghost encounters. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (the fire's role clarifies late) though this serves the textural design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box and apiary ruins constrain choices throughout - the fracture forces Alden's final decision, and the hive shell placement enables the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ash in spirals," "bruised horizon"). The setting actively shapes the resolution through its scorched-to-blooming arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fracture in the glass creates genuine escalation by threatening to release all preserved words, forcing Alden's choice between mending or abandoning. The child ghost's arrival deepens stakes by adding weight that could break the box entirely. Cost is visible in his broken vow, though the final transformation arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the preservation of unspoken words and the covenant as "comb" rather than chain. The final image of clover scent across wasteland resonantly answers the central question about holding versus releasing. Minor deduction for slightly explicit covenant explanation mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sun-cracked frames," "mute eloquence") that maintains consistency. Some filter-verb clusters in observation sections ("Alden watched," "noticed," "understood") reduce immediacy. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between tranquil observation and decisive action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with purposeful imagery, though some repetitive phrasing around "tranquilly perceptive" and abstract constructions like "tangled covenant" that resist concrete visualization. Strong opening and closing lines. Occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages ("bees of light swarming from her eyes") without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of ghosts carrying unspoken words in a post-apocalyptic beekeeping site offers fresh synthesis. The stained glass box as repository for verbal weight is inventive. The transformation from preserving to sharing these words provides a non-obvious resolution, though some elements feel purposefully literary.</comment>
