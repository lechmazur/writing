<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven obsession with finding answers crystallizes in her final realization that "grief obeys conservation laws," earning the closure through accumulated interiority and concrete actions like releasing the snow globe. Minor deduction for Fred (Death) reading more allegorical than embodied, though his patient companionship adds texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Mara's transformation from searching to releasing carries visible cost when she leaves her brother's tags in the library. The physics metaphor pays off conceptually ("ice becoming water becoming vapor") with earned wisdom about grief's conservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library's "cathedral of salt-stained books" and "chandelier of crystallized barnacles" create vivid underwater atmosphere that constrains movement and shapes the final image. Setting actively participates through the physicist's journal discovery and tidal movements affecting the snow globe's orbit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening understanding rather than external conflict—from finding Earhart's plane to recognizing her own search's futility to accepting grief's transformation. The snow globe's deliberate unsealing and repurposing with dog tags creates irreversible change with clear emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physics of memory and letting go, avoiding direct moralizing until the earned final recording. The physicist's equation about observers losing mass while the observed gains eternity reweights the entire search metaphor without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends scientific precision ("coefficient of release") with poetic observation ("books loosened their bindings and surrendered paragraphs"). Fred's dialogue maintains subtle otherworldliness while Mara's analytical nature colors perception throughout, though brief moments edge toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "the library to its quiet, sophisticated melancholy," but occasional density issues with stacked metaphors ("planet forming its own weather"). Some figurative language approaches purple ("cathedral of salt-stained books") without quite crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Death as companionable "Fred" offers fresh personification, while the sunken physics library housing equations about memory's thermodynamics creates original synthesis. The connection between Earhart's last transmission and personal grief frequency shows inventive parallel without forcing allegory.</comment>
