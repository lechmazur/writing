I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds pressure through layered sensory detail, pattern accumulation, and rhythmic intensification rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation to "convert calm into rhythm" drives consistent action through embodied ritual and sonic experimentation. His belief that "obstacles were only instruments not yet tuned" creates genuine character philosophy that shapes every choice. Minor deduction for limited interiority during the climactic drumming sequence where deeper access would strengthen the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "the obstacle become instrument, the silence become groove" crystallizes with visible cost (the Doldrum Wall's resistance overcome through collective effort). The accumulative structure coheres as sonic layers build toward breakthrough. Slight dock for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting operates as active constraint—the Doldrum Wall's "mirror stretched tight" forces invention, while the orchard-raft's materials (cedar, glass buoys, bamboo tubes) become instruments. The "blue hour" light creates consistent atmospheric pressure. The environment directly shapes tactics when "the faint wind the drumming had summoned" enables forward motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: sketching resonance → reading cloud-lyre warning → layering sounds → collective drumming → spiral reconfiguration. The Doldrum Wall provides genuine obstacle with "Engines of oar and sail failed." Cost manifests as collective effort required, though individual stakes could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of obstacle into instrument, never stated directly. The spiral motif (clouds → nautilus → movement pattern) creates recursive meaning. "He heard the obstacle become instrument" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of how to navigate stillness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent mythic-poetic register: "orchard drifted westward on its raft of lashed cedar," "clouds moved in slow arpeggios." Perceptual signature strong—the prophet experiences weather as music, silence as intervals. Rhythm control excellent under pressure, accelerating through shorter sentences during the drumming sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The tree answered with a low F sharp that traveled through cambium and salt-soaked root." Strong syntactic variety and propulsive rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("restless euphony" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphoric density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation-as-music with specific innovation: striking absence to "measure silent intervals," using harmonic overtones for propulsion. The cloud-reading as musical score and fractal-generating resonance create non-obvious conceptual framework. Risk-taking in the experimental structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
