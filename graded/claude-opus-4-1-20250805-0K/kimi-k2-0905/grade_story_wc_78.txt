I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered sonic patterns, rhythmic accumulation, and sensory density rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation to convert calm into rhythm is consistently embodied through concrete actions (striking objects, creating loops, conducting absence). His final non-smile while listening shows earned complexity - satisfaction without triumph. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "obstacles are only instruments not yet tuned."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the orchard transforms into orchestra, with visible cost in the prophet's sustained labor and the crew's participation. The piece coheres under the Accumulative lens with pattern-teaching and payoff. Deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting-as-instrument: the raft's physical components (barrels, stays, buoys, trees) become the means of propulsion. The Doldrum Wall as mirror and the spiral cloud formations constrain and enable action brilliantly. Setting literally shapes the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: solo strikes → looped fractals → crew participation → rotating crown of tubes. The obstacle (Doldrum Wall) genuinely threatens forward movement. The resolution through collective rhythm-making carries effort-cost but lacks a sharp trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of obstacle into instrument, never stated but enacted. The final line "heard the obstacle become instrument" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior percussion as creative problem-solving. Strong subtext in the prophet's methodical faith.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled musical vocabulary and synesthetic perception ("clouds moved in slow arpeggios"). POV maintains consistent perceptual signature of sound-as-navigation. Rhythm accelerates during the solution sequence, matching narrative pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language that serves the musical conceit. Strong syntactic variety and momentum. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("restless euphony" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphor density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of sailing narrative with music production/dubbing techniques. The solution through collective rhythm-making and sonic propulsion is genuinely inventive. Risk-taking in the experimental approach to maritime problem-solving heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
