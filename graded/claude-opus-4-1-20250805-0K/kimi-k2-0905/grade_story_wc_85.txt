<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's guilt manifests through concrete embodied details (blackened palms, the watch hand's weight) and contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene—manufacturing false memories while seeking her own truth. The final choice to cast away the rosary and accept balanced emptiness shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sieved hush") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's casting of the shell rosary and acceptance of balanced emptiness forecloses her path of guilt-accumulation with felt cost. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains causal linkage through the grain-reading to memory-manufacturing to final unburdening. Cost is legible in "pockets felt empty in a new way—not light, but balanced."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore create atmospheric pressure through selective detail ("bruised purple sky," "barnacle-scabbed wood"). The driftwood functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its grain must be read and rewritten. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from terrace to shore to cliff path. Minor deduction for some abstract atmospheric phrases that don't fully ground in physical detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's need to resolve guilt over her brother's death) signals early and tightens through the driftwood's response and shell revelation, forcing her final renunciation. The watch hand's unexpected "ticking" and bleeding seawater creates meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the casting away of her makeshift rosary and acceptance of emptiness as balance rather than void.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of manufactured memories versus withheld truths, with the "sieved hush" accumulating mass from lies until confession releases it. The final image of driftwood's false memories "sheltering barnacles" and "guilt carving a cradle" offers resonant non-literal answer about how even lies can create shelter. Brother revelation reweights all prior forgeries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with selective perception ("cobalt terrace," "granular silence") and controlled psychic distance that tightens during the brother confession. Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("cochlea of an ear," "arithmetic of guilt"). No dialogue to evaluate. Prose texture remains consistent through emotional intensification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong opening and several vivid lines ("sky bruised itself purple," "lies could shelter barnacles"). However, abstract phrases like "sieved hush" and "granular silence" appear multiple times without full dramatization, creating mild opacity. Some elevated register drift ("fermented," "abrade") that doesn't fully match POV. Information density is generally high but occasional abstraction dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The guilt-ridden genealogist who manufactures memories while unable to face her own offers fresh angle on forgery/authenticity. The specific detail of reading driftwood grain to create false childhoods shows originality. The synthesis of brother's death with career of erasure feels earned. Some conceptual abstractions ("sieved hush") lean toward over-cleverness without full payoff.</comment>
