<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve seeds and honor her grandmother's instructions is clear and consistent, with embodied emotional beats like "heart hammering yet breath steady." The transformation from seed-saver to "archivist of the moment after hatching" represents meaningful character evolution with visible cost (surrendering her heat molecule by molecule). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "furiously tranquil hunger" and "borrowed time" that occasionally veers toward the conceptual rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts her role as eternal guardian while the oak becomes a vortex doorway—a clear before/after with felt cost ("She would not pass through"). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through seed-scattering, heat surrender, and transformation sequences. The orientation anchors (seed saver, icebound atrium, after egg hatches) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the abstract "borrowed time" conceit which, while poetic, occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium setting actively constrains choices—ice must be melted through heat surrender, roots crack the floor seeking glacier water, the dome shatters to admit starlight. Vivid sensory detail ("frost-laced glass," "ice sliding free in sheets that shattered like bells") filtered through the protagonist's perspective. The micro-setting of the acorn cap with "tooth-marks of squirrels" adds specificity. Doesn't quite reach 8.0+ because some descriptions lean ornamental ("river of quiet fire") rather than consistently constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear escalation from discovering the hatched spiral through surrendering heat, planting precious seeds, to accepting eternal guardianship—each choice narrows future options with visible cost. The dominant stake (preserving the seed heritage/fulfilling grandmother's instructions) tightens as the protagonist realizes she must remain behind. The "furiously tranquil" tension between urgency and patience creates authentic pressure. Doesn't reach 8.0+ because some middle beats feel more accumulative than causally tight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of inheritance as both gift and debt ("Every inheritance is a debt; pay by planting what you cannot bear to lose"). The recurring seed/growth imagery gains resonance when the protagonist becomes a living archive. The final image of the dome as "snow-covered heart, beating once per century" offers a non-literal answer about patience and sacrifice across time. Subtext operates effectively through gesture (pressing seeds into soil) and silence (what's left unsaid about her future).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("starlight fracture across the dome like a promise breaking") and consistent third-person limited POV. The perceptual signature shows a seed-saver's attention to texture, time, and growth cycles. Some passages achieve excellent rhythm under pressure ("She felt furiously tranquil, heart hammering yet breath steady"). Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV plausibility ("chitin and endosperm") and abstract conceptual framing around "borrowed time."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Strong moments of concrete imagery ("leaves black-green, bark silver as starlight on snow"). However, the "borrowed time" conceit creates opacity through abstract metaphors ("velvet over iron, soft seconds draped across an unforgiving core") that don't fully clarify. Some ornamental language doesn't advance story ("river of quiet fire"). The piece maintains momentum but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving with cosmic/magical elements creates an original premise. The specific detail of squirrel tooth-marks on the acorn cap and Cherokee purple tomatoes grounds the fantastical. The transformation of wind-spiral into oak heartwood offers a non-obvious resolution. The concept of becoming a century-heartbeat guardian rather than passing through the vortex subverts expected hero's journey tropes. Risk-taking in the lyrical register mostly succeeds though occasionally obscures.</comment>
