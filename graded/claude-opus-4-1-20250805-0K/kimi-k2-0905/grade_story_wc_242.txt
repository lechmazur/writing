<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's cultivated estrangement and eventual choice to remain teaching "endings how to begin" while letting another go forward shows earned renunciation with visible cost. The child/woman caller relationship forces meaningful micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction between isolation and connection drives authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward abstract in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator steps beyond their loop while accepting their role as guide rather than traveler, with clear cost in the handed-over disc and foregone journey. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of loops, calls, and endings build toward the final reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchored early through underground booth setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground tunnel, glass harmonica disc, and maintenance gate all constrain choices and enable the final moment. Sensory details like "sodium light," "rusted grate," and "ink-dark" create atmosphere while the disc's physical properties (spinning, warming, singing) charge key beats. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from booth to gate and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of breaking isolation escalates through the child's calls, the reveal of her identity, and the choice at the gate. Agency manifests in both the decision to answer/engage and the final renunciation to remain. Cost is visible in the handed disc and the "soft finality" of the closing gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The loop metaphor evolves from prison to teaching tool, with the final image of walking "toward the first honest ending" offering a non-literal answer about how transformation requires both guides and travelers. Subtext operates through the disc's behavior, the child's impossible destinations, and the narrator's choice to remain. Theme emerges from particulars without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("melodically haunted ring that climbed the tunnel walls like damp ivy"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some passages edge toward elevated register ("cultivated estrangement the way gardeners cultivate orchids") but maintain coherence through the narrator's isolation-as-craft mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("ink-dark," "soft finality of a book snapped shut") though occasional density in descriptive passages. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetition of "loop" serves thematic purpose. Prose propels through varied syntax though a few passages could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass harmonica in an underground phone booth creates fresh specificity, while the wrong-number-as-connection and loop-as-teaching-tool transform familiar isolation narratives. The reveal that the child grew up and returned adds earned complexity. Risk in the lyrical register and conceptual ending mostly succeeds.</comment>
