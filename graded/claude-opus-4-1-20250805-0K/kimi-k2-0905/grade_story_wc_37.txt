<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keeper's journey from scattered amnesia to coherent identity drives meaningful change with embodied cost (mica shards driven into ribs sharpening recollection). Interior contradiction manifests through moths-in-skull imagery and the tension between forgetting self while remembering purpose. The final choice to let villagers keep her name while accepting scarred transformation shows earned renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the keeper's blood-mica fusion creates a new lens revealing infinite overlapping orchards, fundamentally reweighting the realm's problem from singular decay to isolated reflections. The cost is visceral (chest scarred, memories bled as silver dust) and the accumulative lens holds as density builds through alchemical imagery toward the final image of communities teaching songs. Minor orientation delay (keeper's identity/location clarifies gradually) serves the scattered-memory premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse functions as both setting and constraint—fruits that chime, trees growing from alembics in quicksilver dreams, obsidian panes blocking light all shape the keeper's tactics. The mica window's transformation from palm-sized pane to membrane to shattered lens that fuses with flesh shows environment actively constraining choice. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs but the mirror world's rules remain consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory recovery to realm salvation through the keeper's realization that "every mirror refused to reflect another's light," forcing her to alter the lullaby into communal invitation. The mica window's shattering represents irreversible commitment with immediate physical cost. Pressure coheres under accumulative logic as silence, tarry vines, and fragmented memory all converge at the greenhouse heart.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of isolation into chorus—the keeper's solo lullaby becoming communal canon that restores the realm. The final image of children learning songs that "kept mirrors bright" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting earlier scattered memories as necessary fragments of collective wholeness. The mica-flesh fusion embodies the theme of "bound release, pain become portal."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency through compound imagery ("alchemical orchard," "quicksilver dreams," "woven dawns") though occasionally strains toward purple prose. The keeper's perceptual signature—experiencing memories as moths, seeing through mica lenses—remains distinct. Some register elevation in peak moments ("bound release, pain become portal") pushes against naturalism but serves the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "fruits split to reveal clockwork seeds ticking backward" doing multiple jobs. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("tarry vines," "audible light," "spider-webbing surface" cluster without breathing room). The "scattered memory keeper" epithet repeats mechanically six times. Strong information density and momentum but mixed metaphors ("moths against glass" vs "pulled stitch") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mirror world premise where "reflections ripened into realities" offers fresh angle on parallel realm tropes. Specific inventions like woven dawns "braided by invisible hands" and the mica window that reveals infinite overlapping orchards show genuine imagination. The solution—transforming lullaby into communal canon—feels earned rather than convenient, though some elements (clockwork seeds, quicksilver dreams) lean toward ornamental.</comment>
