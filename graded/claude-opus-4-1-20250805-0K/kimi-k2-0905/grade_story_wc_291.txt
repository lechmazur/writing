<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The face-blind artist's unique perceptual constraint drives every choice, from painting "from the inside out" to using ribbon fibers in pigment. Internal contradiction emerges beautifully when she must "forgive her own mind's betrayal" while pursuing recognition. The final choice to leave evidence anonymously shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught motifs (ribbon fragment, masked identity, quarry as crime scene) that converge at closure when the mask discovery triggers town-wide memory. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as painted and tangible Elias unite, with cost visible in the bodies lifted into light. Slight orientation delay (who/where anchored late in paragraph 1) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry functions as active setting—its "furrowed hush," black water, and rusted police equipment constrain the artist's methods and charge the final discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects her face-blindness through focus on texture, sound, and scent over faces. The gardenia perfume release and water clearing when pigment drops show environment responding to action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: methodical research → ribbon fragment discovery → paint mixing with fibers → canvas fever → mask emergence → bodies revealed. The dominant stake (awakening town's amnesia) tightens when the painting literally pulls the mask from water. Cost appears in "bodies lifted into light" but could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the opposition of seen/unseen, remembered/forgotten without explicit moralizing. The artist's face-blindness becomes metaphor for collective amnesia, paid off when she must "forgive her own mind's betrayal." The final image of bodies in light while the artist's mind "already erasing the deputies' faces" resonantly reweights the opening condition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through the artist's non-facial focus ("tremor of a jaw muscle," "flare of a nostril"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to mystical transformation when paint warms and ribbon twitches. Some register elevation in peak moments ("lance the town's amnesia") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "boots grinding limestone into chalk that clung to the mist like guilt" show controlled density. However, template cadence appears ("She descended...She spread...She pinned...She did not flinch") and some metaphor density in early paragraphs ("lance the town's amnesia by unifying opposites") borders on overwrought. The prose achieves propulsion but occasional loops ("memory snapped into place—not her own, but the town's") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist concept freshly inverts expected detective work—solving through inability rather than ability. The paint-mixed-with-evidence creating backward recognition through time shows genuine ingenuity. The specific synthesis of prosopagnosia with forensic art creates an inevitable-feeling resolution.</comment>
