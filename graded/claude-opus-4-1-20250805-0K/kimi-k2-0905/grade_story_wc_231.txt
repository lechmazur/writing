<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's investigation through pattern recognition and her choice to release the Edelweiss demonstrate strong character-specific perception and meaningful agency. The contradiction between receiving/releasing the flower and the embodied cost of losing personal memories creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "borrowed memories" which occasionally drifts toward conceptual rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition driving escalation through gaps that accumulate meaning. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Maris releases the Edelweiss, paying with her own memories to break the cycle—visible cost on page. The "Repaid" entry and final image of the dock as "closed eye" effectively reweight prior material. Slight deduction for the middle section's temporal ambiguity around the log entry discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, mist, and dock create atmospheric pressure that shapes Maris's investigation methods—she must read absences rather than presences. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dock to tower to balcony and back. The "opal dock" and nautical twilight establish specific maritime atmosphere that constrains perception throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating gaps (missing gulls, ferry horn, reflection delay) that force Maris to recognize the cyclical trap. The choice to release the Edelweiss carries clear cost—sacrificing personal memories including her mother's song. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the middle investigation could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lighthouse keeper's role "between what is seen and what is erased" without explicit statement. The final shift from "investigating" to "attending" resonates as earned wisdom about witnessing versus controlling. The Edelweiss carrying "borrowed memories of alpine sun" creates specific thematic texture about memory as both gift and debt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in how Maris reads gaps and absences professionally. Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation ("First gap: no gulls cried") to lyrical perception ("tiny rafts that carried alpine sun"). Some filter verb accumulation in middle sections ("felt," "wondered," "understood") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density in lines like "boots clanging, the sound swallowed by mist so completely that each step felt erased." Several instances of elegant compression throughout. Deduction for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in investigation sequence and occasional abstract phrasing around "borrowed memories" concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cyclical time trap revealed through pattern observation offers a fresh angle on memory and debt. The specific detail of losing memories while breaking another's cycle creates non-obvious stakes. Transformation of lighthouse keeper role from guardian of navigation to witness of erasure shows thematic originality.</comment>
