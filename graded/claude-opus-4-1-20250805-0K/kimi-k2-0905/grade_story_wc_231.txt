I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through pattern recognition, symbolic accumulation, and cadence shifts rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris demonstrates clear interiority through embodied perception ("felt the stranger's final gesture humming in her bones") and makes concrete micro-choices (pinning the Edelweiss, releasing it to the sea). The contradiction between investigating gaps and becoming trapped by them creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "borrowed memories" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Maris breaks the cycle by releasing the Edelweiss, with visible cost (losing her own memories). The accumulative structure coheres well through gap-pattern recognition leading to the stranger's reappearance and ultimate resolution. Orientation anchors clearly established early (lighthouse, dock, nautical twilight).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-setting constrains choices brilliantly—the rotating beam literally creates the temporal loop. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist caught the light like milk stirred with silver"). The "opal dock" and persistent mist create atmospheric pressure that shapes Maris's investigation and final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating absences (gulls, ferry horn, reflection delay) that tighten around Maris. The cost is legible when she sacrifices personal memories to break the cycle. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the pre-written logbook entry, forcing recognition of temporal entrapment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between remembering and forgetting, with the lighthouse literally keeping what the sea forgets. The final image of the dock as "a closed eye that had finally dreamed the same dream as the light" offers resonant non-literal closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through maritime-specific observations ("tide slapped the pilings with a rhythm that left gaps"). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("nautical twilight finally surrendered") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("borrowed memories of alpine sun") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in the gap-listing sequence but purposeful for the pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of gaps-as-investigation-method is genuinely fresh, as is the temporal loop created through lighthouse rotation. The specific synthesis of alpine flower/maritime setting creates unexpected resonance. Risk-taking in the non-linear temporal structure heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
