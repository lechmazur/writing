<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction between wanting father to stop her and proceeding with betrayal creates genuine tension. The embodied detail of the mermaid fob "digging half-moons into my skin" and the "small wet click" of trust breaking avoid emotional abstraction. Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "locket heart" metaphor at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the narrator completes the trade despite hoping for intervention, with visible cost in the phonograph recording "Trust of the Moonshine Runner's Daughter." The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the decisive exchange at dawn. Slight dock for the abstract final line about "a silence no one could sell back."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market under the pier with "lanterns swung from rusted chains" and "crates of contraband" creates atmospheric pressure. The mermaid fob functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it must be held for the truce. Dock for some purple prose ("liquid night," "gold across crates") that doesn't always serve the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recording trust breaking while hoping father intervenes—creates sustained tension through the night vigil. The tightening occurs when dawn arrives without father, forcing the trade. Cost is legible in both the lost fob and the recorded sound of betrayal. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "trust breaking" concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of love's corrosion emerges through the concrete act of trading the family heirloom to record betrayal. The final image of feeling "lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The phonograph that "records feelings instead of songs" enriches the conceptual layer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "moonshine runner's daughter" and "liquid night," though occasionally veers into overwriting. The perceptual signature of noticing "gulls screamed news of my betrayal" fits the narrator's state. Deduction for register drift into elevated diction ("dilated like pupils") that strains against the bootlegger's daughter persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some strong imagery like "tide slapped the barnacled pilings" and concrete details of the market. However, multiple instances of purple prose ("liquid night," "gold across crates," "bruised lavender") and the overwrought "locket heart" metaphor reduce clarity. The abstract "silence no one could sell back" dulls the closure impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phonograph that records feelings instead of songs offers a fresh fantastical element grounded in the emotional stakes. The specific detail of the widow wearing a tear "like a diamond" after buying her husband's laugh elevates the concept. The bootlegger's daughter trading trust for proof transforms familiar betrayal themes.</comment>
