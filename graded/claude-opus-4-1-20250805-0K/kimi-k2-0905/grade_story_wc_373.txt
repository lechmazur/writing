<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to record "the sound of trust breaking" drives a complex internal conflict between loyalty and betrayal, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("I wanted him to stop me, to care enough to stop me"). The final choice to surrender the fob is earned through accumulated cost, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("love can corrode").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fob drops and trust audibly breaks ("a small wet click, like a photograph of my father slipping from my locket heart"), with visible cost in the narrator feeling "lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the breaking point, though the orientation slightly delays (pier location clear, but temporal anchoring soft until "Hours dilated").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate market's sensory detail ("Lanterns swung from rusted chains, throwing gold across crates") creates atmosphere while the fob's physical presence ("her tail digging half-moons into my skin") constrains choice. Setting subtly pressures through rising tide and market sounds, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("jars that looked like fallen stars").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing trust breaking by surrendering the family heirloom—tightens as hours pass without father's arrival, forcing the narrator to confront that his absence itself breaks trust. Cost is legible in the final trade, though escalation relies more on internal accumulation than external pressure shifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of trading the fob to record an abstract breaking, with the phonograph that "recorded feelings instead of songs" literalizing emotional documentation. The ending reweights love as burden ("a weight I had mistaken for love") without moralizing, though occasional abstraction surfaces ("trust begins to fracture").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with distinctive perceptual signature ("move like liquid night," "pirates bargained in whispers, as if the air itself were guilty"). Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure, though occasional elevated diction strains POV plausibility ("corrode," "dilated like pupils").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful compression, but figurative density occasionally obscures ("bruised lavender," "speared through cracks"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("truce of hush" concept restated), and filter constructions accumulate ("I realized," "I knew," "I felt").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The phonograph that records feelings transforms a familiar betrayal narrative through specific invention, and the "truce of hush" concept freshly frames silence as currency. Some elements feel template-adjacent (moonshine runner backdrop), but the emotional specificity of wanting to be stopped elevates execution.</comment>
