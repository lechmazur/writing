<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arden's motivation to anchor the ferry and save the phantom passengers drives concrete choices through the hourglass mechanics. His "resiliently positive" trait manifests in refusing to accept vanishing and laughing at the grotto's closing, though the emotional complexity could deepen. The final choice to merge timelines carries visible cost as the hourglass crumbles to dust.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with phosphorescent barnacles spelling coordinates, radio voices layering heartbeats, and the hourglass filling with constellations building toward Resonant Reconfiguration. The ferry solidifying as Arden steers "via interconnected patterns" creates clear escalation. Closure lands with felt cost as the hourglass disintegrates and Arden accepts his "permanent transient life," though the exact nature of what he sacrifices could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto with phosphorescent barnacles that "spell out coordinates in a language that tasted like salt and regret" constrains Arden's navigation choices. The ferry's flickering between solid and translucent states creates spatial pressure. Setting actively shapes the resolution as the grotto closes "like fingers after prayer," forcing Arden's timeline decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the Accumulative lens as each navigation maneuver solidifies more ferry (safety poster regains ink, coffee machine gurgles back). The grotto closing while "starlight thinned to a wire" creates time pressure forcing Arden's choice. Cost is visible as the hourglass burns through his coat and crumbles, though the personal stakes beyond saving passengers could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of choosing between parallel possibilities emerges through the hourglass mechanics and Arden's acceptance of perpetual transition. His mother's laughter "died in a different decade" adds emotional weight to the timeline choice. The final image of Arden ready to "tie the next line whenever the world decided to slip again" resonates, though deeper exploration of what makes one timeline worth preserving over another would strengthen thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with inventive imagery ("the moon dripped like melting silver," "auroral thread"). POV remains stable with Arden's perspective filtering the surreal events through maritime vocabulary. The prose modulates effectively from lyrical description to urgent action during the grotto sequence, maintaining clarity through the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong figurative language that serves the fantastical premise without overwhelming ("stalactites knitting together like fingers after prayer"). Some repetition of "resiliently positive" feels slightly forced. Information density is high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere, though occasional abstraction ("weight of saved possibilities") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry concept with timeline-merging mechanics offers fresh territory in speculative fiction. Specific maritime details ground the fantastical elements. The phosphorescent barnacles spelling coordinates and the empty hourglass that fills with constellations show imaginative world-building that serves the story's logic rather than ornament.</comment>
