I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Arden merges the timelines.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arden's motivation to anchor the ferry and save the phantom passengers drives credible choices throughout, with his "resiliently positive" trait manifesting in concrete actions like the twice-flipped hourglass and radio broadcast. The final choice to merge timelines shows genuine cost—accepting a "permanent transient life"—though some interiority relies on abstraction rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as Arden accepts permanent transience to save both timelines, with the hourglass crumbling to "glass dust that hung suspended." The accumulative structure coheres through phosphorescent barnacles, radio echoes, and timeline flickering, though the exact mechanics of the merge remain somewhat opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto with phosphorescent barnacles spelling coordinates creates a vivid, constraining environment that directly shapes Arden's choices. The ferry's flickering between solid and translucent states provides strong spatial grounding, and micro-details like "coffee machine gurgled back to life, dripping phantom espresso" anchor the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the grotto closing ("stalactites knitting together like fingers after prayer") and the hourglass burning through Arden's coat, forcing the urgent choice between timelines. The cost materializes in accepting a "permanent transient life," though the middle section could tighten the pressure more viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of choosing between parallel possibilities emerges through concrete images—the empty hourglass that "carried the weight of saved possibilities" and Arden's sideways smile "knowing that every rotation of the earth was now another ferry ride between what was and what still could be." The final reweighting avoids explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical compression with distinctive phrasings like "the moon dripped like melting silver" and "coordinates in a language that tasted like salt and regret." The perceptual signature stays character-specific through Arden's maritime focus, though occasional elevated diction ("auroral thread") slightly strains the deckhand's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery, but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching ("wake spread in slow motion spirals," "stalactites knitting together like fingers"). Some mixed metaphors ("radio whispered thanks") and occasional register drift reduce clarity in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a ferry caught between timelines offers fresh treatment of parallel universe tropes through specific maritime details and the empty hourglass mechanic. The "permanent transient" resolution synthesizes the paradox meaningfully, though some elements feel derivative of time-slip fiction.</comment>
