<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's transformation from cataloguer to something more primal is earned through concrete details like "paw—no, her hand" and the interiorization process. Her befriending of uncertainty carries genuine cost as she dissolves into the garden itself. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "dimensional homesickness" that occasionally drifts from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the guardian's gradual dissolution into the garden serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes the frozen rose, sundial, and mist with clear cost (loss of discrete self). The interiorization process builds through concrete stages: breath to commas, statues to memories, finally self to garden. Slight deduction for the cultist backstory arriving late without earlier grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden functions as both setting and metaphor for the guardian's state—ice preserving "what could never again open yet refusing to let it close." Sensory details like "mist tasting of iron and old parchment" and the sundial "casting no shadow because moonlight had forgotten how to be sharp" constrain her choices and charge the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—befriending uncertainty through dissolution—deepens progressively as the guardian moves from waiting for answers to "waiting within the questions themselves," culminating in her acceptance of becoming the garden. The pendant's transformation from external gift to internalized heartbeat marks clear escalation. Cost is visible but could be more viscerally felt in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interiorization motif—boundaries becoming "permeable membranes," the library revealed as thresholds rather than books. The final image of the guardian becoming the frozen rose perfectly embodies the paradox of preservation through transformation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression—"breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas" establishes the metaphorical register immediately. The prose maintains this heightened diction consistently, modulating with the guardian's dissolution. Minor moments of register elevation ("dimensionally homesick") occasionally strain the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "interiorizing exteriors" that builds meaning. Some passages risk overwriting—"boundaries of light were not edges but invitations to trespass"—but generally maintain clarity. The paraphrase loop around waiting/attendance in paragraphs 9 and 23 creates minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a library guardian who guards boundaries rather than books, dissolving into what she protects, offers fresh perspective on familiar elements. The interiorization process as magical mechanism feels specific to this world. Transformation of the cultist from antagonist to fellow exile adds unexpected depth.</comment>
