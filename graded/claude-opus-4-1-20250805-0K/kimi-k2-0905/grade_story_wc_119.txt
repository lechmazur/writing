<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Chen's internal conflict between spy/sage identities drives meaningful choices, particularly his decision to orchestrate his own disappearance. The "accidentally prophetic" fortune writing creates genuine tension between intention and effect. His final renunciation of both roles for something unnamed carries visible cost ("felt the rocky island slide inside him").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Chen's departure, with the keeper discovering the prophetic fortune coming true ("THE ROCK YOU STAND ON WILL SOON STAND INSIDE YOU"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery builds (lighthouse beam, microdot specs, fortune cookies) toward Chen's transformation. Cost is felt through Chen absorbing the island's essence and the keeper's too-late realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively—the rotating beam provides exposure for the microdot film, the isolation enables the spy work, and the granite spine becomes a "lithophone" that Chen ultimately internalizes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("white explosions that looked like negatives developing"). The island's transformation from external to internal landscape charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Chen's realization that staying would make him "one more note in its familiar enigma," forcing his departure choice. The fortune's accidental prophecy creates pressure as "it was accidentally prophetic, the kind that turned true because people carried it in their pockets." Cost manifests as Chen feels "the rocky island slide inside him," permanently altered by his choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox of "open secrets"—truths hidden in plain sight, from Chen's fortune cookies to the lighthouse's confessions. The fortune "THE ROCK YOU STAND ON WILL SOON STAND INSIDE YOU" operates both literally and metaphorically, reweighting as Chen internalizes the island. The ending offers resonant ambiguity without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with distinctive phrasings ("transpose life into a new key," "familiar enigma"). POV distance is well-calibrated, accessing Chen's interiority while maintaining mystery. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, particularly the keeper's casual ignorance contrasting with Chen's deeper knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, though occasional overwriting appears ("lithophone—stone keys that chimed when tide struck them"). Some metaphor density in non-peak moments (-0.3). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. The final image of "the key of salt and departure" resonates without forcing closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of spy thriller and fortune cookie wisdom creates an unexpected combination that feels organic. The concept of fortunes as "open secrets" that become true through belief offers fresh insight. The lighthouse as both "pen and darkroom" shows inventive use of setting, though the premise doesn't fully transform genre expectations.</comment>
