I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen's internal contradiction between spy and sage drives authentic choices, particularly his decision to "orchestrate his own disappearance." The keeper remains functional but underdeveloped. Chen's final renunciation ("microdot specs traded for reading glasses") forecloses his spy path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Chen's departure as Earned Stasis - he renounces his spy life with visible cost ("the rocky island slide inside him"). The closure lands but the cost could be more visceral. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-darkroom conceit constrains Chen's choices effectively ("the lighthouse lamp would provide the exposure he required"). The island as "lithophone—stone keys that chimed when tide struck them" charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (Chen's desire to escape his dual life) deepens through the fortune "THE ROCK YOU STAND ON WILL SOON STAND INSIDE YOU" which becomes "accidentally prophetic." The escalation is modest but coherent under the textural lens, with Chen's departure foreclosing his spy path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "open secret" motif resonates throughout, from fortune cookies to the lighthouse beam "signaling nothing and everything." The ending reweights earlier material as Chen follows his own cryptic advice, though some philosophical passages ("the sea keeps its secrets by speaking them aloud") edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with distinctive phrasings like "familiar enigma" and "transpose life into a new key." Some filter-heavy passages ("Chen felt the sentence tug like undertow") and occasional overwriting ("white explosions that looked like negatives developing") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("moonlit combers smash the granite spine—white explosions"). Some template cadence appears ("Chen stepped... Chen descended... Chen recalled"). The paraphrase loop around "open secret" creates minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-darkroom/pen fusion offers a fresh angle on the spy genre. The fortune cookie writer who becomes his own prophecy shows originality. However, the mysterious-lighthouse-keeper setup follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
