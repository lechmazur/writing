<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exorcist's internal contradiction between professional detachment ("gossip-column") and personal guilt drives meaningful choices, particularly in the climactic "I was wrong" admission. The sister-ghost's question "Was any of it heard?" reveals layered characterization beyond simple haunting. Minor deduction for the ghost's relatively thin presence until the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through musical notation imagery culminating in the "rest followed by tie" revelation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the sister's forgiveness and the exorcist's release, with visible cost in the felled orchard and "echo" she keeps. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting constrains choices through the specific folder location and induced currents that guide discovery. Sensory details like "air tasted of iron filings and unplayed sonatas" create atmospheric pressure. The orchard's destruction provides temporal urgency though its causal connection to the reconciliation could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional reputation through personal guilt to the irrevocable loss of reconciliation opportunity as tractors idle. The perfume's single drop creates scarcity pressure, and the sister's appearance crystallizes the choice between maintaining the exorcism or accepting error. Cost is visible in both the kept "echo" and the felled orchard.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the musical rest metaphor—silence as presence rather than absence—without explicit moralizing. The "imperfect miracle" concept reweights from flaw to necessity, and "Play the rest; that's where I live" offers profound subtext about grief's persistence. The final lilac blooming from "forgiven silence" resonates without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends tabloid vernacular ("CELEBRITY MEDIUM BANS BANSHEE") with lyrical precision ("dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios"). The metaphor-heavy narration fits the exorcist who "advises through metaphors," though occasional density risks opacity. Clean POV control throughout with purposeful compression serving the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "edges flickering like a piano chord struck too hard," though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("swirling notation: a rest followed by a tie, a breath that refuses to end"). Some template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story. Information density high but risks overwriting in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of tabloid exorcism with musical theory creates genuine freshness—"gossip-column exorcist" is memorably specific. The concept that ghosts live in musical rests rather than notes transforms familiar haunting tropes. Risk-taking in the metaphor-dense approach heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
