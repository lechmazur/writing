<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The negotiator carries genuine weight through accumulated loss and responsibility, with her internal conflict between hope and exhaustion embodied in concrete details like the scarred clipboard and the list of the dead. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("beauty flawed by responsibility") rather than embodied perception, and the collective delegates lack individual distinction despite their presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story reaches for Accumulative/Textural closure through the ritual accumulation of names and shared grief, but the ending trails off mid-sentence without completing its closure unit. The piece establishes clear who/where/when anchors early and maintains coherent causality through the ceremony, yet the incomplete ending prevents any definitive change, reconfiguration, or repricing from landing on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient terrace setting provides consistent spatial grounding and the celestial dance creates atmospheric pressure, with the scarred clipboard serving as a micro-setting that accumulates meaning. Yet the setting remains largely static backdrop rather than actively constraining choices—the terrace could be any ceremonial space without altering the core dynamics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of ending the forever war builds through the ritual accumulation of names and shared responsibility, creating modest escalation through collective participation. However, the negotiator's agency remains primarily observational—she signs but doesn't drive the transformation, and the actual treaty terms and their costs remain abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of failed attempts and the acceptance of imperfect peace, with the scarred clipboard embodying the weight of history. The ending gestures toward "redemption's price" as accepting flawed solutions, though the abstract phrasing ("forever peace would require constant tending") and incomplete closure prevent full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness, relying on abstract elevated diction ("ritual significance," "flawed beauty") that creates distance rather than immediacy. The POV control is stable but the perceptual signature remains generic—any negotiator could narrate these observations without character-specific filtering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive abstract phrasing ("manifest in the precise positioning," "beauty flawed by responsibility") creates opacity throughout, with multiple paraphrase loops restating the same concepts. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and the incomplete final sentence literally cuts off mid-thought, severely undermining line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of accumulated failure transforming into fragile hope offers a non-obvious angle on peace negotiations, particularly the image of reading names of the dead as witness. However, execution relies on familiar abstractions about war and peace without sufficient particular detail to distinguish this specific conflict or world.</comment>
