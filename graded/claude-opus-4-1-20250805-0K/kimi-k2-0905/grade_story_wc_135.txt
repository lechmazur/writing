Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and recurring motifs (the trumpet, staggered intervals, fragments/wholeness) toward a resonant final moment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to compile fragments despite exile is clear and deepens through concrete choices (seeking the trumpet parts, negotiating with the woman). The internal conflict between institutional duty and personal reckoning plays out through embodied actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("reactively visionary") that lacks immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through the trumpet's assembly toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the final note "folded into every doorway like a page finally turned." The cost is visible - trading the promise to archive absence for the mouthpiece. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's transformation from "blank page" to "fresh margin" constrains and enables choices throughout. Specific details like "customs kiosk," "conservatory's back gate," and "cliff cemetery" create a navigable geography. The trumpet valve's physical properties ("brass was pitted") charge the final assembly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the trumpet's assembly stages, each requiring negotiation and revealing cost. The pressure accumulates from personal exile to collective healing need. The final choice to blow the note carries visible weight through "staggered intervals of fear and forgiveness."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fragment/wholeness motif and the transformation of absence into presence. The concept of archiving what's missing gains complexity through action. The ending's "page finally turned" reweights the opening's "page left blank" without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("every cobblestone a word washed away"). The perceptual signature filters everything through archival metaphors. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I kept the mouthpiece to remember how exile tastes").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("salt crust on my coat and the title ocean-spray archivist") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("reactively visionary") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The "ocean-spray archivist" concept and the inversion of archiving absence rather than presence offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of exile, music, and documentary practice creates something memorably particular. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode pays off.</comment>
