I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, with the closure arriving through density shift and resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to rebuild faith through physical reconstruction is embodied in concrete actions (kneeling, cleaning bones, teaching hymns). Her internal conflict between exile and return manifests through specific choices like sleeping in the tomb and teaching the caretaker. The final choice to remain and guide other "interrupted journeys" carries visible cost—forsaking further travel for rootedness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the prayer house reconstructs itself and the protagonist chooses permanent residence, with cost visible in "never left the island again." The accumulative structure coheres as bone-threading roots, mirror reflections, and shadow-casting build toward the transformative dawn scene. Who/where/when anchors establish by line 2-3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as active setting—roots thread through bones, create "living arches," and guide the path to reconstruction. The sundial's shadow interaction with charred beams that "remember their former shape" makes environment essential to the closure mechanism. Sensory work is selective and POV-filtered ("myrrh-scented air," "bones rattling approval").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal return to communal restoration, with the tightening occurring when roots begin moving and pointing toward the prayer house site. The protagonist's agency drives the reconstruction through deliberate sundial placement and hymn-teaching. Cost registers in the permanent foreclosure of travel—"never left the island again."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of interrupted journeys that can "resume if given a shadow to follow" emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement. The final image of the protagonist touching the cemented sundial while feeling "time, like faith, could be rebuilt" offers a non-literal answer to whether return can restore what was destroyed. The mirrors showing twelve generational faces deepens the personal quest into ancestral pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with selective perception ("fossilized petals," "oxidized copper eyes"). The caretaker's single line of dialogue carries appropriate wariness and youth. Some mild register elevation in "cautious enchantment thick as honey" but it serves the accumulative texture rather than disrupting voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures that support the accumulative build. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("roots threading warmly curious fingers through the bones of ancestors"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("gravity tugging her back toward a faith") and slight overwriting in the mirror sequence, though neither touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, archaeological excavation, and faith reconstruction through physical shadow-casting offers a non-obvious angle. The specific mechanism of sundial shadow reanimating burned structures is fresh. The story commits to its premise of material reconstruction as spiritual restoration without retreat into abstraction.</comment>
