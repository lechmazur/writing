<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven carving reveals concrete motivation through embodied action, with her "thumb calloused from years of gripping safety ropes" and the physical act of transforming wood into memory. The contradiction between preserving and releasing Emil drives genuine tension. However, the ghostly promise "he would stay if she just kept the cage door closed" strains credibility as literal dialogue from a funeral, and some emotional transitions feel too neat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's acceptance of "here and gone" - she transforms from trying to contain memory to understanding memory as "both cage and key." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward this reweighting. Minor orientation wobble with "Through crystallized time she saw Emil's gloved hand slip into hers after the funeral" creates temporal confusion but doesn't break closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The loft setting actively shapes Mara's choices - the skylight's rain-beaded glass becomes both workspace illumination and reflective surface for memory. Physical details like "rust-hued sawdust" and the cage latch hung "beside the skylight" constrain and enable her grief work. The jars labeled with marriage seasons create lived-in specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered craft details toward Mara's acceptance that "memory can be both cage and key." The cost is visible in the jar collection of marriage "distilled to sawdust" and her planned second carving with "eyes open." However, the escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than decisive turns, appropriate for the lens but limiting dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the carving process - the lion that "obeyed, but death had better hearing" offers resonant insight without moralizing. The "here and gone" concept reweights from loss to acceptance through concrete action. The jar labels and final image of Mara's face reflected with "the empty ring below" create non-literal answers to grief's central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric control with distinctive perceptual signature - "smelled of sawdust and thunder" and "rust-hued peace" create character-specific observation. Some register elevation in "crystallized into a single held breath" fits the heightened emotional state. The temporal slip at the funeral and occasional overwriting ("prismed across their skin") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs - "swept the shavings into a jar labeled 'Manes & Mettle'" advances action while revealing character. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms: "sawdust and thunder, hauntingly practical" and multiple "rust-hued peace" iterations create ornamental weight. Template cadence appears in "She would... She traced... She lifted" opening sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The widow-as-craftsperson transforming grief into carved memory offers fresh specificity beyond typical bereavement narratives. The circus setting with its particular dangers and the jar collection system create memorable particulars. The insight that taming predators parallels processing grief ("move slow, speak softer, never blink first") synthesizes elements originally.</comment>
