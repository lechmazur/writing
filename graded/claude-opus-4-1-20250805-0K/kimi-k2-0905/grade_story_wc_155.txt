<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's motivation to recover lost joy is embodied through concrete actions (searching for color, painting with light, pressing palms to wall), with internal contradiction between present sorrow and childhood memory driving the peak choice. The transformation from "pocket empty yet heart over-exposed" shows earned change with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Luma realizes "joy had never been lost; it had merely waited to be developed" - this reweights the entire search with felt cost ("each brushstroke cost her a sigh of present sorrow"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory layers build toward the final image of the laughing child refilling the orchard. Minor orientation delay (who/where clarifies late in paragraph 1) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district functions as active setting - the cider house wall "remembered every hand that touched it" constrains where the mural can be displayed, while the fresco fragment from the apple press enables the entire transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (fog that "folded," walls smelling of "fermented stars"), with environment directly shaping the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from searching for a misplaced color to risking "present sorrow" to develop the memory-film, with clear cost at each stage. The Lantern Lattice complicates by requiring a specific living wall, narrowing options. The trade-off is explicit: exchanging current pain for recovered joy, though the middle section could tighten pressure between discovery and painting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the photography/development metaphor - joy requires exposure, risk, and courage to be "developed." The final image of the child "refilling the ruined orchard with color one sun-drop at a time" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The fresco fragment that dissolves into the wall creates a perfect synthesis of broken pieces healing into "one flowering tree."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric compression ("fog that drowned," "palette in hand") and consistent POV control. Some register elevation strains in places ("conspiratorial wink," "pensive mirth") but the perceptual signature remains specific to an artist who sees in light and color. The experimental/lyric mode is taught early and sustained, though occasional abstract phrasing ("spectral dust") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("fog kept its ancient silence," "masonry like a graft that heals two broken branches") with good rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears ("fermented stars," "centuries of orchard light arrested mid-kiss") and the phrase "pensive mirth" feels forced. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, though abstract moments like "joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust" reduce precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of painting, photography, and memory development creates a fresh angle on recovering lost joy. The Lantern Lattice network of dead painters' knowledge and the specific mechanism of projecting film onto a living wall show genuine ingenuity. The image of joy as undeveloped film waiting for courage to expose it transforms familiar material through specific artistic metaphor.</comment>
