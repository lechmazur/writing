<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon's motivation through the shadow work of grief is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment in her gravitational lightness and the physical act of stitching photographs. The transformation from isolation to becoming "a quiet lantern" carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "shadow work" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught gravity/emotion linkage paying off when joy counterbalances "ten billion deaths." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Halcyon choosing to stay and tend "this archive of redeemed shadows," transforming the ship from "coffin" to "seed." Cost is visible in her permanent separation from the original dimension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables—its patched hull "stitched from ribs of dead cruisers" mirrors the photograph sail, and the gravity spinner enables the dimensional crossing. The locked dimension as destination provides essential pressure. Every setting detail serves the central metaphor of transformation through salvage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of opening the locked dimension escalates through the photograph-stitching sequence to the threshold moment where "faces pressing through" test her resolve. The gravity/joy mechanism creates a specific cost equation. Agency is clear in her choice to stay, though the middle could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of salvaged materials—ship, photographs, tears—into instruments of mercy. The final image of the ship as "a gentle gravity calling stray souls home" offers a non-literal answer about choosing creation over destruction. "Mercy is the mirror I choose" crystallizes without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and effective compression ("star-pocked silence," "gravitationally lighter when happy"). Perceptual signature strong in how she experiences the photographs as "ghosts she refused to abandon." Some elevated diction ("bruise in space") serves the mythic register well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"hull stitched together from the ribs of a dozen dead cruisers, every weld a scar." Strong propulsion through varied syntax. Minor repetition in "photograph" usage but serves accumulative pattern. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gravity-emotion linkage is genuinely fresh, as is the concept of stitching photographs into a dimensional sail. The transformation of recycled war materials into instruments of peace through physical labor offers specificity. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and mythic register heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
