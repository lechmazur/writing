I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—her gravitational lightness manifesting joy, the physical act of stitching photographs into a sail. The contradiction between her pacifist nature and the need for "joy heavy enough to counterbalance ten billion deaths" creates genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around shadow work that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Sister Halcyon transforms from keeper to gardener, with visible cost (choosing to stay in the locked dimension). The accumulative structure coheres as each image-layer (photographs, tear, sail) builds toward the final transformation of the ship into a "seed rather than a coffin." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship functions as both setting and metaphor, its "stitched hull" constraining and enabling the journey. The gravity spinner that responds to emotion directly shapes the ship's movement. The locked dimension as final setting charges the closure with its "vast auditorium of light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through textural deepening—from personal grief to species-level shadow work to the final choice to stay. The pressure intensifies when "faces pressing through from the other side" test her resolve. Cost is visible in her permanent separation from the known world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of recycled/dead materials into living garden. The final image of humanity choosing "to become a quiet lantern rather than a final bomb" resonates without moralizing. Kwan Yin's Tear dissolving into upward rain perfectly embodies mercy-as-transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with distinctive perceptual signature ("star-pocked silence," "gravitationally lighter"). The prose modulates effectively between quieter reflection and the intensity of breaching dimensions. Slight register elevation in places ("vast auditorium of light") fits the mythic scope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm support the accumulative structure. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and symbolic registers. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("archive of redeemed shadows") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of Buddhist mythology, sci-fi setting, and psychological shadow work creates genuine originality. The specific image of stitching photographs into a sail using hair as thread feels both inevitable and surprising. Risk-taking in the lyrical-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
