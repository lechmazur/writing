<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between "quietly enthusiastic" hope and "stellar doubt" creates genuine contradictory impulses, particularly when she realizes sacrifice means surrendering identity. The choice to swallow the spiral carries visible physical cost ("cutting yet sealing"), though some interiority relies on abstract phrases like "wavelength align with purpose" rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira transforms into waveform, becoming the antenna/lighthouse with clear cost (loss of physical form). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static bursts intensify into visible sine waves, then lullaby, building density toward transformation. However, the orientation arrives late (~150 words) and some causal links feel conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck constrains choice effectively—its golden panes brighten in response to the coin arrangement, creating the sine waves Lira must surf. The coins' physical properties (Martian copper with melted edge, warming/cooling) and the spiral pattern on the deck directly enable the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from decoding prophecies to sacrificing human form, with the coins "jealous of transcendence" creating resistance. The cost is legible when metal slides down her throat "like frozen starlight, cutting yet sealing," though the middle section could tighten the pressure between understanding and sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy concept elegantly reweights at closure—Lira becomes a backwards prophecy herself, "still speaking itself into the dark." The lighthouse/lullaby duality and the coins orbiting her waveform create resonant non-literal answers about purpose persisting through cycles of collapse and birth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through synesthetic details ("starlight fossilized into golden panes," "static bursts drifted like dying breaths"). Some passages drift into elevated register ("terrible clarity," "transcendence") that feels slightly detached from Lira's embodied experience, though the voice maintains coherent texture through the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied syntax, but several abstract phrases weaken immediacy: "wavelength align with purpose" appears four times with minimal variation, "stellar doubt" three times. The transformation sequence achieves propulsion through concrete action ("swallowed the spiral whole"), though some figurative language feels strained ("jealous of transcendence").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of entropy, prophecy, and cosmic lighthouse creates a non-obvious angle on post-apocalyptic transcendence. The reversal of prophecies that only make sense backwards after events, combined with Lira becoming a prophecy herself, shows genuine conceptual ingenuity beyond template last-survivor narratives.</comment>
