<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysira's motivation to preserve forbidden memory through embodied art is clear and compelling, with internal contradiction between exile's emptiness and her body's persistent rhythm. The transformation from dancer to living verse shows earned change through specific physical cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional states ("absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lysira transforms into "forbidden memory" itself, with visible cost in the moonstone dust's sacrifice and physical inscription. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the dance sequence. Slight weakness in the opening's orientation speed and some abstract connective tissue between memory ban and tide dancing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden and moonstone dust effectively constrain choices—she must complete the verse before sunrise, and the dust's finite quantity demands sacrifice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("obsidian grace, smooth and cutting"). The setting actively participates in the transformation but occasionally drifts toward abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate as Lysira races against dawn while the moonstone dust dims, forcing the final sacrifice. The cost is visible in the dust burning to complete the verse. However, the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond time pressure, and the transformation process could show more struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concept of memory as bodily inscription that outlasts censorship. The final image of footprints spiraling into absence while stars form a dancer's shape offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates through dance as language and the body as archive of forbidden knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("fledge," "spontaneously anchored"). The perceptual signature is consistent—everything filtered through a dancer's embodied awareness. Strong syntactic variety and metaphorical coherence throughout, with deliberate pattern-teaching of poetic diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the verse-inscription sequence. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth") but remains coherent. Prose propulsion accelerates effectively during the dance sequence with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of body-as-text that circumvents censorship through embodied memory is fresh and specific. The transformation of dance into living constellation offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and metaphorical density heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
