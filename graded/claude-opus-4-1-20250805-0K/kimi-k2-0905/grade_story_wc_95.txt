<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradictions through Vela's mechanical precision versus philosophical fluidity, with the needle card serving as both cipher and emotional anchor. The final handclasp between brass and flesh after Caelus removes his vocoder earns the transformation with visible vulnerability. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophical dialogue that could be more grounded in physical struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decisive Change lands cleanly when the glass atrium dissolves and both duelists step into the brook together, transforming philosophical combat into shared journey. Causal linkage holds through the duel's question-parry structure leading to Caelus's vocoder removal. Cost is visible in his exposed scar and raw voice. Slight opacity in the sundial's coded angles weakens mid-story causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass atrium's reflective walls amplify the philosophical duel, while the brook's water becomes the physical threshold they cross at closure. The sundial's shadow tracks time and encodes meaning through specific angles. Minor deduction for the atrium's dissolution being more metaphorical than physically grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic tenure/exile through philosophical sparring to Caelus's physical vulnerability when removing his vocoder. The needle card's punctures accumulate as both cipher and emotional record. Final cost visible in the scar and raw voice, though mid-duel escalation relies heavily on abstract philosophical moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of questions as destinations, crystallizing when they literally step into the brook to "arrive before departing." The transformation from combat to collaboration reweights all prior dueling imagery. Subtext operates through the needle card's hidden code and Caelus's concealed injury.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice through academic-mechanical fusion ("the higher whir of gears," "diplomatically fierce negotiations"). Clean POV control throughout with selective perception of shadows and angles. Dialogue maintains philosophical register while carrying combat subtext. Some repetitive "question" constructions in mid-section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong opening with the atrium's dual hums and closing with copper-thread binding. Information density high in descriptive passages. Template cadence appears in philosophical exchange ("She said," "He spoke," pattern) and some synonym churn around "question/paradox/query." Line-level control stronger in physical description than abstract dialogue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosophical debate as physical duel with prosthetic enhancements adding stakes to intellectual combat. The needle card as mother's revolutionary gift turned philosophical cipher shows specific invention. Risk-taking in the genre blend pays off, though some philosophical abstractions trend toward familiar academic territory.</comment>
