<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's character shows strong motivation through concrete actions (tasting glass, stealing seed, pruning with purpose), and her choices drive the narrative causally toward transformation. The embodied details ("knees grinding into rust flakes") and micro-choices under pressure are vivid, though some interior moments lean toward abstraction ("informally wise") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the greenhouse transforms and citizens' memories are rewired, with visible cost in Marisol's blood sacrifice and the risk of Ministry persecution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through sensory density and pattern-building toward the final transformation, though the rapid resolution in the final paragraphs slightly compresses the cost demonstration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse functions as both setting and metaphor, constraining choices (the celestial alignment window) and charging the final transformation from decay to "copper bones polished by vine tendrils." Sensory detail is rich and purposeful ("rust flakes that tasted of old rain"), with the setting actively shaping Marisol's tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal rebellion to collective transformation, with the celestial alignment creating genuine time pressure that forces action. The cost manifests in Marisol's blood offering and the risk of Ministry retribution, though the ease of the final transformation (officers leaving "disarmed" with seeds) slightly deflates the established tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of pruning decay into beauty, with the final image of officers carrying seeds offering a non-literal answer about how change propagates. The story resists simple moralizing, letting the transformation of rust to copper and memory rewiring speak to renewal without stating its thesis explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive metaphors ("light poured through the broken roof in a molten lattice") and consistent POV control. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though occasional elevated diction ("synaptic plasticity," "meristems") creates minor register drift from Marisol's otherwise grounded perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose shows strong momentum and density with lines doing multiple jobs, but suffers from occasional overwriting in figurative language ("volatile molecules that drifted through the rusted bars") and some template cadence in the middle section. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend the piece, though some metaphors strain clarity ("silver needle" for planetary alignment).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of memory-altering fruit grown in ruins offers fresh synthesis, with specific details like tasting memories through blood and the Ministry of Palate avoiding generic dystopia. The transformation feels earned through established pattern, though the seed's convenient properties and the ease of final victory reduce risk-taking impact.</comment>
