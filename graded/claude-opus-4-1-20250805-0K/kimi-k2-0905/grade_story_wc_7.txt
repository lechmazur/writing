I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** given its lyric density, pattern-based progression, and resonant reconfiguration closure through collective transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is crystal clear—stealing forbidden memory to rewire collective consciousness through taste. Her internal conflict between careful rebellion and urgent action manifests through embodied details like "knees grinding into rust flakes." The transformation from individual act to collective awakening is earned through concrete choices with visible cost (her blood feeding the plant).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Ministry officers leaving "disarmed, pockets mysteriously full of plum-colored seeds" shows transformation spreading beyond Marisol's initial act. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers toward this crystallized image where cost is felt in "every scar carries the latitude of future sweetness." Who/where/when anchored early through "rusted greenhouse" and "twin moons rose."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both setting and metaphor, constraining choices through its "corroded ribs" and "cracked panes" while enabling transformation. Sensory detail is exceptional—"tasting the memory of every gardener who had ever bled here"—with the environment actively shaping tactics. The final transformation where "rust flaked away to reveal copper bones" charges the closure with earned beauty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes established immediately through the Ministry's prohibition against "unauthorized nostalgia." Pressure intensifies through the celestial timing constraint ("seven breaths away") and escalates as Marisol's rebellion spreads to others. The cost is legible when guards weep and bureaucrats laugh, showing irrevocable change to the social order.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of pruning—"beauty was not the opposite of decay but its most cunning offshoot." The story resists simple rebellion-versus-authority binaries, exploring how memory and taste can restructure consciousness. The final image of seeds in officers' pockets offers a non-literal answer about how change propagates through unexpected vessels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with distinctive perceptual signature—Marisol reads the world through taste and botanical knowledge. Prose rhythm accelerates during the planting sequence. Some register elevation ("volatile molecules," "meristems") fits her expertise though occasionally strains naturalism in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"vines rose fast as clock hands spinning backward" compresses time, motion, and thematic reversal. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("green applause," "stained-glass forgiveness") though patterns cohere. Sentence variety strong; no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-flavor with botanical rebellion feels genuinely fresh—"synaptic plasticity" as literal garden cultivation. The specific detail of tasting memories through blood on glass transforms a potentially abstract concept into visceral experience. Risk-taking in the dense lyric mode heightens rather than obscures the stakes.</comment>
