<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and compelling—the borrowed heart creates a visceral need to understand his donor's life. His internal experience is richly embodied through physical sensations ("new rhythm in his chest," "borrowed heart accelerate") and concrete actions. The final choice to return as a story-keeper shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery and discovery. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael understands why people magnetize stories and accepts his role, with felt cost in absorbing the donor's memories. However, the story cuts off mid-sentence, preventing full closure assessment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the floating tea house, rope ladders, and sun trails all shape Kael's journey and choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted of iron and bergamot"). The morpho wing's iridescent properties literally guide navigation, making environment inseparable from plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the donor's magnetism) drives consistent pressure through physical journey and emotional discovery. The morpho wing's transformation and the vision of miners create meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Kael's absorption of the donor's stories, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of story magnetism—"they leave hollows in the world shaped exactly like themselves, and others, lonely as wind, slide inside." The morpho wing accumulates narrative until it glows, creating resonant imagery without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("rivers of mist rose and cooled against the floating rock, producing soft collisions that sounded like distant applause"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the vision sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The blue morpho wing, now saturated with narrative, no longer fluttered"). Some mild repetition of "valley-mist wonder" and occasional density that borders on overwriting ("quietly explosive"), but momentum remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of inheriting a storyteller's heart and tracking their final tale through sun trails and iridescent wings offers fresh conceptual synthesis. The story commits fully to its lyrical logic. Specific details like the tea house carved with travelers' names show originality in execution.</comment>
