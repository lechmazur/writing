I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered revelations about story magnetism rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hoshiko's transformation from passive recipient to active teacher of narrative invisibility is earned through concrete discoveries via the morpho wing. Her internal conflict between collecting vs. channeling stories manifests through embodied reactions to the donor heart's memories. The final choice to teach others narrative porosity carries visible cost—she must abandon her identity as dye master for this new purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Hoshiko transforms from story-vessel to story-channel, with the cost being her abandonment of mere craft mastery for teaching narrative invisibility. The accumulative structure coheres through the morpho wing's dissolution into pigment, creating a guide for others. Orientation anchors (floating teahouse, three moons post-surgery) establish clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock teahouse tethered by silk cables creates genuine spatial constraint—its drifting movement mirrors the story's meditation on narrative flow. The morpho wing's iridescent scales revealing "maps of places never visited but somehow known" directly enables Hoshiko's discoveries. Valley-mist imagery threads throughout, charging the final transformation where she learns to "become the valley-mist itself."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through layered revelations about the collector's theory, deepening from passive reception of memories to active discovery of narrative magnetism principles. The stakes—understanding why some people magnetize stories—remain consistent but lack urgent external pressure. The meaningful deepening occurs when Hoshiko realizes she must disappear into stories rather than collect them, though this arrives without resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of narrative porosity—people as channels vs. vessels for stories. The morpho wing's dissolution into pigment that creates a "map of story-ways" provides resonant non-literal answer to why some magnetize narratives. The concept of "disappearing inside stories" rather than claiming them offers genuine complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm through phrases like "quietly explosive sparks" and "valley-mist wonder." The perceptual signature—a dye master noticing how "indigo could hold both sky and ocean"—remains character-specific throughout. Some repetitive phrasing ("valley-mist wonder" appears 3x, "quietly explosive" 4x) slightly dulls distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive stems appear: "Hoshiko [verb]" opens 5 consecutive paragraphs mid-story, creating template cadence. The phrase "quietly explosive" recurs 4 times without variation, and "valley-mist wonder" appears 3 times identically. These loops dull momentum despite otherwise vivid imagery like "bees spelling names in honey."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of people as narrative channels rather than vessels offers fresh angle on storytelling meta-fiction. Specific details like "teaching bees to spell names in honey" and "tears turning to glass mid-fall" create memorable texture. However, the premise of receiving memories through organ donation is well-worn, limiting originality despite the specific execution.</comment>
