I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered metaphysical operations toward a resonant reconfiguration where Quince releases borrowed souls to restore both stars and self.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quince's internal contradiction between collecting personalities and losing himself drives genuine stakes, with the widow's grief and astronomer's logic creating embodied duality. The final choice to print himself "faint but legible" after releasing borrowed souls shows earned transformation with visible cost—his heart now "blank as unprinted paper, perfectly weightless and suddenly terrifying."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Quince reverses the press to release borrowed souls, restoring vanishing stars while accepting isolation—"to shine is to be alone together." The accumulative pattern of borrowed personalities → erosion → release coheres, with the halo fragment's seven rays creating new constellations that "spell the emotions he had tried to quantify" as tangible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and vanishing stars create atmospheric pressure, with the halo fragment constraining Quince's final choice. Details like "flywheel a slow heart" and the workshop doubling into "one room orderly, one room drowned in spectral tears" ground the metaphysical stakes in concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: borrowed grief → halo's autonomous message → astronomer's consciousness overlay → child of light revelation → the forced choice between keeping borrowed souls or restoring stars. The cost crystallizes when Quince must "scatter every borrowed soul he carried, returning them to owners who no longer existed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mathematics of emotion emerges through concrete operations—letterpress as personality transfer, empathy as subtraction rather than addition. The ending reweights the entire premise: "to feel is to let others go" transforms Quince's collecting into necessary release, with the cracked halo fragment becoming "a reminder that the mathematics of emotion ends not in proof but in release."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through letterpress metaphors ("leaden fractions of sense," "gutter of the page") and the texture shifts appropriately when channeling the widow versus astronomer. Some elevated diction ("eigenvalues of sorrow") fits the conceptual frame, though occasionally risks register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong image density, though some metaphysical abstractions ("lucid turbulence," "common denominator of longing") occasionally slow momentum. The letterpress vocabulary creates consistent texture, and key images like "stars burned steadily, having learned the equation" effectively merge the mathematical and emotional registers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of borrowed personalities eroding the self while stars vanish offers genuine freshness, with the letterpress-as-consciousness-transfer avoiding typical empathy tropes. The resolution—that empathy requires release rather than accumulation—inverts expected emotional mathematics, and the specific synthesis of printing/astronomy/emotion feels earned.</comment>
