<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction between rationality and involuntary feeling drives genuine tension, particularly in "I meant to drink, to finally silence the chorus" versus the final choice to "carry them more gently." The embodied fear ("I am afraid the quiet will be worse than the noise") and physical manifestation of emotion through the glass eye burning create authentic pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("fractured grace") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist shifts from seeking erasure to accepting burden, with visible cost in drinking the luminous mud and accepting the permanent vision change. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphysical elements build toward the final acceptance. Slight deduction for the ambiguous voice saying "Don't" which momentarily breaks established reality rules without clear payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard with dangling roots "like nooses" creates immediate spatial pressure, and the storm-battered environment actively constrains choices (branch falling, scattering the mixture). The glass eye's physical properties (growing hot, floating, settling in the scarred socket) directly enable the closure transformation. The ravine becomes internalized ("the ravine was inside me"), making setting essential to the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal desire for quiet to confronting the collective emotional burden, with the glass eye's intervention forcing a deeper choice. The protagonist's agency drives the final decision to drink "not to erase, but to carry them more gently," with clear cost in permanent altered vision. The falling branch creates genuine complication that forces adaptation rather than simple resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between isolation and connection, with the final image of teaching new truffles to "grow round the shape of what we cannot fix but can bear together" offering profound resonance. The recurring motif of roots as nooses transforming to "roots drinking the mixture" creates meaningful evolution. The concept of "cultivating psychological safety" deepens from muting others to holding them gently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines lyrical compression ("storms that tasted of other people's regrets") with precise sensory detail. POV control remains stable with consistent access to the narrator's interiority and embodied perception. Some register elevation in phrases like "fractured grace" and "translucent congregation" slightly strains against the forager's practical voice, though the overall texture remains compelling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("roots like nooses above the mist, and between them grew the black truffles"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("luminous film that crept toward my boots like curious children") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph's repeated "I [verb]" constructions, though the closing image lands with power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-viral emotional contagion with mystical cure-seeking through truffle foraging creates genuine originality. The specific detail of truffles that "remembered every unspoken farewell" and the glass eye that can see souls transforms familiar post-apocalyptic elements. Risk-taking in the surreal intervention ("a voice above me said, 'Don't'") and the luminous transformation sequence heightens stakes while maintaining coherence (+0.3).</comment>
