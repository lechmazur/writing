<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act throughout ("I wasn't seeking truth—I wanted safety" yet cannot bury the eye), with the final acceptance of the orchard as confessional earned through progressive revelations. The sister's ghost arrival and shared harvest crystallize the protagonist's transformation from isolated rationalist to participant in collective truth-telling, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds consistently with the orchard's transformation into a living confessional serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist's shift from forager to keeper carries visible cost ("knowing my words would be absorbed, composted"). The glass eyes multiplying and becoming lanterns that "taught us fractured grace" delivers conceptual repricing with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard with inverted trees and storm-polished glass eyes creates a vivid, constraining environment that directly shapes choices (cannot bury the eye, must stay as keeper). Setting actively participates in the resolution through the trees' absorption of confessions and transformation into next year's fruit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal safety through involuntary truth-telling to accepting role as orchard's keeper, with storms and the multiplying eyes creating coherent pressure. The cost is legible in the protagonist's transformation from "rational truffle forager" to one who "let[s] whatever needs saying fall out like loose seed," though the sister's arrival feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of cultivated confession versus wild truth, with the glass eyes becoming "lanterns" that teach "fractured grace—the art of holding broken things up to the light so they refract, not cut." The ending reweights psychological safety as communal rather than individual without stating this explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines rationalist precision with lyrical compression ("roots clung to the cliff like a man gripping a ledge with torn fingernails"), maintaining consistency through emotional intensification. The controlled rhythm and selective perception (focusing on spores, soil, storms) create a strong perceptual signature, though occasional phrases edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("fruit glowing pale as moonlit bones"), though some metaphorical density in high-pressure moments approaches excess ("threads like piano wire," "lightning calligraphy" in close succession). Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but occasional template structures appear ("I foraged, spoke cautiously to the wind, and waited").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The inverted orchard as living confessional and glass eyes that multiply into communal lanterns offer fresh synthesis of familiar elements (curses, relics, transformation). The specific resolution—accepting rather than burying truth, with the orchard composting confessions into fruit—feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
