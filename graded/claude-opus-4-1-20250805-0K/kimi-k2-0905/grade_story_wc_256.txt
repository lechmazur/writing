<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell ringer's transformation from collector to creator shows genuine progression with internal complexity, though her motivation feels somewhat abstract. The collectors function more as atmospheric presence than pressure-applying characters. The final choice to leave behind the lens and bells demonstrates meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the laboratory exploration toward a conceptual repricing where preservation transforms into creation. The closure lands with the bell ringer leaving her fragments behind (visible cost), though the transformation feels more asserted than dramatized. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The laboratory setting with its "cathedral of forgotten frequencies" and "artificial pilgrimage routes" creates atmosphere but doesn't strongly constrain choices. The carbide lamp lens functions as a recurring object that helps charge the final transformation. Golden shadows provide consistent tonal threading though setting could pressure action more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering "texture of connection") progresses from mourning silence to creating new sounds, with the bell ringer's question serving as the pivot. However, escalation feels conceptual rather than pressured—the collectors' immediate acquiescence lacks resistance or complication. Cost appears in leaving objects behind but tension remains mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation from preservation to creation, with the final question "why do we mourn the silence when we could be learning its music?" offering resonance. The piece avoids explicit moralizing and lets the laboratory's transformation carry meaning. Some abstraction ("texture of connection") weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "prism-song bell ringer" and "cathedral of forgotten frequencies." POV control stays clean in third-person limited. Some phrases feel elevated beyond necessity ("powerfully gentle weight," "artificial pilgrimage") creating occasional register drift that doesn't quite earn its abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose tends toward the abstract with phrases like "texture of connection" and "powerfully gentle" appearing multiple times without concrete grounding. Some repetitive structures emerge ("She had come to discover," "She walked back"). The piece maintains readability but lacks the precision and momentum needed for higher scores—too much telling about transformation rather than showing it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of a "laboratory of lost sounds" offers an interesting premise, and the shift from preservation to creation provides a non-obvious angle. However, execution relies on familiar workshop tropes (finding voice, collective transformation) without sufficient specificity to feel fresh. The bell ringer's journey follows predictable beats.</comment>
