I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage, with the final seed-planting serving as a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ari's motivation to preserve seed knowledge is embodied through concrete actions (coaxing rope, reading knots, planting seed). Her "infinite patience" manifests believably in deliberate movements and resistance to bureaucratic pressure. The harbormaster provides effective oppositional pressure though remains somewhat one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Ari plants the storm-corn seed in the dock's snow, with the shoot's emergence and rope's braiding of light confirming the weavers' continuity. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through rope-reading, fulgurite glass, and seed knowledge. Cost is visible in the confrontation risked and the death of the last tide-weaver, though the resolution feels slightly too neat with the magical plant growth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity: "golden dock under snow creaked like whale-bone," "fulgurite glass fused into fibers," "roots threading salt-soaked wood." The harbor setting actively constrains choices (Ari must work at the pier's edge, fog enables escape). The micro-setting of rope-as-text brilliantly merges object and environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving the storm-corn's planting method before it's lost forever. Pressure escalates through the harbormaster's arrival and attempted confiscation. However, the magical resolution (instant plant growth, convenient fog) somewhat deflates the earned tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of knots as language and seeds as cultural memory. The final image of "braided fibers of light" resonates without stating its meaning. Subtext operates effectively through Ari's actions versus the harbormaster's regulations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with oceanic rhythm: "fog folded thick between them, erasing outline, erasing urgency." Perceptual signature strong in how Ari reads rope like text. The harbormaster's bureaucratic register effectively contrasts Ari's lyrical perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She planted it then, there, in the thin snow dusting the dock plank, pressing it into the grain with the same reverence a priest plants ashes." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("accordion," "midwife") but mostly serves the oceanic tone. Minor redundancy in the final paragraph's multiple restatements of continuity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of lightning-struck rope as readable text is genuinely inventive. The synthesis of maritime tradition, botanical knowledge, and cryptographic practice creates something memorable. Risk-taking in the magical realism elements heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
