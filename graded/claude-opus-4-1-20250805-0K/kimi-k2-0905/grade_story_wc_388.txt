<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's internal conflict between her past role as debunker and current truth-seeker creates genuine tension, with her final choice to broadcast the lies showing meaningful character agency. The diamond's playback forcing her to confront her own complicity ("even her own younger self reciting reassurances") provides embodied emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional processing during the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the orchard's transformation (apples browning, releasing glass seeds) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—truth accelerating decay. The diamond's curse elegantly reframes from punishment to "perfect memory," and Marisol's decision to make it a permanent broadcast station shows agency with visible consequence. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard with crystallizing bark and hexagonal scars creates a vivid, constraining environment that directly shapes Marisol's search method and final choice. The stillpoint functions as both literal location and conceptual refuge, while the poisoned apples' glow provides working light—setting as active participant. The final image of browning fruit embodies the story's central cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to systemic reckoning as Marisol discovers the diamond forces confrontation with collective lies, not just individual truth. The stillpoint's discovery through resonance ("hummed the Coalition's sign-off tone") shows earned progression. Cost manifests viscerally through "tasted copper and shame" and the final decay of preserved lies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of preservation/decay, with radioactive fruit bearing "hexagonal scars" that mirror the archive's tessellation—pattern as meaning. The diamond's transformation from curse to broadcast device reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Final image of truth accelerating rot delivers resonant answer to whether comfortable lies or painful truths better serve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scientific precision ("sub-root 7A," "tessellation") with poetic compression ("dust hissed," "ghost tides"), creating character-specific perception. Controlled psychic distance maintains Marisol's analytical nature even under stress. The prose rhythm appropriately compresses during the playback sequence, though occasional elevated diction ("palimpsest") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"clicked like an angry cicada" establishes danger, sound, and atmosphere simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for one instance of elevated diction ("deliberate palimpsest") that doesn't quite fit Marisol's practical voice, and slight opacity in the "reassembled letters, now wet with sap" transition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of nuclear disaster, truth-recording diamond, and orchard-as-archive creates a genuinely fresh apocalyptic mythology. The inversion where radiation preserves lies while truth causes decay offers non-obvious insight. Risk-taking in the dense symbolic system pays off through concrete dramatization, earning +0.3 within band for coherent ambition.</comment>
