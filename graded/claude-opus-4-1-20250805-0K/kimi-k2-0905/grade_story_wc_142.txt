I'll evaluate this literary story according to the demanding editorial standards provided.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with the reorganization serving as a density shift that reweights the carnival's meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through her graffiti encoding and story-translating role. The foundation stone chip functions as embodied attachment throughout. Minor deduction for the resistance assembly feeling slightly coordinated rather than chaotic under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the carnival "unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved" crystallizing options with felt cost. The overnight reorganization serves as meaningful density shift under Accumulative lens. Deduction for the Syndicate's retreat feeling somewhat convenient without showing their specific confusion beyond "radios crackling."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The raft city's physicality constrains choices throughout - "lashed together from pontoons, freight pallets" creates precarity that drives action. The reorganized layout (gaming barges swapped with libraries) uses setting to charge the final standoff. Strong sensory hierarchy through Lina's navigation of "popcorn smoke" and "gold-toothed pipes."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulation - from negotiators measuring decks to graffiti resistance to overnight reorganization, each layer deepening stakes. The "foundation questioned" debate whether to scuttle creates genuine cost consideration. Limited by the Syndicate's somewhat passive antagonism and their easy retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the carnival as perpetual becoming versus ownership, with the final line "unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The foundation stone's dual meaning (lifted/dropped) enriches the preservation/transformation paradox. Slight deduction for "capital would return with bigger barges" feeling predictive rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through inventive compression: "every dusk, strings of bulbs flickered on to keep the dark from remembering land prices." Perceptual signature strong in how Lina reads corporate colors as "wrong." The fire-eater's burning cursive and children speaking "only in riddles" maintains surreal consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "jugglers and oyster poachers" establishes both carnival chaos and economic survival. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful fragments. Minor deduction for "hopeful desperation flickering across their faces like投射的火花" containing an untranslated fragment that breaks flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival as anti-development space offers fresh angle on gentrification through specific lived detail. The graffiti resistance code and overnight spatial reorganization as protest feel inventive. Risk-taking in the surreal-realist hybrid heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
