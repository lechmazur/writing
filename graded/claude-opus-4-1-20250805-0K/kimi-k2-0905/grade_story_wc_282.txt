I'll evaluate this story through the lens of immediate publishability at elite literary venues.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory mapping, thermal glyphs, and resonant imagery toward a conceptual transformation where Aera becomes the voice bridging silence and witness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aera's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (collecting thermal glyphs, pressing fossil to sternum), with contradictory impulses shown in scene when she collapses yet rises "lighter by the mass of one fear." The transformation from mapper to voice is earned through physical cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("an ache older than grammar").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the fossil transforms from transitional object to "lighthouse without fire," with visible cost (Aera dissolving into rumor). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through heat-mapping to vocal transformation, though the mid-section's memory glimpses briefly strain causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave setting actively constrains and enables choices - salt-curtains, tide line placement, mineral floor warming "as mammal skin." The elm fossil functions as micro-setting that literally transforms the space's emotional temperature and charges the final image of the floating staff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mapping emotions to becoming their voice, with the fossil's cold node disrupting Aera's method and forcing physical transformation. The cost is legible when "each sonic layer wrapped itself around the fossil" drains her body, though the pressure could tighten more sharply between discovery and transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fossil as bridge "between silences" and Aera's transformation into witness. The final image of the floating staff as "lighthouse without fire" offers a non-literal answer about persistence of memory and voice that reweights all prior mapping work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("turquoise hush," "salt-curtains") and clear perceptual signature focused on thermal/emotional residue. The fossil section's elevated register ("crowns shading council fires") serves the transformative moment, though occasionally reaches for abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots never quite touching the wet stone" establishes both otherworldliness and careful observation). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("an ache older than grammar") but rhythm varies purposefully and propels toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human witness with sensory cartography creates something genuinely original. The concept of heat-mapping emotions into "topographies of color" and the fossil as temporal bridge between silences shows risk-taking that heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
