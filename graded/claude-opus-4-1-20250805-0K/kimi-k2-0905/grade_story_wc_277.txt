I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through metaphorical layers and conceptual density rather than strict causality, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where regret transforms from "orbit" to "cage" to something wider.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cordelia's motivation to break her orbit of regret is clear and embodied through the splintered rosewood nib. Her internal contradiction between preserving family legacy and exposing truth plays out through concrete actions. The "proof by contradiction" method reveals character through intellectual approach to emotional wounds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "Regret that cannot accommodate new truth is not orbit but cage." The transformation from fixed orbit to "spacious sky" carries visible cost through the splintered nib and "empty space where gravity had once insistently tugged." The accumulative structure builds through astronomical metaphor to earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory constrains choices through its astronomical tools—the clockwork projector enables the confrontation, the dome becomes canvas for rewriting. "Starlight dripped through the slit roof and pooled on the slate floor" establishes atmosphere while the funicular descent marks spatial transition. Setting functions as more than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from inscribing assumptions to forcing contradictions to breaking the nib. The orbit "flared white, refusing the contradiction" before finally cracking open. Cost is legible in the splintered rosewood—destroying the grandfather's relic to destroy the false orbit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orbit metaphor transforms from prison to "spacious sky" where "future truths join the dance." The broken nib becoming "unbylined relic smiling between lines" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Theme emerges through the mathematical proof method applied to emotional truth: rigid patterns must break to accommodate new evidence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains "solemn playfulness" throughout—"toy among toys," "forgiving hearts," "respectfully distant, tipping its hat." The perceptual signature is distinct: Cordelia counts orbits, notices ink scents, thinks in headlines. Dr. Orlan's minimal dialogue carries appropriate reserve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence: "newsprint heiress who smelled of ink and thunder," "starlings scattering into night." Some overwriting appears mid-story ("glowing words collided with the headline, showering sparks") and occasional abstraction ("protagonists passivity"). Information density generally high with purposeful rhythm variations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The proof-by-contradiction method for emotional healing is fresh—mathematical logic applied to psychological orbit. The splintered nib that writes despite breaking transforms expected resolution. "Observatory as playground for absent gods" and astronomical projection of personal regret offer non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
