<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cordelia's internal conflict between inherited shame and the need for truth manifests through concrete actions (writing across the sky, breaking the rosewood nib). The contradiction between preserving her grandfather's relic and destroying it to break the orbit shows layered motivation. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("regret that orbited her heart") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the orbit metaphor building density through proof by contradiction until the nib breaks, creating a Decisive Change when the ellipse "cracked open like a flawed headline retracted." The cost is visible in the splintered family heirloom and the "empty space where gravity had once insistently tugged." Minor deduction for slightly abstract opening that takes time to anchor the metaphysical premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice through its specialized equipment (clockwork projector, antique stylus) that enables the sky-writing intervention. Sensory details like "starlight dripped through the slit roof and pooled on the slate floor" create atmosphere while the "copper dome" and "spiral stairs" provide clear spatial anchoring. The setting doesn't fully charge the final image, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (breaking the orbit of regret) escalates through the proof by contradiction sequence, with each inscription forcing higher cost until the nib breaks. The tightening from "Assume the orbit is eternal" to "Regret that cannot accommodate new truth is not orbit but cage" shows clear progression. Agency manifests in Cordelia's choice to destroy the heirloom for truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The proof by contradiction method becomes the thematic engine—false permanence must break when confronted with new evidence. The splintered rosewood nib embodies the cost of breaking cycles, while "stories keep orbiting, just wider, gentler" offers complex resolution without tidy closure. The theme emerges entirely through action and image, never stated directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with phrases like "smelled of ink and thunder" and "a solemn playground where broken nibs rewrote gravity." POV remains consistently close third with controlled psychic distance. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("devotedly observant of every new star that chose not to fall") that doesn't fully match Cordelia's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("starlight dripped through the slit roof") and varied sentence structures. However, some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("gears groaned like old editors arguing deadlines") and occasional template cadence in the middle section. The "devotedly observant" phrase repeats verbatim three times, creating a minor loop pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of using astronomical equipment to literally rewrite emotional orbits through proof by contradiction is highly original. The synthesis of journalism, astronomy, and mathematical logic creates a fresh angle on confronting family shame. Risk-taking in the metaphysical premise heightens stakes while maintaining clarity through concrete action.</comment>
