<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirelle's internal journey from seeking to catalog silences to understanding the clasp as "a tuning fork shaped like a question" shows genuine transformation with visible cost. The contradiction between her pacifist identity (velvet patches over bullet holes) and her sister's choice to join a war creates sustained internal conflict that drives her actions. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("Silence of the Almost," "Silence of the Already") that leans toward label-speak rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Mirelle discovers the clasp was "never meant to lock anything away" but rather broadcast "a lighthouse for anyone learning the path to empathy," with visible cost in her tears and the release of her sister's memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as she tunes through different frequencies of silence, each building toward the final understanding. Orientation anchors establish who/where/when clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop setting with its "broken music boxes, each one a throat that had forgotten its song" constrains Mirelle's search and provides the radio that enables her discovery. Sensory details (sawdust/gunpowder smell, cedar/iron textures) are filtered through her specific perception. The fireworks outside create temporal pressure and contrast with the interior silence she seeks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the tuning sequence as each frequency reveals deeper layers of silence, from the room's heartbeat to her sister's escape to her own childhood plea, culminating in finding "the frequency of forgiveness." The approaching fireworks create temporal pressure ("she knew she had seconds"). Cost is visible in her tears and the final relinquishment of the clasp, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without significant resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story's exploration of silence as containing multitudes ("each one a small pacifist soldier returning home") resonates beyond the immediate plot, with the final image of Mirelle walking away as citizenship in "a country whose only border was the moment before noise begins." The child who "chose not to grow up angry" extends the theme without forcing a moral. Subtext operates beautifully through the clasp's transformation from lock to tuning fork.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("shelves sagged under broken music boxes") and character-specific perception ("cedar smelled like truce, iron like surrender"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains against naturalism ("elongated moment," "eternal final stillness"). The perceptual signature remains distinct throughout, though register occasionally drifts toward the overly poetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("chrysanthemum of sound," "velvet flags of a country") but suffers from occasional overwriting and density issues. Several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("theatrical sincerity" appears twice, "eclectic pacifist" feels forced). Some metaphors strain clarity ("furniture" being rearranged in her chest). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging varieties of silence through radio frequencies offers a fresh angle on grief and forgiveness. The transformation of the diary clasp from lock to tuning fork to broadcast beacon shows genuine conceptual innovation. The integration of pacifist philosophy with personal loss avoids easy resolution.</comment>
