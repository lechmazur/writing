Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds density through layered silences and frequencies toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirelle's characterization succeeds through embodied perception ("set her ear to the rusted safe") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (pacifist who wears "velvet patches over bullet holes she had never earned"). Her choice to sing rather than force the lock demonstrates earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("she understood") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mirelle becomes "a walking archive of silences safely converted into song" with clear cost ("Your silence is safe with me"). The accumulative lens holds as frequencies layer toward the diary's opening at 714 kHz. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (workshop location unclear initially) though this serves the atmospheric opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal radio and diary function as micro-setting that constrains choice beautifully ("she had waited, because pacifists know that violence done to metal echoes in flesh"). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV priorities well. Some spatial choreography could be clearer in the workshop, but the frequency-based environment effectively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through frequency progression (200-400-600-714 kHz) with each silence variety deepening stakes. The diary's clasp warming and eventual opening provides meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in Mirelle's choice to carry stories "in her bloodstream." Slightly mechanical progression of silence types prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the taxonomy of silences and the physical act of resonance as empathy. The final image of Mirelle as "walking archive" with the glowing diode "like a star that had learned to listen" offers a non-literal answer to empathy's mechanics. Strong integration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the hush inside the hush," "chrysanthemum bloom of fire"). POV maintains consistent distance and the perceptual signature is unique. Some register elevation in peak moments ("intuitively descriptive") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Deductions for template cadence in the silence catalog section ("the silence of fathers... the silence of flags... the silence that follows") and some abstract phrasing ("theatrical sincerity turning pain into performance"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging silence varieties through radio frequencies is fresh and specific. The transformation of a pacifist's relationship to violence through resonance rather than force shows genuine ingenuity. Some familiar post-war imagery prevents higher score.</comment>
