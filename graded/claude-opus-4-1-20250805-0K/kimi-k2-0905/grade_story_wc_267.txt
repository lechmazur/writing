<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bellhop's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars—the piano bolt as anchor, his mother's silenced lullaby, the boy's severed vocal cords—with contradictory impulses (preserve/resist silence) acting simultaneously in scene. The final non-choice to "remain" as sentinel earns its weight through accumulated cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("fortress shift, microscopic fracture").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design builds through layered silence imagery toward Charged Poise: the bellhop's crystallized waiting while the fortress decides "whether safety was worth the price." Cost is legible through the boy's severed cords and generations of stolen voices, though the "microscopic fracture" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress constrains every choice through its silence decree, while micro-settings (dusty staircase discoloration, piano bolt's weight, meltwater constellations) carry embodied memory and resistance. The fortress as breathing entity that "decides" charges the final image powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding silence's cost) deepens through the boy's arrival with severed cords, forcing the bellhop's recognition of the "ledger of safety: one voice subtracted." The piano bolt transfer and final waiting crystallize agency through endurance, though escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the bolt as "seraphically mundane" anchor, the discoloration marking generations of compliance—culminating in the resonant final question about safety's price. The imagined future where the boy might "let it roll across the stones, a single note struck" offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through silence's weight ("air tasted of metal and old songs," "hush that was not hush but the high whine"). Consistent free indirect style maintains psychic distance while modulating with emotional intensity, particularly in the ward scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("cobalt fortress under snow had stood for three centuries, its walls absorbing every footstep, every scream, every whispered prayer"). Some abstract moments ("microscopic fracture," "fortress shift") and occasional filter constructions ("he felt," "he knew") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silence decree as response to trauma ("last siege left half the garrison screaming themselves awake") transforms a potential dystopian cliché through specific embodiment. The piano bolt as mundane resistance object and the fortress-as-entity that decides fates show genuine originality.</comment>
