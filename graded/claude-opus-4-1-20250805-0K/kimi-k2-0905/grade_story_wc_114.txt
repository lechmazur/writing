<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oracle's internal contradiction between swallowing truth to protect and needing to expel it drives authentic pressure through embodied sensation ("rootlet pierce her diaphragm"). The final renunciation of the truth-stone earns its cost through prior accumulation of weight metaphors. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("auroral sorrow") that briefly distances from embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly through the truth-stone's expulsion and burial, with visible cost ("4.7 grams of sorrow"). The accumulative lens holds as density increases from fever-break to rootlet-piercing to stone-expulsion. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 (mountain station, post-fever). The "valley temporarily innocent" closure reweights the protection paradox with earned stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The botanical illustration constrains choice (must be smudged to release internal truth) and charges the final burial image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the oracle's liminal perception ("tasting iron and pine resin," "chlorophyll sorrow"). The mountain station's instruments ("barograph's trembling hairline") function as micro-setting that shapes her transcription ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: seed becomes weight becomes rootlet becomes stone, each stage forcing embodied response. The oracle's agency drives the smudging ritual and stone expulsion with visible cost. The "heavier" repetition and aurora's arrival create temporal pressure that forces action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weight/truth paradox without statement—protection requires digestion but digestion requires expulsion. The blank botanical illustration with "torn silhouette" offers resonant answer to the burden of knowing. Subtext operates through the instruments' warnings and the "unused name" comparison.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic blending ("tasting...auroral light," "chlorophyll sorrow"). Voice modulates from fever-dream opening to clinical final entry. Consistent liminal focalization catches peripheral shadows and half-glimpsed certainties without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Snow hissed against shutters; the anemometer spun above, counting heartbeats no one claimed"). Clear propulsion through varied syntax. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("foxed by decades") and abstract compounds ("auroral sorrow") that momentarily blur immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle reading marginal certainties offers fresh angle on prophetic burden. The truth-as-seed-as-stone transformation feels earned through accumulative logic. Some derivative elements (mountain hermit, mystical burden) are transformed through specific sensory work but don't fully escape archetype.</comment>
