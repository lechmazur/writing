<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vale's transformation from researcher to embodiment of the wraith shows clear motivation rooted in grief over her mentor's disappearance, with the flint arrowhead serving as a concrete anchor for her emotional journey. The metamorphosis feels earned through accumulated bitterness becoming "buoyant," though some abstract phrasing ("harmony untamed," "frequency that turned grief into levity") weakens embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Vale's investigation culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes the wraith herself, accepting that "the wraith was never the monster, but the punchline we become when we finally let go." Cost is visible as Vale abandons her old life and literally shatters through the ceiling, though the transformation's mechanics rely heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underground garden with floating herbs and gravity-defying vines creates vivid sensory detail that directly shapes the narrative—the environment's gravitational anomalies mirror and enable Vale's transformation. The frost imagery threads throughout ("frost clung to the roots," "frost crystallizing into laughter") to charge the final tone of "frostbitten hope."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the wraith and finding the mentor—escalates through the phone confession revealing the mentor's present voice, then deepens when Vale realizes her bitterness is "the final ingredient." The transformation carries cost (Vale leaves her old life), though agency becomes passive as she "allowed the arrowhead to guide her metamorphosis" rather than actively choosing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the central metaphor of transforming bitterness into cosmic jokes, with the wraith representing "the part of you that learned to laugh at the void." The ending image of Vale dancing among stars while "bending telephone wires into question marks" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, though occasional abstract phrasing ("harmony untamed") weakens concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Vale with lyrical flourishes that match the surreal tone ("gravity danced like a drunk marionette"). However, the narrative occasionally drifts into omniscient territory with unexplained knowledge ("The herbalist watched without surprise, having grown accustomed...") and relies on abstract register that strains against embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of striking imagery ("laughter bending telephone wires into question marks") but suffers from abstract conceptual language that dulls immediacy ("harmony untamed," "frequency that turned grief into levity"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("the wraith was never the monster" concept repeated across multiple formulations) and the story leans heavily on telling pivotal transformations rather than showing them through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a cryptid that turns out to be a psychological/gravitational transformation state offers genuine freshness, particularly the final revelation that researchers become what they hunt. The integration of cosmic humor with grief and the specific image of "telephone wires bent into question marks" creates memorable originality, though some elements feel derivative of surreal fiction tropes.</comment>
