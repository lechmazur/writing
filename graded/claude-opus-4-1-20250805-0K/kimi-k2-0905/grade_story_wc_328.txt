<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal transformation from skeptical researcher to winged being is earned through accumulating physical changes (bruise, scales) and recovered memory, with visible cost in her human form "cracking open." However, diagnostic label-speak ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") in peak beats and some emotional arithmetic in the metamorphosis sequence prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's transformation, with clear cost (loss of human form) and the city's collective change. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the metamorphosis. Orientation anchors (underground garden, catacombs) establish by ~100 words, though the rapid scope expansion in the final third strains coherence slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underground garden with its "moon-white mandrake" and "spiral staircase of living vines" creates vivid micro-setting that enables key choices (staying to record, climbing to meet the creature). The arrowhead and phone function as setting-objects that constrain action. Some generic elements ("pale green" dawn) and the rushed rooftop transition prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating sightings to personal transformation, with the arrowhead warming and bruise unfurling as physical pressures that force Mara's choice. The dominant stake (understanding the vanished hikers' transformation) tightens when she realizes she's "the setup" to a cosmic joke, though the final city-wide transformation dilutes individual cost slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of transformation as "harmony untamed" emerges through concrete metamorphosis rather than statement, with the recurring joke/punchline motif providing coherent subtext. However, explicit thematic echoes ("harmony untamed is just another name for love that refuses to behave") and the final paragraph's diagnostic language reduce resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive lyrical register with inventive phrases ("moon-white mandrake," "gravitationally playful fireflies"), though register drift into elevated diction ("benedictions," "incandescent") clashes with Mara's researcher POV. The dialogue (phone confessions) carries genuine subtext but limited samples prevent full assessment. Some template cadence in the transformation sequence ("She climbed... She circled... She glanced") reduces distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong inventive imagery ("cordless phone crackled like a throat full of ice") and varied sentence structures create momentum. However, paraphrase loops ("frostbitten hope" appears 3 times), template cadence runs in action sequences, and some overwriting in figurative language ("gravitationally playful" used twice) prevent higher scoring. The prose achieves density but sacrifices some clarity in the rush to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of researcher becoming the phenomenon she studies offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives, with specific details (moth-wings, spiral bruises, phone confessions) creating originality. The integration of cosmic joke with scientific investigation feels organic. Risk-taking in the surreal metamorphosis sequence heightens stakes, though some elements feel derivative of established weird fiction tropes.</comment>
