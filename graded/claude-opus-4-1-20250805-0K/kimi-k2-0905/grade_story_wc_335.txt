<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's backwards walking and her choice between forgetting/remembering creates genuine internal conflict with embodied specificity. The mentor-child parallel and Lira's "smile the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut" show contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract moments ("combative tenderness toward her own fate") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Lira rewrites the exile's terms to allow the child to return without forgetting. The imprisoned afternoon shadow's release and library's exhalation create visible transformation with clear cost (Lira remembering for both). Slight deduction for orientation requiring inference in early paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library with its "warped doorway," imprisoned shadow, and breathing shelves constrains choices throughout. Mirror shards on Lira's coat and the swing's ghost create vivid micro-settings that shape action. The teacup's positioning and the shadow's final release directly enable closure transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reversible exile's cruel bargain (return home but forget why you wanted to) establishes clear stakes that deepen when Lira discovers she could save the library by becoming "bound and shelved." Her choice to rewrite the exile for the child shows agency with visible cost. Escalation through accumulation works under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the final line "Resilience is walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you" which reweights all prior backwards movement. The mentor's wordless teaching and Lira's continuation of this pattern create layered meaning about knowledge transmission and sacrifice without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive constructions ("shard-mirror archivist," "the hush felt like an empty playground swing"). Controlled psychic distance and clean focalization throughout. Some moments of elevated diction ("reversible exile rewritten into a loop") slightly strain the established register but serve the fantastical premise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied syntax create momentum, particularly "she smiled the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut." Some abstract phrases ("combative tenderness," "quiet defiance") and occasional density in figurative language reduce clarity. The final image lands with precision and power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reversible exile concept—remembering means permanent exile, forgetting allows return—offers genuine originality. The backwards walking as both nervous tic and philosophical stance, plus the mentor/student wordless teaching tradition, create fresh synthesis. Risk-taking in the dense symbolic system pays off at closure (+0.3).</comment>
