I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered iterations of the lullaby and nested temporal patterns rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The adjuster's internal conflict between duty and maternal memory creates genuine tension through embodied details like "fingers trembled" and the physical kiss to the puppet. The choice to sacrifice herself emerges naturally from accumulated emotional pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bruised awe") that briefly distances from immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the adjuster accepts eternal imprisonment to save futures. The nested lullaby iterations and recursive temporal structure teach their pattern early and pay off at closure with visible cost ("body eroding like sandstone into salt"). The orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, lantern room) establish clearly within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse's spiral architecture mirrors the story's nested structure brilliantly—"each railing curl a smaller echo of the one below." The pane of hush functions as both literal object and conceptual constraint that shapes the final choice. Setting actively participates in the resolution rather than merely hosting it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the lullaby's iterations, each revealing greater cost until the final bargain crystallizes. The adjuster's agency drives the accumulation—she chooses each recursive loop knowing it brings her closer to dissolution. The visible price ("voice eternally whispering, body eroding") lands with undeniable weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of "imperfection was the only song worth singing" and the puppet's "beautifully flawed crescent." The final line's triple repetition "I am here" resonates as both presence and absence, transforming the lullaby into an act of witness. No explicit moralizing; meaning accumulates through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"salt-stained iron," "drinking the orange afterglow." The perceptual signature remains consistent through stress, tracking minute details like "cloudy marble" eyes while maintaining emotional pressure. Rhythm accelerates through shorter iterations during the lullaby sequence, then slows for the denouement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"nested patterns of salt-stained iron" simultaneously describes, metaphorizes, and foreshadows. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("vouchsafe") that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of recursive time and nested realities offers genuine freshness—particularly the inversion where silence becomes music "on the far side of hearing." The puppet head as emotional anchor transforms a potential cliché into earned specificity. Risk-taking in the non-linear temporal structure heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3).</comment>
