<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maela's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—her chisel ringing against wood, the physical wedging of the slide into driftwood—with internal conflict between "gift or geas" driving toward a costly choice. The final renunciation of GPS for "the unmarked map the storm had drawn across her palms" shows genuine transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("perpetually learning the grammar of currents") that occasionally distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Maela's carved archway becomes a "pocket throat through which any journeyer might speak and be heard by every age at once," transforming both object and sculptor. Cost is legible in her choice to abandon GPS navigation for storm-drawn knowledge. The pattern of shadows-to-solidity and the spiral motif charging the final image create coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway functions as both setting and constraint, forcing Maela's choices while the "basalt throat that swallowed half the horizon" becomes ledger and record. Sensory specificity excels—"shipwreck and pine pitch," foam hurling across lenses, the turbine-hum of centuries. The miniature archway charging the final image directly links environment to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as projected shadows gain weight and Maela's carving becomes an act of historical witness. The dominant stake—whether the slide is "gift or geas"—resolves through costly action as she abandons modern navigation for ancient knowledge. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "timewoven alliances" that never fully crystallizes into immediate physical danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of old/new navigation, with the carved archway becoming a communication channel across ages. The final image of Maela rowing with "the archway behind her now singing in two voices: stone and sculpted, echo and answer" offers resonant synthesis without stating a moral. Subtext operates beautifully through the GPS's "nervous bird" chirping against chosen abandonment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"the turbine-hum rose, no longer imagination but the actual spin of centuries inside the slide." POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the storm-action context ("timewoven alliances threading through her chisel") and some filter-verb accumulation in contemplative passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"She wedged the lantern slide into the fissure so moon and lightning could duel inside the glass." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("gears of salt and starlight") and abstract phrasing ("reimagining darkness into layered meanings") that occasionally obscures immediacy. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression elsewhere prevent lower scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of driftwood sculpting with magical projection creates fresh synthesis, particularly the slide that "rearranged itself whenever moonlight struck." The concept of an archway as historical ledger and the carved miniature becoming a trans-temporal communication device shows genuine originality. The specific detail of pulling the slide from a "sun-bleached whale rib" grounds the fantastical in tactile reality.</comment>
