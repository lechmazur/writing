<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maela's motivation is clear and rooted in her relationship with found materials and ancient patterns, driving her to carve despite the storm. Her internal experience effectively layers discovery with craft ("perpetually learning the grammar of currents"), though some moments drift toward abstraction ("timewoven alliances"). The final choice to abandon GPS for "the unmarked map the storm had drawn across her palms" shows meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (shadows, spirals, fleet projections) that culminates in Maela creating a miniature archway that allows communication across ages. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she rows away having chosen intuitive navigation over technology, with cost visible in her "battered skiff" and drowned GPS. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway functions as both setting and active participant, its "ancient basalt throat" becoming a ledger of debts and rescues that constrains Maela's carving choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("chisel ringing like a small bell," "turbine-hum," "smell of shipwreck and pine pitch"), though occasionally over-dense. The miniature archway Maela creates directly mirrors the environment, showing setting's constraint on the final artifact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the slide is "gift or geas"—signals early and deepens when Maela discovers the archway is a ledger requiring her participation. Escalation occurs through the slide's projection gaining weight until shadows "leaned against the archway as if pushing it open," forcing Maela to carve with rather than against the wood's memory. The cost manifests in her abandoning modern navigation for uncertain intuitive guidance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring spiral motif and the concept of "timewoven alliances" that layer past and future obligations without explicit moralizing. The final image of Maela rowing with "the archway behind her now singing in two voices: stone and sculpted, echo and answer" offers resonant resolution to questions of tradition versus innovation. Subtext operates effectively through the GPS failure forcing reliance on older navigation methods.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Maela with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the carving sequence. Voice has distinctive texture in phrases like "turbine-hum reverie" and "the grammar of currents," though occasionally strains toward elevated register ("timewoven alliances of sailors, traders, exiles"). No dialogue appears, allowing sustained interiority that matches the solitary setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments ("chisel ringing like a small bell against salt-gray wood") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Some phrases approach purple prose ("gears of salt and starlight"), and abstract formulations like "timewoven alliances" recur without gaining clarity. Information density is high but occasionally sacrifices momentum for atmospheric accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The piece freshly combines maritime folklore with magic realism through the specific detail of a lantern slide found in whale bone that projects historical debts. The transformation of GPS failure from loss to "permission" offers a non-obvious angle on technology versus tradition. Risk-taking in the dense, lyrical approach heightens the mythic quality, though the "timewoven alliances" concept remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
