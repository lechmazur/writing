<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma work with the poet's scars as both physical and emotional terrain, particularly effective in the boiling water memory sequence. The internal contradiction between censorship and expression drives consistent micro-choices through developing photos and writing on stone. Minor deduction for some abstract moments ("furiously tranquil precision") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with density increasing through photo development revealing trauma maps. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the darkroom becomes "planetarium of scars" with visible cost in phosphorescing chemicals. Orientation anchors poet/observatory/storm clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the incomplete final sentence and some causality softness in how photos suddenly overlay with island maps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory-as-darkroom constrains choices brilliantly—the poet must use photographic processes to develop both images and memories. Red safelight, developer trays, and stone walls become active participants. The storm's electrical interference with equipment shapes the revelation sequence. Setting transcends description to become method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming censored trauma into visible testimony, with escalation through photo development revealing deeper layers of damage. The timer's cycles create pressure, and lightning strikes force revelations. Cost is legible in "borders of pain redrawn as borders of belonging." Some softness in how external storm pressure directly forces internal choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete darkroom metaphor: developing photos parallels developing/accepting trauma rather than erasing it. The line "When masks slip we do not become faces, we become weather" resonates without moralizing. Scars-as-cartography motif accumulates meaning through physical overlays. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("bureaucracy of silence").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges poetic compression with technical darkroom precision. Perceptual signature strong in how the poet reads everything through censorship/revelation lens. Some exceptional moments ("each footstep erasing the city's ink from her skin"). Slight register elevation in places ("rarefied the air") that doesn't fully match the intimate trauma work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong image-making ("sealed envelope wedged in an old bus timetable like a prayer between rusted hours"). However, several instances of elevated diction strain clarity ("thunder rarefied the air," "furiously tranquil precision") and the incomplete final sentence disrupts closure momentum. Some density overload in metaphor-heavy passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship trauma through darkroom photography creates non-obvious angle. The specific detail of military censors who "slit and resealed so many times the paper itself resembled scar tissue" transforms familiar trauma narrative. Risk-taking in the incomplete ending and dense metaphorical layering mostly succeeds.</comment>
