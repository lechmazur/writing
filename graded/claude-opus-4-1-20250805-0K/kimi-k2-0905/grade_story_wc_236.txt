<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's loss of smell drives genuine internal conflict through concrete embodied details like reading metal "between lines" and letting "absence itself become aroma." The final choice to carry the midwife's screw as a keepsake shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("maps of emotional terrain") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts her loss and finds new purpose through touch/story rather than scent, with the midwife's screw as catalyst. The closure lands with felt cost as she walks into the city "reading between lines only the heart can translate." Who/where/when anchored early; causal linkage from discovery to insight to acceptance holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The water clock's mechanical details and the midwife's screw constrain Mira's investigation and enable her final insight. Sensory selection appropriately shifts from absent smell to heightened touch/sound. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("diaphragm contracting in slow motion") that doesn't fully ground the physical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Central stake of finding meaning after sensory loss deepens through Mira's tactile discovery of the screw's story, building to her acceptance that "maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss as by landmark." The cost is legible as she pockets the screw to "midwife" future stories. Slight deduction for resolution feeling somewhat predetermined rather than fought for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning through loss emerges organically from Mira's specific journey with the screw, avoiding explicit moralizing until earned by experience. The final image of her walking into the breathing city while "reading between lines" resonantly reweights her initial arrival in fog. Minor deduction for "ordinary miracles" feeling slightly rehearsed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature focused on tactile/mechanical details. Some elevated diction ("occluded views," "anomaly") fits the meditative tone but occasionally drifts toward writerly rather than embodied. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though several instances of abstract phrasing ("emotional terrain," "trembling calm") and mild repetition of conceptual language reduce immediacy. The "reading between lines" motif works but appears five times. Information density is good but some sentences reach for poetry over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of an aromatherapist finding purpose through touch after losing smell offers a fresh angle, particularly the specific detail of the birthing screw hidden in a water clock. Execution is competent but plays somewhat safe with its metaphorical connections. The ending, while resonant, follows a predictable arc of loss-to-acceptance.</comment>
