I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered sensory metaphors and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's loss of smell creates genuine internal contradiction—she reads emotional terrain through touch while mourning molecular absence. Her micro-choice to rotate the screw "one quarter turn" reveals specific values through action. The final walk into the city shows earned acceptance of loss as a new form of reading, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("maps of emotional terrain").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira accepts her loss transforms rather than diminishes her ability to midwife stories. The water clock's "wet newborn gasp" makes cost tangible. However, the revelation about the screw's origin feels slightly convenient, and some connective tissue between discovering the screw and understanding its full story could be stronger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The water clock and birthing screw constrain choices effectively—Mira must read through touch alone. Sensory hierarchy reflects her condition perfectly: "letting absence itself become aroma." The shop-as-diaphragm and fog-as-breath create lived-in atmosphere, though some metaphors strain ("workshop into a diaphragm contracting").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Mira can find meaning without her defining sense. The screw's warmth and micro-scratches create escalating discovery, with cost visible when "tears blurred the loupe." However, external pressure remains gentle—Horace's absence doesn't heighten tension significantly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete—"reading between lines" manifests in metal grooves, emotional terrain, and loss-as-landmark. The ending reweights everything: ordinary miracles exist in absence as much as presence. The midwife's prayer-screw becomes a perfect objective correlative without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains poetic compression throughout: "woman who once bottled dawn itself." Perceptual signature is distinct—everything filtered through touch and mechanical metaphor. Some moments edge toward purple ("spindle around which spun every unseen wonder"), but rhythm control under emotional pressure remains strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density high—most sentences carry multiple functions. However, several metaphors strain logic ("fog pressed against windows, turning the workshop into a diaphragm") and some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("humanize every future client whose pain she could not smell but could midwife into story"). Strong opening/closing lines partially compensate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of water clock mechanics with birth/breath metaphors feels fresh. Using absence of smell as a path to deeper perception transforms the expected loss narrative. Some elements feel workshopped (the birthing screw's convenient discovery), but the synthesis of timepiece and midwifery creates genuine originality.</comment>
