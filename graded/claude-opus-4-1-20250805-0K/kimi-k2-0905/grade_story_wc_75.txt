<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation to preserve dying arts drives consistent choices through bread-baking rituals and the lute transformation, with internal conflict between preservation and abandonment earning the final stance. The "rosewater dread" functions as embodied emotion rather than label, and her choice to resist the Council carries visible cost in risk and vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the waterfall/grotto imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where art becomes "placement—of memory into muscle." The cost lands visibly as artisans risk return and Aurelia stakes her museum's future, though the Council's retreat slightly softens the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall functions as active constraint—limestone acoustics enable the lute-lens resonator, travertine bridges control movement, and honey-slicked floors impede guards. The setting consistently pressures choices and provides tactical resources that shape the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual disappearances to systemic art suppression, with Aurelia's lute transformation forcing artisans to choose between safety and heritage. The Council's arrival creates genuine pressure though their "bewildered" retreat rather than confrontation slightly reduces the cost's sharpness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—bread shaped like initials, the emerald lens becoming resonator, honey as "sticky promise"—building to "art is not displacement, it is placement." The final image of perspective as choice between fracture and fusion offers resonant answer without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Aurelia's cultured perspective with selective perception ("emerald refractions," "limestone arteries"). Some passages drift toward expository ("Aurelia understood now that rescue was not extraction but resonance") but perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with images doing multiple jobs ("Steam rose from the oven, mingling with the perpetual mist") though some abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("The displaced persons had not vanished; they had merely gone silent"). Information density is high but occasional conceptual summaries reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of museum curation with artisan resistance through sensory preservation (bread scent, lute resonance) offers fresh angle on cultural memory. The emerald lens transforming from observation tool to acoustic resonator shows inventive specificity beyond template rebellion narrative.</comment>
