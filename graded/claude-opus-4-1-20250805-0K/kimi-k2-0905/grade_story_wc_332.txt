<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation to capture the runaway dream and restore voices creates clear internal stakes, with embodied moments like "hollowed by absence" and the physical transformation when the cipher enters her skin. The final choice to continue photographing tomorrow's edge shows earned endurance with visible cost ("palette mended with dawn's own gold").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the library transforms, voices return, and Mireya's role evolves with clear cost (the palette cracking, color rushing through her veins). The cipher's resolution creates a before/after through the archipelago's restored voices and the dream becoming a lending object.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago functions as active setting—coral shelves that "hummed whenever someone missed something," movable horizons, and sand ridges "shaped like an open book" all constrain or enable action. The library's transformation at closure ("coral shelves, which now pulsed with coherent longing") shows environment charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest (capturing her runaway dream) to communal restoration (voices of the erased), with clear tightening when the dream appears as "a folded paper boat burning cold fire." The cost is visceral—"Light imploded into the lens, the palette cracked"—though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cipher of longing, the interplay of absence/presence, and the transformation of loss into "luminous absence now brimming." The dream-as-lending-object creates a non-literal answer to longing without stating a moral, and the final image of photographing "tomorrow's edge" resonates thematically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("shelved silence instead of books") and consistent lyric register that matches the fantastical setting. Perceptual signature strong throughout—"the hush of improbable beginnings," "tides rehearse new syllables"—with rhythmic control that heightens without obscuring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("coral shelves that hummed whenever someone missed something"), though occasional purple moments ("cathedral of salt") edge toward overwriting. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of shelving silence and painting with light to capture a cipher of longing offers genuine freshness, with risk-taking in the lyric-fantastical mode paying off through coherent world-building. The transformation of a runaway dream into a library lending object shows inventive synthesis (+0.3 for risk distinction).</comment>
