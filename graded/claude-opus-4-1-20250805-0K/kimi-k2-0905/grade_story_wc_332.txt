<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is concrete and embodied through the watercolor palette and photography, with clear internal stakes around restoring erased voices. The final choice to keep photographing "tomorrow's edge" shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "hollowed by absence" that lacks specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught magical realism paying off in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library shelves pulse with recovered voices. The closure lands with felt cost as Mireya becomes "the gap between heartbeats where forgotten names echo." Orientation anchors (librarian, archipelago, twilight library) establish by ~50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago functions as more than setting—its movable horizon, tide tongues, and coral shelves actively constrain Mireya's quest. The sand ridge "shaped like an open book" and the causeway releasing hushed pulses create a lived-in magical geography. Setting directly enables the final transformation when the archipelago transfers the image into the library shelves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mireya's active pursuit: crossing the causeway, painting light corridors, stepping into tide, finally capturing the dream boat. The dominant stake (recovering erased voices) tightens as she risks "trading a memory you could not name." Cost is visible when "every color she had ever released rushed back through her veins."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "luminous absence"—things lost that still shape us. The cipher of longing isn't stated but enacted through Mireya's quest, culminating in patrons checking out the dream to "remember something vital they had never lived." The final image of photographing "tomorrow's edge" offers a non-literal answer about preserving what slips away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled metaphorical density ("shelved silence instead of books," "tide tongues licked basalt runes"). POV remains stable with Mireya throughout. The perceptual signature—seeing dreams as paper boats, light as paintable substance—is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly serves the magical realist mode, though occasionally dense ("hinge between night and day when clocks forget their purpose"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in peak beats ("airy saturation") that doesn't fully match established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of librarian-as-light-painter pursuing runaway dreams feels fresh and inevitable. The specific angle—shelving silence, painting with light to decode longing—transforms familiar magical realism tropes. Risk-taking in the lyric density and conceptual premise heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
