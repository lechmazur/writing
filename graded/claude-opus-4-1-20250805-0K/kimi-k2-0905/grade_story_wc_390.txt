I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Mireya's actions to save the Echo directly cause the marina's ice to destabilize, forcing her to find a third path.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's "logically emotional" nature manifests concretely through her calculated yet intuitive response to the crisis, particularly in her decision to teach shadows to listen rather than choosing binary salvation/surrender. Her internal conflict between saving the artifact versus the town creates genuine tension. The shadows' transformation into luminous townsfolk provides earned closure, though some emotional beats feel slightly abstracted ("tears that tasted of salt, iron, and whale song").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: the Echo's cracking releases micro-shrieks → nightmares solidify → Mireya must match glacier memory → her solution causes ice to calve → she finds third path of teaching shadows to listen. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost (the worn key, Mireya's tears, permanent duty). Opening anchors who/where/when effectively within first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both setting and active participant - ice "knocked together, producing a low, mournful chord" that Mireya must match vibrationally. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("azure-coat... flapped against her thighs like a flag of truce"). The environment directly constrains choices when "ice beneath her feet began to calve, slabs tilting like altars," forcing the third-path solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: artifact preservation versus town survival, complicated by the ice calving that threatens both. Mireya's agency drives the resolution through her choice to "weave a third path" using vibrational matching. The cost is visible in the worn key teeth and her commitment to "remain the engineer of vibrations," though the shadow transformation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "sonic absolution" and listening as healing, with the shadows transforming from consumers to choir members. The whale motif (bone, baleen bow, mother's call) creates resonance without heavy-handedness. Final image of stars arranging into the Echo's spiral effectively reweights earlier material, though "logically emotional" occasionally feels like prompted vocabulary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sunset bled across the horizon like a wound healing in reverse"). POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation feels unmotivated for an engineer's perspective ("fleshly ethereal," "sonic absolution"), and occasional therapy-speak intrudes ("forgiven longing").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, some metaphors strain ("wound healing in reverse"), and there's occasional overwriting in emotional beats. The prose maintains momentum despite dense figurative language, though "logically emotional" appears three times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper role with sonic/vibrational magic system. The concept of teaching darkness to listen rather than defeating it offers genuine originality. The integration of whale imagery with ice memory and sound creates an organic world-logic, though some elements feel workshopped rather than lived-in.</comment>
