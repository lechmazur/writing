<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's "logically emotional" nature manifests brilliantly through her synesthetic translation of ice-memory into healing frequencies, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (saving artifact vs. preserving marina). The final choice to teach shadows to listen instead of consume shows earned agency with visible cost—her tears of "salt, iron, and whale song."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Mireya transforms destruction into listening, achieving sonic absolution through vibrational matching. The cost is legible in worn key teeth and the engineer's permanent adaptation to "glacier time." Minor orientation delay (who/where/when crystallizes slowly) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both setting and instrument—its "organ pipe" resonance enables the vibrational healing while ice-calving threatens destruction. Sensory layering (azure coat flapping, ice's "mournful chord," shadows' "wet, eager movements") creates lived-in specificity that constrains Mireya's choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Central stake (protecting the Echo to prevent nightmares materializing) escalates through ice calving and shadow advancement, forcing the third-path solution. The "logically emotional calculus" creates genuine pressure, though the resolution's ease (shadows simply dissolve after listening) slightly undercuts the established threat level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "vibrational matching"—teaching darkness to listen rather than destroying it. The final spiral of stars mirroring the Echo's pattern offers a non-literal answer about mercy and adaptation without moralizing, reweighting the entire lighthouse-as-lullaby transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Mireya processes reality through frequencies and resonances ("teeth filed into frequencies rather than ridges"). Voice maintains consistency even under peak stress, with purposeful compression during the climactic vibrational matching sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative coherence ("sunset bled across the horizon like a wound healing in reverse") with high information density. Some ornamental phrases slow momentum ("fleshly ethereal" appears decoratively), and occasional register elevation doesn't fully match POV lexicon during technical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering with whale-bone resonance and shadow-listening creates a fresh angle on protection narratives. The "crypt keeper's key as bow" transformation and ice-as-ancient-memory concept show genuine ingenuity, though some elements (sacred artifact, nightmares materializing) draw from familiar templates.</comment>
