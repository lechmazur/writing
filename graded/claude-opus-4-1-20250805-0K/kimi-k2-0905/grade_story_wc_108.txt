<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's phobia-driven contradictions (flinching at shadows yet leaping off buildings) create authentic tension, and his final choice to leak vulnerable footage carries visible career cost. The child character feels more symbolic than pressurized, but Leo's micro-choices under fear—placing the shell on the projector while guards approach—reveal values through embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Leo walking toward the studio ready to leak his vulnerable footage, crystallizing his stance that "vulnerability is the power source." The DNA revelation drives causal linkage through inheritance-seeking to self-acceptance, though the child's appearance strains believability. Cost is visible in career risk and the "trembling certainty" of his final walk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rusted library's iron shelves and drainage alcoves constrain Leo's search path, while the perforated roof becomes instrumental for projecting footage to distract guards. Sensory selection reflects Leo's stunt-double perception ("counting heartbeats like stunt beats"). The setting could more actively pressure choices beyond providing escape routes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from identity crisis (DNA revelation) through inheritance quest (finding the shell) to career transformation (choosing to leak vulnerable footage). The guards' arrival forces Leo's decisive projection gambit, and his choice to walk "toward the studio backlot" with trembling certainty shows agency foreclosing his old masked identity with clear professional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Leo's transformation from hiding fear behind stunts to embracing vulnerability as "the live wire." The shell's whisper—"keep the trembling take"—reweights his entire career philosophy without moralizing. The final image of walking with "trembling certainty toward lights that would never again drown the shake" offers resonant answer to whether weakness can be strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive stunt-double perception ("reel," "take," "frame," "places") with controlled metaphorical density. Perceptual signature shows in how Leo reads the world through film terminology and physical fear responses. Some elevated diction ("palimpsest," "obsolete film cans moldered") occasionally drifts from Leo's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the tyrant's legitimate heirs would announce that the family brand—my bruised body double brand—was being retired"). Some metaphorical excess appears ("stars spilled through the holes like unpaid extras") and occasional register elevation, but momentum sustains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a phobia-ridden stunt double discovering he's the son of his tyrannical director offers fresh paradox. The transformation from physical courage/emotional cowardice to embracing vulnerable footage as power inverts expectations. The child with the cast feels slightly convenient, but the overall synthesis of fear, performance, and authenticity feels earned.</comment>
