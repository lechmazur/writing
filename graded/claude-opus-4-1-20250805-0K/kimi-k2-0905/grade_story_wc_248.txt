I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered revelations about fire, preservation, and family legacy, with pattern recognition and symbolic accumulation driving toward a conceptual repricing at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ember's motivation coheres around the grandmother's legacy, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive mind") rather than embodied emotion. The final transformation from destroyer to preserver occurs through exposition rather than dramatized struggle, though the cost of burning false repositories provides some weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing where destruction becomes preservation, with moderate conceptual cost in the collapsed archive. However, the revelation about false libraries arrives as exposition without prior groundwork, and the pattern of "artistic creations" leading to discovery feels mechanically convenient rather than causally earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The underground archive setting provides atmosphere but doesn't constrain choices meaningfully - Ember simply walks through and retrieves the tapestry without environmental obstacles. Sensory detail remains generic ("soot-stained walls," "old parchment") without POV-specific filtering that would reveal character through perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - rescuing grandmother's promise - remains static throughout without meaningful tightening. No opposing force challenges Ember's descent; the archive "collapses behind her" conveniently after she succeeds, creating false tension without actual cost to her goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of destruction-as-preservation emerges clearly through the final revelation, reweighting Ember's arson retroactively. However, the insight arrives through direct exposition ("her arson had never been about destruction but about revelation") rather than earned realization, and the "volcanic tenderness" motif feels forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains basic stability but lacks distinct perceptual signature - Ember notices things generically rather than through an arsonist's specific lens. Repetitive phrasing ("volcanic tenderness" appears 4 times, "analytically intuitive" 3 times) creates template cadence without rhythmic purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues: "volcanic tenderness" (4x), "analytically intuitive mind" (3x), "artistic creations/trail" (8x), "forgotten promise" (4x) create loops without pattern-teaching payoff. Abstract declarations ("the fire remembers") replace concrete imagery, and overlong sentences blur momentum in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of an arsonist preserving truth through destruction offers moderate freshness, but execution relies on convenient plotting (self-decoding messages, perfectly timed archive collapse). The grandmother-archivist backstory follows familiar mentor-legacy patterns without distinctive inflection.</comment>
