<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's grief manifests through embodied contradictions—the prism warming against lies, his need crystallizing through renunciation. The "truthful lies" mechanism creates genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("aggregate sorrow") but the final choice to leave the prism carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as frost patterns, light refractions, and crystalline resonances build toward Elian's acceptance. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he leaves the prism, accepting separation while acknowledging continuing need—cost visible in the "fracture inside him." Deduction for slightly abstract middle sections and "academic heresy" backstory that doesn't alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost-etched car window constrain Elian's communion method—he must press the prism to specific surfaces to access memory. Environment actively shapes the ritual through crystalline resonance and temperature shifts. The car-as-reliquary concept grounds the abstract in concrete detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elian's progression from first lie ("I have let you go") through admission ("I need you still") to final acceptance ("Keep the colors; I'll keep the hush"). Each truthful lie tightens his options for maintaining connection. The cost manifests in the prism's fracture mirroring his internal break—though some middle passages lack immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete mechanism of objects absorbing and releasing emotion, avoiding abstract moralizing. The "truthful lies" paradox creates genuine complexity about grief's necessity. Final image of initials melting to water offers non-literal answer about impermanence without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains mystical register with controlled diction ("shifted hush," "mineral breath") that supports the communion ritual. Some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("aggregate sorrow baked into vinyl") that strain POV credibility. Clean focalization throughout with purposeful compression in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density varies—strong passages like "frost briefly wrote her initials before melting" contrast with abstract loops ("truthful lies...were the only currency"). Template cadence appears in middle sections ("He whispered...He scraped...He knelt"). The "academic heresy" line and "aggregate sorrow" phrases edge toward register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of communing through object-absorbed emotions offers fresh angle on grief narrative. "Truthful lies" mechanism and car-as-reliquary avoid stock memorial tropes. Some middle passages rely on familiar mystical imagery (crystal trees, light through prisms) without full transformation.</comment>
