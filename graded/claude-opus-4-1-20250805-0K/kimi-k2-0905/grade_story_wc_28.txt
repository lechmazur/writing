I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered memories, mosaic imagery, and symbolic transformation rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Asha's transformation from "gentle radical" to "Iron Cradle" is earned through specific witnessed trauma (mother burning book for warmth), with contradictory impulses acting in scene as she simultaneously preserves and releases memories. The final choice to create "maps of forgetting" reconciles her idealism with pragmatic mercy, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("empathy's armor") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Asha's creation of the forgetting map and subsequent departure, with visible cost in her abandonment of absolutist ideals about knowledge preservation. The accumulative structure coheres as tessera-gathering builds to artistic transformation, though the three-month retrocognitive setup could anchor more concretely in the opening beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The minaret's damaged mosaics and plaza's fractured stepping stone actively constrain Asha's work (collecting exactly 49 pieces, reading by touch), while the "shattered sky" and fire-transformed constellation create atmospheric pressure that charges the final image. The mosaic's transformation from "Merciful Judge" to "outstretched arms" through heat damage exemplifies how setting shapes meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through Asha's methodical tessera collection building to the dawn revelation that she's constructing "empathy's armor," with the dominant stake (how to honor both memory and forgetting) crystallizing in her final artistic choice. The cost manifests in her self-exile and the abandoned "self-righteous speeches," though the middle section could tighten the connection between vision and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central theme—that mercy lies in selective forgetting rather than universal remembrance—emerges organically through the mother's book-burning choice and Asha's mosaic transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of citizens adding their own fragments creates a living document of "wounded healing" that resists tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception focused on tactile details ("feeling for telltale edges") and architectural fragments, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("empathy's armor," "wounded healing") that slightly distances from Asha's embodied experience. The controlled rhythm effectively modulates between memory immersion and present-moment action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the 49 pieces both mark time and become art), though several abstract formations ("aberrant mercy had taken root in her chest," "constructing empathy's armor") could ground more concretely. Some template phrasing appears ("She had spent," "She'd watched," "She was constructing") but doesn't pervade enough to seriously impede momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of "maps of forgetting" as counterpoint to archival preservation offers genuine freshness, while the transformation of astronomical charts into personal cartography of trauma provides non-obvious synthesis. The specific detail of 49 tesserae matching 49 days and the mother's book-burning dilemma ground universal themes in particular moments.</comment>
