<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Asha's transformation from idealistic radical to the Iron Cradle who builds "maps of forgetting" demonstrates genuine character evolution with contradictory impulses—her past certainty about universal knowledge access wars with her witnessed mercy of forgetting. The final choice to teach others these maps carries visible cost (exile, solitude) though some interior passages lean toward abstract reflection rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Asha's creation of the mosaic that transforms from the Merciful Judge constellation into a figure with infinite arms, crystallizing her new understanding with visible cost (leaving the city, years of wandering). The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and tesserae accumulate toward this charged final image, though the who/where/when anchoring takes until ~150 words to fully clarify.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined plaza with its damaged mosaics and tesserae constrains Asha's work—she must read history through touch, collect exactly 49 pieces, work by starlight—making the setting essential to her transformation. The shattered sky, minaret, and geometric patterns create a vivid post-catastrophe world, though some descriptive passages could integrate more tightly with action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether knowledge should be preserved or forgotten—escalates from Asha's retrocognitive visions through her solitary cataloguing to the creation of her transformative mosaic, with visible cost in her exile and the city's wounded healing. The tension between remembering and forgetting deepens through accumulated images rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens, though the middle section could tighten its pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The final image of citizens adding their own fragments to Asha's pattern offers a resonant answer to the central question about mercy in choosing what to remember—the community's "living document" embraces both burden and blessing without moralizing. The theme emerges through concrete particulars (burning books for warmth, the transformed constellation) rather than abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mythic-literary register with controlled distance that suits the story's scope, using phrases like "the plaza beneath the shattered sky held its breath" and "empathy's armor" to create atmosphere. Some passages slip into expository interiority ("She'd watched...had seen...") that could be more immediate, but the voice coheres around its elevated tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong imagery like "reading history in shattered glass," though several passages contain paraphrase loops ("teaching others to read the maps of forgetting"/"citizens brought their own fragments...adding them to the growing constellation"). Information density is good but some transitions between past visions and present action could be smoother.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of "maps of forgetting" as a form of mercy offers a fresh angle on post-catastrophe narratives, transforming the typical preservation-versus-destruction binary into something more nuanced. The specific detail of collecting exactly 49 tesserae for the 49 days of fire shows purposeful world-building, though the setup follows somewhat familiar post-apocalyptic archive patterns.</comment>
