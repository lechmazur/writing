<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grandmother's contradictory impulses—reverence for tradition versus necessity for evolution—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her fusion of "plant-whispers and glyph-meanings" into new ritual. Her final choice to disperse rather than possess the embryo's power demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost ("joints creaking like old timber"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around destiny and tradition that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught motifs (steam, memory, seeds) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the embryo dissolves into collective potential rather than individual power. The cost is legible in her physical exhaustion and the seventeen moons of labor, with the final image of children finding unnamed seedlings crystallizing the transformation. Slight opacity around the kite's role as inciting element.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The volcanic springs and steam function as active constraints, enabling the ritual while marking sacred space ("soil here, near the sulfurous vents, remembered everything"). The vines physically steady her during transformation, making environment integral to the climactic unsealing. World-building through specific details (temples as ration depots, sacred root-harvest) creates lived-in texture, though some abstract passages about memory and tradition lack sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal resistance to collective transformation as the grandmother moves from decoding glyphs to actively unsealing the embryo, with each step narrowing her options (refuse/comply/transform). The cost manifests physically in her gnarled fingers and creaking joints, and spiritually in choosing dispersal over power. The tightening from individual to collective destiny lands with felt weight, though middle development could show more concrete obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and evolution, with the embryo's transformation from singular destiny to "seeded into many" offering a non-literal answer to how tradition survives oppression. The recurring script motif—from kite to glyphs to seedling shapes—accumulates meaning without explicit moralizing. The final image of children finding questions rather than answers perfectly encapsulates the theme of evolution as "rebellion's deepest form."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves mythic register with concrete detail ("steam curling around her knuckles," "moss against skin"), maintaining consistent perceptual signature focused on texture and connection. The prose modulates effectively between lyric meditation and grounded action, with purposeful compression in reflective passages. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping, though occasionally elevated diction ("embryo in amber," "implanted destiny") slightly exceeds the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the vines that both restrain and steady, steam as breath and witness). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure support the accumulative design. Deductions for occasional abstract passages ("destiny unchosen is no destiny at all") and some elevated register drift in peak moments, though the prose remains largely propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological resistance with ancestral memory through plant telepathy offers a fresh angle on rebellion narrative. The specific transformation of destiny from genetic predetermination to collective possibility subverts expected chosen-one tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet, dispersive ending rather than dramatic confrontation heightens thematic stakes (+0.3), with the image of cryptic script growing in seedlings providing memorable specificity.</comment>
