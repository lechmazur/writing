<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from "gentle erasure" to memory preservation is well-motivated through accumulated encounters with photographs, each triggering concrete micro-choices (cataloging→murmuring narratives→public display). His internal contradiction between duty and growing reverence plays out through embodied actions, though some interiority relies on summary ("realized his task wasn't to erase memory"). The final stance crystallization ("humanity remembers") carries visible professional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's role transforms from warden to archivist with clear institutional cost. The photographs-to-shrine progression builds causally, each discovery deepening his engagement. Minor orientation wobble ("midnight ridgeway at twilight") and the supervisor confrontation feels slightly rushed, but the ending image of ongoing archival work reweights the opening's surveillance mandate effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drowned town's emergence creates atmospheric pressure, with specific details (rooftops like knuckles, waterlogged hymnals) grounding the surreal premise. The ridgeway functions as liminal space between past/present, constraining Elias's choices. Some descriptions lean generic ("humid air," "indigo into charcoal"), but objects actively shape action—the sapphire label leads him to the gazebo, photographs determine his path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from documenting relics to preserving collective memory, with Elias's professional mandate creating genuine tension. The supervisor confrontation crystallizes the conflict between institutional erasure and human remembrance. Cost is visible (permanent reassignment) though the resolution feels slightly convenient—the state's acquiescence to his defiance could use more friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through accumulating images of persistence—the widower's nightly toasts, Mrs. Lorne's Sunday rolls "even after flood warnings." The transformation from "expunge" to "monument" reweights memory's value without explicit moralizing. The final line about the silent wind chime creates resonant closure, suggesting acceptance has replaced the need for warning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with purposeful compression ("drowned fifty years ago beneath the Silvervein Dam, a sacrifice to progress"). Some passages drift toward elevated register not fully grounded in Elias's perspective ("threads of story that bound strangers to ghosts"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the supervisor exchange effectively contrasts bureaucratic and humanistic registers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("rooftops breached the waterline like the knuckles of a drowning man") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("He began to spin...," "He set up...," "He'd spun them..."). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum (memory/remembrance concepts reiterated). The "midnight ridgeway at twilight" creates temporal confusion that disrupts clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of a levee warden becoming memory's guardian offers fresh angle on disaster aftermath, avoiding typical rescue/tragedy narratives. The photographs as "echoes, imprinted by grief" presents original mechanism for exploring collective memory. Execution stays somewhat safe, not fully exploiting the surreal potential of the resurfacing town or pushing deeper into the ethical complexity of erasure.</comment>
