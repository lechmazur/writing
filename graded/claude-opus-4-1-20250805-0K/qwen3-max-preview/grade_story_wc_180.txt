<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's motivation to reconnect with her daughter drives every choice, with contradictory impulses (pride in craft vs. shame at rejection) acting simultaneously in scene. The daughter's complexity emerges through the discovered vow and green fabric—genuinely flawed without safety-hedging. The final choice to persist despite no reconciliation shows earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the green fabric crystallizes that the daughter returned but won't reconcile yet, reweighting the blue ribbon's meaning with undeniable emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds as vow-gathering builds to this discovery. Who/where/when anchored early through cathedral setting and Guild backstory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid constrains choices brilliantly—vows literally grow on trees, forcing physical climbing to retrieve them. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ground to rafters. The setting's magical logic (deciduous vows as visible objects) shapes every tactical decision and charges the final image of tangled roses at the threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom) escalates through discovered vow to footprints to green fabric, each narrowing the mender's options. The vow's resistance and honey-coaxing sequence provides concrete obstacle. Cost is visible in the daughter's absence despite return—relationship permanently altered even if hope remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of mending as distinct from redemption—"wisdom grows best when tended across generations." The ribbon-to-vow stitching literalizes connection attempts. "Accidental wisdom" pays off through the daughter's unintended gift. The ending reweights all prior collecting as preparation for uncertain return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through the mender's occupational lens ("quartz-eye," seeing vows as repairable objects). Voice modulates effectively from wry humor ("endearingly feisty") to raw vulnerability. Free indirect style clean throughout. Slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("wisdom, like orchards") fits the lyrical mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("ladder woven from ivy and old hymnals"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("captured sky," "shy confession") and occasional template phrasing ("She sighed, then grinned"). Information density high—most lines advance multiple story functions. Final image of climbing with "honey, thread, and hope" resonates without forcing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The deciduous vows concept transforms a parent-child story through genuinely fresh worldbuilding where promises become harvestable fruit. Risk-taking in the magical realist register heightens stakes—the daughter's vow hanging like "overripe persimmon" is both specific and emotionally precise. The honey-and-spoon solution feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
