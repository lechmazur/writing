<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's internal contradiction between preservation and awakening drives genuine change, with the prophecy creating layered temporal complexity. The embodied response to memory (trembling fingers, velvet disquiet in bones) avoids diagnostic language. Minor deduction for some filter-verb clustering and the slightly convenient alignment of child-prophecy with present reality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through the "velvet disquiet" transformation spreading via petals. The prophecy creates meaningful tightening that shifts purpose from archiving to awakening. Cost is visible in the city's emotional sterility being quietly disrupted. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the emotional ecosystem concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard functions as active setting that constrains and enables—trees respond to memory frequencies, petals become vessels for emotional transmission. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss-wet stone, copper thread, neon buzz). The vertical geography (spire/street) reinforces thematic separation. Exceptional integration of setting as both archive and agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving vs. awakening emotion) tightens when the prophecy shifts Elira's purpose. Agency manifests through her choice to release petals despite the "soft, pervasive" nature of change. The foghorn's silence creates urgency. Deduction for the relatively low immediate cost—the transformation is gentle rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of archived emotions becoming "spores of empathy." The child-voice prophecy creates dramatic irony that reweights the entire orchard project. The final image of continued archiving/speaking offers a non-literal answer about memory's role in urban renewal without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through specialized knowledge (dead languages, emotional pattern recognition). Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to childhood memory to mystical communion. Some filter-verb clustering ("She understood," "She realized") slightly dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the plum trees both mark time and store emotion). Some paraphrase loops around the emotional archive concept and repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Strong opening and closing lines. Deduction for filter-verb stacks and some abstract phrasing around "emotional ecosystems."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratic archiving with mystical communion is genuinely fresh. The accidental prophecy spoken unknowingly by the younger self creates compelling temporal paradox. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure and the "velvet disquiet" transformation method heightens meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
