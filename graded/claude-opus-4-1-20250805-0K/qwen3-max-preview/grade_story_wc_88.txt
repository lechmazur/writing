<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seeker's hollow state following memory excision creates a compelling internal contradiction—emptiness seeking to kindle empathy. Their motivation is clear and drives the central choice to release the baseball, accepting connection to pain they once caused. The final choice to carry the labyrinth's map "as resonance" shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the seeker releases the baseball and accepts the weight of unmade choices, with cost visible in "raw, aching proximity to pain." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered imagery (lake, ripples, submerged objects) toward the final reweighting. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph 2 with character state and underground setting established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake constrains the central choice—its memory-holding properties enable the seeker's transformation. Setting details like "colonies of engineered algae" and "Layer 7" create a lived-in underground world. The lake's responsiveness to the baseball with "branching fractals" directly shapes the emotional revelation and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking the lake to confronting unmade choices when ripples reveal "each wavelet a path not taken." The seeker's agency drives the release of the baseball with clear cost: accepting "raw, aching proximity to pain." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as images compound toward the kindling of empathy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of the floating baseball and branching ripples representing unchosen paths. The final resonance—carrying the labyrinth "not as memory, but as resonance"—offers a non-literal answer to rebuilding empathy after erasure. Subtext operates through Kael's scars "like subway routes" and the time traveler's ambiguous dating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent noir-tinged lyricism with distinctive phrases like "hollow as guilt" and "delicately robust." POV control holds steady with selective perception filtering the underground world. Dialogue between seeker and Kael carries subtext about reading "silence between" lines, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"the water glowing faintly turquoise like forgotten neon" establishes setting while evoking loss. Some metaphor density in peak moments ("ghostly relief against the cavern's ribs") occasionally tips toward overwriting. Information flows cleanly with strong propulsion through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of memory excision creating a "clean slate" with residual staining offers fresh ground. Specific details like decoding weather reports for coordinates and the time-traveling baseball signature avoid generic templates. The synthesis of noir investigation with psychological rebirth through an underground bioluminescent lake shows genuine originality.</comment>
