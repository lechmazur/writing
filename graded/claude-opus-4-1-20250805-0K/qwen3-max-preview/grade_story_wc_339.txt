<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's relationship with death as "a first-name basis acquaintance" creates a distinctive emotional stance that earns the final wave through accumulated specificity. The protagonist's analytical detachment ("dissected grief like equations") credibly transforms into connection through embodied details like the globe warming when admitting missing their sister. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("letting go isn't a variable. It's a verb") that briefly undercuts embodiment in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist releases the snow globe and waves to death, completing an earned transformation from analytical detachment to acceptance with visible cost (the globe "unmade"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through the snow globe's impossible physics accumulating meaning until the final release. Who/where/when anchored adequately by "library sank with the ship" and "after locating Amelia Earhart's plane."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The snow globe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (its temperature drops when whispering Amelia's name, grows warm when admitting grief) and charges the final image when it dissolves. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mahogany shelves warped by salt and silence," "miniature blizzards even under six miles of crushing dark"). The sunken library and Earhart's plane provide atmospheric pressure without overwhelming the intimate scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding "the physics of letting go"—evolves from intellectual pursuit to embodied surrender, with the snow globe's properties forcing increasingly personal admissions. The protagonist's seventy-three nights of obsessive study create meaningful pressure that narrows options to final release. Cost is legible when the globe vanishes ("Unmade") and the protagonist stands "hollow and humming."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the snow globe's paradoxical physics mirroring emotional release: "letting go isn't collapse. It's recalibration. It's mass converting to light." The final image of waving to death after releasing the globe offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom through specific experience rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through scientific observation filtered through grief ("noted anomalies without flinching, dissected grief like equations"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical distance to intimate admission, though Amelia's imagined dialogue briefly risks ventriloquism. The prose maintains controlled lyricism that serves the sophisticated melancholy without overwhelming clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("ocean currents whispered like librarians shushing the deep"). Some figurative density in emotional beats approaches overwriting ("hollow and humming, the wind now warm") but doesn't obscure closure. Minor template cadence in the "It's mass converting to light. It's love persisting as pattern" sequence. Strong propulsion through varied syntax despite occasional elevated diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of Amelia Earhart's disappearance with personal grief through quantum physics creates an original angle on loss. The snow globe as "receiver for emotional resonance" transforms a potential cliché into fresh territory. The specific detail of "0.3°C whenever I whispered Amelia's name" grounds the fantastic in precise observation. Risk-taking in the metaphysical premise heightens rather than obscures the emotional stakes.</comment>
