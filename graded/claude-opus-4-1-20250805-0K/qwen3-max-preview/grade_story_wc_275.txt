<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's renunciation of violence is embodied through the ritual sheathing of the knife and her cultivation methods, with internal consistency maintained throughout. The transformation from bounty hunter's daughter to peaceful cultivator shows clear motivation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "cultivating quiet" and values teaching that borders on telling rather than showing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with the rose farm as persistent constraint and the final seed-giving as Resonant Reconfiguration showing continuity's cost against the ruined world. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherent pressure through vignettes. Deduction for slightly soft cost articulation - while the "weight of choosing gentleness" is stated, the specific price Elara pays remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass dome environment constrains choices effectively (tea from rose hips, arrangements from limited blooms) and the sandbag scrap functions as micro-setting that charges memory. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (liquid gold light, red soil, grit clinging). Modest deduction for some generic post-apocalyptic markers that don't fully distinguish this particular ruined world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving beauty/continuity against brutality is signaled early and tested through visitor encounters. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment - visitors arrive and accept seeds without meaningful resistance or cost to Elara's mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cultivation metaphor and specific acts (cutting stems for orphanages, teaching plants patience). The final image of the girl with "dirt under her nails and something like peace" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic statement about "continuity" that could have remained more implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with selective perception ("tremor in a petal before wind arrived") and controlled rhythm. POV distance remains stable with no head-hopping. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds what feels natural for the character's background ("inculcated plants with values").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the sandbag holding "more than weight—it held memory, gravity, the hush of descent"). Some beautiful specific imagery throughout. Deduction for occasional overwriting in figurative language ("petals unfurling in slow, silent prayer") and slight redundancy in explaining the knife's transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a bounty hunter's daughter creating a peaceful oasis offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic redemption. Specific details like using airship ballast bags as planters show originality. However, the general arc of violence-to-peace through gardening, while well-executed, follows somewhat familiar territory without fully transformative risk-taking.</comment>
