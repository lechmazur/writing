<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's idealism and nervous confidence manifest through concrete actions—trembling fingers from "electric certainty," not fear—and her motivation builds causally from exile through discovery to power. The copper nail functions as both talisman and proof, grounding her great-grandfather's erased heroism in a physical object that burns at the climax. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("nervously confident" restated rather than continuously embodied) and occasional therapy-speak ("pilgrimage into power").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elara transforms exile into power through completing her grandfather's work, with visible cost in the burning nail and conceptual cost in choosing memory over pardon. The stanza discovery → machine activation → storm response → jet stream shift provides clear escalation. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (weather station, Isla Vire, Elara sorting journals). The ending reweights exile as pilgrimage with earned authority, though the mechanics of storm control could be more precise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The weather station and storm-altered world create immediate pressure, with sensory details like "flickering emergency lamps" and the copper nail growing "warm against her skin." The resonance board and station's "metal bones" function as setting-tools that enable the climactic storm control. Setting constrains choices through isolation and the shipwrecked journals' physical state. Some missed opportunities for more tactile engagement with the waterlogged materials.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (reversing exile) through familial (honoring grandfather) to global (controlling weather), with the discovery of Journal #7 as the decisive tightening that forces action. The storm's response creates immediate pressure that Elara must navigate through questioning rather than force. Cost is visible in the burning nail and the choice to claim power rather than seek pardons. The resolution feels slightly convenient—the storm yields too easily to her first attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, erasure, and recognition—the drowned sailors, erased grandfather, and exiled Elara all demand to be "remembered, mapped, honored." The copper nail transforms from talisman to key to quiet hum, physically embodying the theme's evolution. The final image of maps "sung by storms" and "forged in nails" offers a resonant non-literal answer to questions of authority and legitimacy. Slight deduction for the explicit "pilgrimage into power" formulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception reflecting Elara's cartographic mindset ("charted not by machines, but by mercy"). Rhythmic control in peak moments like "The sky cracked open—not with lightning, but with light." Some register drift into elevated diction ("golden and slow, as if dawn itself were being rewound") that slightly exceeds the established voice. The perceptual signature of seeing patterns and codes everywhere supports character but occasionally overreaches.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("glaciers wept into steam," "compass needles caught in a ghost's grip") and good rhythmic variation. Multiple instances of template cadence ("It was memory. It was grief. It was the drowned sailors") and some overwriting in figurative density during high-pressure beats. The paraphrase loop around "nervously confident" appears twice with similar phrasing. Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose ("golden and slow, as if dawn itself were being rewound").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather control through maritime poetry codes offers a fresh angle on climate fiction, avoiding typical technological or mystical approaches. The specific detail of the copper nail from a sea-burial casket and the concept of storms as collective memory show genuine invention. The transformation of exile into pilgrimage through ancestral completion provides an emotionally complex resolution. Some derivative elements in the weather-station-as-last-hope setup prevent higher scoring.</comment>
