<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in her belief that "whispers traveled farther than shouts" and her internal conflict between mechanical duty and spiritual purpose creates genuine tension. The cork's vibration against her lips and her physical response ("sank to her knees") embody the cost of her choice. However, the secondary characters (ship captains) lack individuated presence beyond their functional transformation, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's act transforms multiple ships' courses through "vibrations of intent," with visible cost in her exhaustion and relief "thick as honey in her throat." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image of her as broadcaster of tenderness. The closure lands cleanly with "This was her language. This was how the world healed," though the transformation of the ships feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse functions as more than setting—its "bruised sentinel" presence and spiral stairs create spatial pressure for Elara's descent into action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "jasmine, night-blooming cereus, damp earth" directly enables the story's central mechanism. The lighthouse beam pulsing "in time with her heartbeat" charges the final image, though some descriptive passages ("liquid gold," "rose and amber") lean toward the picturesque.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers can guide better than shouts—escalates through Elara's test moving from individual fishermen to "the sea itself." The cost manifests in her physical depletion and the risk of failure with circling ships. However, the resolution lacks a true opposing force; the ships' transformation happens too smoothly without meaningful resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of gentle power versus forceful command emerges organically through the cork's function and the ships' transformation. The final image of Elara as keeper broadcasting "by scent, by silence, by the quietest beckoning" offers a non-literal answer to whether tenderness can navigate chaos. The piece avoids moralizing, though phrases like "This was how the world healed" edge toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "cobalt lighthouse stood like a bruised sentinel" establishes voice immediately. POV remains stable with Elara's interiority filtered through sensory perception. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("screaming tenderness," "liquid gold") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the emotional texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "vibration surged—not sound, but resonance, like a tuning fork struck against bone" demonstrate precise figurative language. However, repetitive structures appear ("She had... She believed... She descended...") and some passages contain ornamental description ("painting the sea in liquid gold") that slows momentum. The phrase "screaming tenderness" feels forced rather than organic to the voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of using scent and vibration to guide ships offers a fresh angle on lighthouse-keeper stories. The specific detail of the cork "carved from heartwood of a tree struck by lightning during a vow of forgiveness" shows imaginative world-building. However, the transformation mechanism feels somewhat convenient, and the resolution lacks the surprise or deeper complexity that would elevate it further.</comment>
