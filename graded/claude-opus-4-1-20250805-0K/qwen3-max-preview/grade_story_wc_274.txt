<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's internal conflict between duty and conscience drives genuine tension, with her final choice earned through consistent characterization. The "bravely conflicted" attribute manifests through embodied details like trembling fingers "not from cold" and her calm acceptance of capture, though some interiority veers toward explanatory rather than experiential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure with the archivist's choice triggering cascading emotional contagion throughout society—a Decisive Change with clear cost (her erasure). The Resonance Table mechanism and dormant networks provide coherent causality, though early orientation could anchor more concretely. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern of emotional transmission effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library setting functions as both physical constraint and thematic mirror, with details like "frost clinging to his mustache" and "triple-ice quarantine" reinforcing the central cold/truth tension. The Resonance Table and dormant networks embedded in architecture cleverly make setting instrumental to plot, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("high arched windows").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal moral conflict to societal transformation through the archivist's agency, with clear cost paid (her erasure and imprisonment). The tension between suppression and revelation drives toward meaningful closure, though the middle could tighten—the lengthy aftermath diminishes immediate pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the contrast of frozen silence versus emotional truth, with the final image of the spectral archivist "waiting for the next bravely conflicted soul" offering resonant non-literal closure. The weaponization of vulnerability and truth-as-contagion metaphor develops organically through action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled formality matching the archival setting ("cryo-wax cracked open with a sigh like breaking ice"). POV maintains appropriate distance with selective interiority, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary in the aftermath sections. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("Because truth doesn't need volume").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure, but several template patterns emerge ("She had...", "She knew...", "She placed..."). Some metaphors strain (truth "nested in limbic systems") and the aftermath section contains repetitive constructions that diminish momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of emotional resonance as revolutionary weapon offers fresh angle on surveillance-state fiction, with specific details like "blood-ink" and "neural echoes stored in marble columns" grounding the premise. The transformation of archives from tombs to kindling provides memorable reconceptualization, though some dystopian elements feel familiar.</comment>
