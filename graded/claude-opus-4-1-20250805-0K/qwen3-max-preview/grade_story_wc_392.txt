I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and memory resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The investigator's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—her inheritance of the lantern and choice to become witness rather than bureaucrat. The internal contradiction between professional detachment ("watchfully calm") and ancestral pull operates throughout, culminating in her tattooing names on her forearm. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "memory-field" and "spectral resonance frequencies" that briefly shifts into diagnostic language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the investigator's transformation from routine investigator to witness-keeper, with visible cost in the tattooed names and acknowledged burden ("not lighter, but steadier"). The accumulative structure coheres as historical echoes layer into present investigation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and the abstract "memory-field rupture" explanation that momentarily breaks the otherwise grounded supernatural logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as active setting—its reverberations, temperature drops, and moisture patterns become investigative data while the inherited lantern constrains and enables discovery. Sensory detail effectively narrows during crisis moments (silver light casting no shadows). The subway's layers of time create genuine spatial pressure that shapes the investigation method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from routine investigation to confronting the city's "refusal to remember," with the investigator choosing witness over career advancement. The pressure accumulates through spectral encounters that force her stance crystallization. The cost manifests in her predicted dismissal and the physical burden of tattooed names, though the middle section could tighten around the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lantern's dual function as investigative tool and ancestral anchor—progress requiring memory rather than amnesia. The final image of the pulsing lantern synchronizing heartbeats resonates without stating its meaning. Subtext operates cleanly through the parallel between Underground Railroad and modern subway, though one instance of near-thematic statement ("progress requires amnesia") slightly weakens the emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal-lyrical register appropriate to the investigator's professional-mystical duality. Perceptual signature strong in how she processes supernatural as data ("measuring echo decay, charting temperature drops"). Some filter-verb clustering in the middle investigation sequence and occasional register elevation ("fabric she refuses to let unravel") that doesn't quite match the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine power ("shadows stretch like reaching fingers") but suffers from periodic abstraction and some repetitive constructions. The phrase "memory-field" and similar compounds feel artificially technical. Several sentences in the middle section loop similar concepts about memory and trauma without advancing pressure. Information density is generally strong but inconsistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of preventable death investigation with ancestral haunting offers a non-obvious angle on both bureaucratic procedural and ghost story. The specific detail of tattooing victims' names alongside historical runaways creates memorable particularity. The concept of investigating supernatural causes through empirical methods shows originality, though some execution choices (memory-field terminology) feel template-derived.</comment>
