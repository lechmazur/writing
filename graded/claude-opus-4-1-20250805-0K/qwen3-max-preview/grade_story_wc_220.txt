<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bracken's motivation to preserve voices rather than bodies drives genuine character transformation with visible cost. His internal shift from death-finder to voice-keeper is earned through concrete discoveries (the cylinders, his handler's message). The wax leaf as both memory object and revelation tool creates layered motivation. Slight deduction for some abstract phrasing around "translate distance into closeness" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught revelation system (colored projections through leaf). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the settlement transforms from salvage to resonance economy, with clear cost (the weight of carrying voices). The handler's voice discovery provides meaningful tightening that narrows Bracken's path. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the "distance into closeness" concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The scrapyard setting constrains choices effectively—cylinders must be excavated, equipment salvaged and hand-cranked. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (shellac scent, groove textures). The wax leaf functions as micro-setting that enables plot through its projection ability. Setting evolution from graveyard to archive is earned through specific transformations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through discovery sequence: single cylinder → handler's voice → bunker of voices → settlement transformation. The dominant stake (preserving lost voices) intensifies with each revelation, forcing higher commitment. Cost is visible in Bracken's role shift and the settlement's complete reorientation. Slight deduction for predictable progression without significant reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the groove-reading metaphor—hidden truths require patient decoding. The leaf's color-coded revelations avoid heavy symbolism while creating meaning. Final image of children learning grooves before words offers resonant answer to preservation theme without moralizing. Strong integration of "resonance over salvage" transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Bracken's sideways-seeing and scent-focused attention. Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm. Some repetitive phrasing ("tinted revelations," "translate distance into closeness") creates minor template feel. POV distance occasionally drifts toward omniscient summary in settlement-wide descriptions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some repetitive structures ("He + verb" patterns) and abstract phrasing ("translate distance into closeness") create minor drag. The "intuively descriptive" phrase appears forced. Otherwise strong sensory specificity and varied paragraph rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-apocalyptic trope through focus on voice preservation over physical survival. The phonograph cylinder decoding method is inventive and specific. Transformation of bloodhound's tracking skills into emotional archaeology shows originality. Some familiar wasteland imagery prevents higher score.</comment>
