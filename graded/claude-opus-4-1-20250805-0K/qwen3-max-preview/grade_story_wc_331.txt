<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian's "sanely eccentric" nature manifests through concrete choices (alphabetizing by emotional resonance, shelving grief between calculus) that drive her quest. Her final act of reawakening stories shows earned agency with visible cost—the scarf's transformation and patrons' altered experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through hyperbolic geometry leading to the amphitheater revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she reawakens stories, with cost visible in the scarf's glow and patrons' changed perception. The orientation anchors (librarian, library, night) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hyperbolic tessellations and story-cores as "glowing orbs" create vivid specificity that constrains her journey. The amphitheater's impossible geometry ("spiraling bookshelves that curved upward into impossible vaults") charges the final transformation, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding where stories live) to collective awakening (reminding stories they're loved). The tessellation scene creates meaningful tightening as she steps into another dimension, with cost paid through the scarf's transformation and her integration into the story-field.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the analog/digital divide and the notion that stories need human connection to live. The final image of warmer, heavier pages offers a non-literal answer about memory and narrative permanence without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scientific precision ("Riemannian manifolds") with poetic sensibility ("shadows threading between bookshelves"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through pressure, particularly in how she experiences the amphitheater's synesthetic qualities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("spiraling bookshelves that curved upward into impossible vaults"). The harmonic intervals sung as "Riemannian manifolds" shows controlled inventiveness despite occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of library science, hyperbolic geometry, and narrative metaphysics creates genuine originality. The concept of stories as living entities in mathematical space transforms familiar elements through specific execution, with risk-taking in the dimensional shift paying off at closure.</comment>
