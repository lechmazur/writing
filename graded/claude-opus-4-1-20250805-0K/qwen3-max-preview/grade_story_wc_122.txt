<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's deafness creates genuine constraints that shape her teaching methods and final breakthrough. The students' transformations feel earned through embodied reactions (veteran crying, girl laughing at her own pulse), though some emotional transitions could be more gradual. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully in the numbness/presence tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the broken needle transforming from "useless" to "catalyst," and the filament of hush evolving from fragile to "resilient, radiant." The backward music creates a decisive turn that reweights the entire teaching practice. Cost is visible in the students' raw responses and Elara's risk of losing her thread.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern functions as more than backdrop—drums provide sympathetic resonance, the space transforms from "sanctuary of controlled quiet" to where "silence learned to scream." Sensory details (resin, burnt sage, vibrations through spine) are POV-filtered through Elara's non-hearing perspective. The broken needle becomes the micro-setting that constrains and enables the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elara's personal numbness to collective healing through the backward music experiment. The reversal technique forces genuine risk—she could lose her students or deepen their trauma. Cost manifests in vulnerable exposure: "dragged numbness out into the open, where it writhed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of teaching silence as music and finding presence through disruption. The backward music literalizes emotional reversal without stating it. Final image of "hands on drums, needle on groove, the world reversed, ready to be felt" resonantly answers the numbness question through embodied practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice manages deafness authentically—rhythm known "through fingertips pressed to drumskins." Lyrical compression works ("filament of hush," "audibly muted void") though occasionally edges toward purple. The single signed word "Again" provides perfect tonal closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence ("cedar staves curved like ribs," "melodies inverted into question marks") but suffers from repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in the phonograph sequence. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("scalpel," "key," "catalyst" for the needle) creates mild overwriting. Information density generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The deaf music teacher teaching through vibration offers genuine freshness, elevated by the backward music as healing method—transforming grandfather's folk wisdom into therapeutic practice. The specific synthesis of deafness, drums, and reversed sound creates something memorable beyond typical trauma-healing narratives.</comment>
