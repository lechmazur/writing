<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between memory preservation and societal exile drives genuine choices, particularly the decision to teach despite danger. Embodied emotion through tide-synchronized skin and bleeding feet avoids label-speak. The final choice to teach carries visible cost (exposure risk) though some motivational depth could strengthen the exile's initial impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the protagonist transforms from fugitive to teacher, with villagers' arrival crystallizing this shift. The moonstone discovery provides causal linkage to the dance-inscription and teaching decision. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion, bleeding feet, and risk of breaking exile. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks (villagers arriving) reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden functions as micro-setting that enables the dance-inscription through its isolation and moss surface that receives blood. Sensory detail ("dew-laced moss," "velvet hush of petals folding") is selective and purposeful. The moonstone dust's properties (storing resonance) are specific to this world's nostalgia ban context, though more environmental constraint on choices would elevate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving memory vs. safety) is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone discovery forces a choice between private remembrance and public inscription. The villagers' arrival creates pressure that crystallizes into teaching despite danger. Cost is legible in physical toll and exposure risk, though escalation could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the gap-observation method and dance-as-inscription metaphor without explicit moralizing. The final teaching moment ("trust they'll catch you") offers a non-literal answer about memory's resilience. The moonstone's transformation from dust speck to "permanent asterisk" resonantly reweights loss into mark-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through tide-body synchronization and attention to gaps/absences. Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression ("She danced past midnight, past fatigue, past fear"). No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout. Slight register elevation in places ("gravitational sighs") but serves the piece's mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each step was choreography, each sway a stanza"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("cosmic verse on mortal skin") but pattern-taught and paid off. Minor template cadence in "She danced past/until" sequences. Clear propulsion maintained though occasional elevated diction ("obsidian grace") could simplify.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban concept freshly reframes memory as contraband, transforming exile trope through specific dance-as-writing metaphor. Tide-synchronized body offers non-obvious angle on embodied memory. Risk-taking in lyric structure and sustained metaphor heightens stakes, though some elements (moonstone, garden) feel slightly familiar.</comment>
