<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The child's internal contradiction between inherited deception and sought fairness drives genuine choices under pressure, with embodied details like weeping "from recognition" and the first "unguarded expression." The mortician and other seekers provide secondary pressure that tests the child's values. Motivation occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("mathematics of fair trade") but recovers through concrete actions like stealing, waiting actively, and choosing not to charge for the ink's use.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the child's transformation from thief to "architect" with visible cost in vulnerability and participation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of distributed fairness. Orientation anchors clearly (funeral home, midnight, child with ink pot) and causality tracks cleanly. The cost could be more visceral at the final beat—the "mathematics of fair trade" as "practice/presence" feels conceptually valid but emotionally distant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting that enables the central action—sterile fluorescents illuminate the ink, embalming tools create death-context, the mortician's proximity adds pressure. Sensory details like "burnt parchment and ozone" and "liquid obsidian" are selective and purposeful. The setting constrains choices through shift changes and footstep timing but could more directly shape the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—balancing inherited lies through fair trade—deepens as others arrive seeking their own recalibrations, with the child's choice to share rather than hoard marking the key turn. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens as each visitor adds weight to the transformation. The cost registers more conceptually than viscerally; while "vulnerability" and "participation" are named as prices, their immediate pressure could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "deathly vitality" and transformation without force, avoiding direct moralizing until the near-end abstractions. The ink's liquefying of rigid thinking operates as functional metaphor throughout. The recurring image of waiting actively charges the ending, though the final third occasionally drifts toward thesis ("mathematics of fair trade was not an abstract formula. It was practice.") rather than embodied resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with distinctive touches like "deathly vitality—the paradox of stillness that teems with purpose" and selective perception of mortician details. POV control is stable throughout. Dialogue between child and mortician carries subtext effectively ("I'm the con's conscience"). Some register elevation occurs in peak moments ("sacrament," "recalibrated") that slightly exceeds the child's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("As the ink flowed, the paper trembled") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "mathematics of fair trade" and occasional template cadence ("It was practice. It was presence. It was..."). Information density is high in action beats but dilutes in the philosophical final section. The closing image sequence maintains momentum despite abstraction creep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of magical ink that liquefies rigid thinking in a funeral home offers a fresh synthesis, particularly the "con's conscience" identity reversal. The accumulation structure of visitors each seeking recalibration feels earned. Originality is somewhat diminished by the predictable arc toward communal healing and the retreat into abstraction ("architect of fairness/flow/ink") rather than maintaining the specific edge established earlier.</comment>
