<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses throughout—the narrator's trembling versus laughing memory, Elias's silence versus eventual engagement. The final choice to reconnect despite imperfection is earned through concrete sensory memories (jasmine, vanilla, smoke). Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("rough as torn sheet music") rather than pure embodiment in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—two broken people reconnecting imperfectly while the orchard awaits destruction. The induced currents sequence transforms memory into shared experience, making reconciliation possible. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from past betrayal to present apology to fragile reconnection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sheet music archive as "mausoleum of melodies" constrains the encounter beautifully, and the perfume bottle's scent becomes tangible through electrical current. The orchard's impending destruction creates temporal pressure. Some spatial choreography could be clearer during the electrical demonstration sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation before the orchard's destruction) tightens through the perfume bottle demonstration that makes their shared history visible. Cost is legible—"not healed, not whole, but humming with the same flawed frequency." The escalation through sensory memory to visible threads to manuscript exchange works, though the middle demonstration section could use sharper pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically through the flawed symphony, messy reconciliation, and final image of two broken things reconnecting without full healing. The ending reweights everything—the mocked symphony becomes their shared creation, flaws included. Strong resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("ghosts who still whispered through staff lines"). Clean POV control throughout, with selective perception reflecting the narrator's guilt and purpose. Dialogue carries strong subtext—"Like cheap wine"/"Like us" exchange lands perfectly. Minor register elevation in places ("cushioned by what had passed between them") slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong information density. Some overwriting in the electrical demonstration sequence with mixed metaphors (threads/serpents/fireflies). Template cadence appears briefly ("She'd laughed then. Now, she trembled"). The "sheet music archive just as the hush before the orchard's trees" opening is syntactically tangled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcist-as-advice-columnist with electrical conductivity making memory visible. The specific combination of elements feels organic rather than assembled. The perfume bottle as memory vessel transformed through induced currents offers genuine originality, though the reconciliation arc itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
