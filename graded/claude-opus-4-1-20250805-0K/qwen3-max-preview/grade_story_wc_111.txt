I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration where the garden acknowledges the gardener's reciprocal relationship.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vine dresser's motivation crystallizes through embodied action (polishing marbles as counter-narrative) and her forty-seven springs of conviction manifest in concrete choices. Her refusal of probability bands and defense of reciprocity drives genuine stakes. The final moment where she accepts the garden's acknowledgment completes her arc with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fireflies mirror her marble spirals and the vine curls around her ankle—the garden's consent made visible. The accumulative structure coheres through marble-memory-reciprocity linkage. Cost appears in her isolation from the algorithmic world and physical toll ("rose stiffly"), though the emotional price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The maze functions as both physical constraint and philosophical battleground, with vines "rewriting the map daily" in organic rebellion. Sensory detail filters through her expertise ("soil remembers," jasmine recognition). The marbles-as-micro-setting constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image when fireflies echo their arrangement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving reciprocity versus algorithmic control, with the intern's interruption providing concrete external pressure. Her choice to stay and trust intensifies through the "Sector 7 compliance" threat. While the conflict deepens meaningfully, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off—she wins without visible sacrifice beyond existing isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the marble ritual as "mended deception"—mutual pretense that creates resilience. The reciprocity concept develops through concrete images (moonflower vs frost, wisteria survival) rather than assertion. The ending's firefly spirals offer a non-literal answer about gardens knowing gardeners without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with selective perception ("soil remembers," "leaves rustled like turning pages"). The perceptual signature shows in how she reads the garden's responses as recognition. Brief dialogue stays functional and contrasts her earthiness with bureaucratic jargon, though more distinction could elevate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery ("knuckles gnarled as old rootstock," "heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness") with good density. Some repetitive structures appear ("She polished," "She believed," "She smiled") and occasional abstraction ("reciprocity blooms in the unseen"). The accumulative design justifies some repetition but a few passages could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of garden-as-sentient-partner resisting algorithmic quantification offers fresh angle on nature/technology tension. "Mended deception" as mutual survival strategy shows conceptual originality. Specific details (tea leaves for wisteria, snowdrop petal saved) avoid generic pastoral, though the wise-crone-versus-bureaucracy frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
