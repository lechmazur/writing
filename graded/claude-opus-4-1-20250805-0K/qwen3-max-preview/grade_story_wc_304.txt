<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The beautician mortician's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving consciousness at death's threshold—with concrete embodied details like "fingers stilled above the cold brow." The scholar's request for "lucid awareness at the brink" creates genuine stakes. However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("rhythm of pause," "architecture of cessation") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the protagonist makes no difficult micro-choices that reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the emerald chip capturing the scholar's final conscious moment creates a "silent constellation" of preserved awareness. Cost is visible in "her hands trembling not with grief but reverence" and the irreversibility of the preservation ritual. The pattern of stillness accumulates effectively toward the ending vision of joining this constellation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early through "skyborne grotto under aurora."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto setting directly constrains and enables the ritual—"stalactites of condensed skylight dripped slow photons" that "pooled like liquid radiance" create the specific conditions needed for preservation. Rich sensory detail filters through the mortician's professional perception: "oil distilled from frozen moonpetals," "powder starlight." The environment actively participates in the closure as she envisions placing chips "in the high currents" under aurora's gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing consciousness before oblivion—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's progression, with the emerald chip pulsing "green and deep as a forest at midnight" marking successful preservation. However, no meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual proceeds without complication or choice that would narrow options. Cost appears only in emotional response ("hands trembling") rather than foreclosed paths or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of preserving "the last conscious instant before dissolution"—exploring liminal states between life and death without explicit moralizing. The final image of joining "the silent constellation of those who chose to watch" offers resonant closure that reweights the opening's preparation. Subtext operates through the mortician's reverence and the scholar's willing participation. The concept avoids tidy resolution, embracing the ambiguity of preserved consciousness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric control with distinctive perceptual signature: "listening to the hiss between radio frequencies, watching snow on dead screens." Rhythmic prose modulates effectively—short, reverent phrases during the ritual ("She would not bury him. She would not mourn him.") create ceremonial cadence. No dialogue appears, preventing full assessment of that dimension. Focalization remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance appropriate to the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Stalactites of condensed skylight dripped slow photons onto the floor" simultaneously establishes setting, atmosphere, and the magical realism register. Strong verb choices ("hovering," "coaxing," "infuse") and specific nouns avoid generic descriptors. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm without algorithmic patterns. Minor density issues in abstract passages ("rhythm of pause, the hidden architecture of cessation") don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of a beautician mortician preserving consciousness at death's threshold offers genuine freshness, combining familiar death-work with speculative preservation technology. Specific details like "silk spun from cloud-moths" and "oil distilled from frozen moonpetals" create memorable texture. The transformation of death from ending to threshold demonstrates conceptual integrity. The floating grotto setting and aurora-derived technology avoid generic choices.</comment>
