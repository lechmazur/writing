<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from exile to renewed purpose is coherent and earned through concrete details (worry stone, memories of pupils). The character makes a genuine choice to carry forward his knowledge differently, though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's shift from anxious exile to purposeful teacher, with cost visible in years of banishment. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on reflection without sufficient present-moment pressure to fully earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus creates atmospheric pressure and the worry stone's dent becomes a tactile anchor that evolves from anxiety totem to directional compass. The twilight setting and auroral details effectively mirror internal states without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in exile—is clear but lacks concrete opposition or escalation. The "magnetic field surge" provides atmosphere but doesn't force choices; the protagonist's decision to teach others feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in difficulty emerges organically through the chess tutor's journey from clinical precision to embracing wonder. The final image of walking forward "one correlated step at a time" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the reflective protagonist, with strong perceptual signature in phrases like "bruised violets" and "silence between collapsing stars." Some passages drift toward purple prose ("magnetic nexus flared—a silent symphony") but generally serve the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is moderate with purposeful rhythm variation, though several passages loop conceptually ("correlate," "translate silence" appear repetitively). The prose occasionally strains for profundity ("fractures let in light—and sometimes, magnetic fields") at the expense of clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess mastery, magnetic phenomena, and philosophical meditation creates a distinctive premise. The specific detail of the worry stone's single dent and the "eclipsed covenant" concept show originality, though the exile-finds-meaning arc follows familiar patterns.</comment>
