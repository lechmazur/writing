<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through the scent-triggered memory avalanche and the physical buckled knees. The protagonist's transformation from grief-avoidance to acceptance shows genuine internal conflict acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("sorrow's weight") rather than fully embodied states throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the UV-revealed memory glyphs building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as memory broker. The cost is visible in seventeen years of sealed grief now opened. Slight deduction for the orientation arriving late (greenhouse location not fully anchored until several paragraphs in).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choice effectively—she must come here to confront extinct scents. Vivid sensory detail in the UV light revealing memory glyphs and crystal shadows. The micro-setting of the vial and UV lamp function as environment. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("skeletal vines and spectral petals") that could be more specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of confronting grief deepens through the UV revelation that transforms understanding of memory's physical presence. Agency shown through her choice to open the sealed vial and use the UV lamp purposefully. The cost of seventeen years of avoidance is felt, though the escalation could tighten more dramatically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that "smells bypass thought; they tunnel straight into the marrow of moments." The final image of her becoming a memory broker for others offers a non-literal answer to why scents trigger tears. The UV-revealed glyphs avoid abstraction by making memory literally visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how she notices scents and their emotional resonance, with controlled psychic distance shifts during the memory flood. Some register drift into elevated diction ("cathedral of revelation") that doesn't fully match the established voice. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity during the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the UV revelation sequence. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("nostalgia's currency," "guardian, curator, silent lantern-lighter") and some repetitive structures in the closing paragraphs. The transformation sequence maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-physical-substance revealed through UV light, transforming the familiar grief narrative. The specific detail of memory glyphs appearing as "handwritten letters suspended in twilight" feels original. Risk-taking in the fantastical UV revelation heightens stakes without losing emotional grounding.</comment>
