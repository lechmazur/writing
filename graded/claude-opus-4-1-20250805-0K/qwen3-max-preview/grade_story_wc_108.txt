<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's vulnerability-as-strength arc lands with earned transformation, embodied through trembling hands that steady into purposeful action. Interior contradiction plays effectively through the phobia-ridden stunt double who "moves like fear given legs" yet confronts betrayal with adaptive certainty. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the crack through which truth enters") that briefly abstracts the emotional state rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the burning of evidence that transforms betrayal into liberation, with visible cost in the protagonist's trembling certainty becoming "forged in betrayal, baptized in trembling certainty." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer (shell whispers, cast notes, film burning) toward density shift at closure. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality opacity around how the shell's supernatural guidance functions within the story's reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rusted library setting constrains choice effectively—the protagonist must navigate "past the collapsed astronomy section" to reach the projector, and the "iron rafters bowed like tired spines" create atmospheric pressure. Setting participates in closure as embers rise "toward the rafters, painting the rusted library in flickering gold." Some generic elements ("forgotten stars," "splintered floorboards") lack the specificity that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis through betrayal revelation to the confrontation with evidence, with the dominant stake of reclaiming agency after betrayal signaled early and maintained throughout. The tightening occurs when decrypting the cast reveals the mentor's complicity, forcing the choice to burn rather than expose. Cost is legible in the transformation from victim to "someone firmly adaptive," though the resolution's ease (film burns "instantly") slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete journey from betrayal to liberation, with the shell serving as a resonant motif that shifts from "cursed sensitivity" to guide to silent witness. The ending offers a non-literal answer about vulnerability as power through action rather than statement. Minor deduction for the slightly overt thematic claim "even the most broken, trembling thing—me—can turn betrayal into liberation" that edges toward direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "dissolved like sugar in rain" and "move like fear given legs," with controlled modulation from trembling uncertainty to firm resolution. The perceptual signature is consistent—a mind that maps fractures and decodes patterns. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent throughout with purposeful compression during high-stress moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("iron rafters bowed like tired spines") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Template cadence appears in "I used to be... I'm just... I'm here to" construction. Some paraphrase loops ("firmly adaptive—not by choice, but by survival" followed immediately by explanation) and register drift into elevated diction ("baptized in trembling certainty") reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a phobia-ridden stunt double who excels because directors say they "move like fear given legs" offers fresh specificity, and the detail of decoding childhood doodles as encrypted confessions shows originality. The transformation of betrayal into liberation through burning evidence rather than exposing it provides a non-obvious resolution. Some familiar elements (mentor betrayal, cursed object) prevent higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
