<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rebuild faith through archaeological reverence is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like roots "curling gently around her wrists." The internal journey from doubt to renewal tracks causally through specific discoveries. Loses points for some abstract emotional labeling ("cautious enchantment") and the convenience of villagers arriving at the perfect moment without prior setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the sundial's restoration enables communal faith renewal. The cost is visible in Elara's permanent rootedness ("She never left"). Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and the convenience of the villagers' arrival timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting directly constrains and enables choices—roots guide excavation, bones reveal stories, the sundial's displacement mirrors spiritual dislocation. Vivid sensory details like "petals fell upward" and "roots threading between femurs" create atmosphere while serving the narrative. The setting functions as character, responding to Elara's reverence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of restoring faith deepens through archaeological discoveries that build context (ancestor stones, solstice alignments). Escalation reads through accumulative pressure rather than reversals. The cost of permanent rootedness lands clearly, though the villagers' arrival feels unearned causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sundial-as-faith metaphor: "faith, like the sundial, needed only reorientation to speak again." The concept of interrupted journeys that root rather than end resonates without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for the overly neat thematic statement about faith being "a rhythm to tend."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("erosion-scoured glyphs," "a sigh of wind through ribcages"). Some register elevation in places ("diaspora returnee," "spiritual dislocation") slightly exceeds the intimate POV established. The prose maintains consistency through emotional modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("where roots still snake between bones, the diaspora returnee became the orchard's quiet compass") and occasional abstract phrasing ("purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeology, faith restoration, and botanical horror creates a fresh angle on spiritual return narratives. The image of roots embracing bones while petals fall upward is memorably specific. The transformation of diaspora into rooting rather than arrival offers genuine insight, though some elements feel slightly derivative of magical realism conventions.</comment>
