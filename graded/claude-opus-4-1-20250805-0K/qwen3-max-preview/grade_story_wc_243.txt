<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is deeply rooted in preserving intimate moments over grand gestures, with internal contradiction between loss and continuation embodied through concrete actions like kneeling at the jetty and transcribing with walnut ink. The covenant regeneration through "proximate causes" creates genuine character-driven escalation. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("haunted euphoria") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to continue archiving lands with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the archivist's ritual building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where continuing to archive becomes both burden and devotion. The covenant's regeneration through small acts (recipe-learning, returned gloves) creates legible cost in the acceptance of generational responsibility. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the covenant's initial breaking being told rather than dramatized, though the closure lands cleanly with "stitch by ink-stained stitch."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty with its "salt-crusted planks" and "twilight-blooming jasmine" creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal state, while walnut ink's properties ("smelled of forests and endings") constrain the archival act. Setting actively shapes the ritual through tide movements and lantern lighting. Minor deduction for some ornamental description ("perfume of haunted euphoria") that doesn't advance pressure, though the jetty's transformation effectively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving "the weight of small moments" against institutional forgetting, with escalation through the archivist's deepening commitment from photo contemplation to active transcription. The covenant's regeneration creates meaningful tightening as personal memory becomes collective responsibility. Cost is visible in the disciplined restraint ("did not weep. Tears would blur the ink"). Deduction for relatively gentle pressure that could push harder against the protagonist's limits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between institutional memory and intimate preservation, with the locket photo and walnut ink serving as concrete vehicles for exploring permanence versus depth. The covenant clauses ("We will startle joy into the world") avoid abstraction through specific imagery. Final image of walking "beneath a sky just beginning to star" resonantly reweights the opening without stating a moral. Minor deduction for occasional thematic echo in phrases like "small eternal weights."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with selective perception focused on archival details and sensory memory ("tea steam curled around a confession"). POV control is stable with appropriate narrative modesty about grandmother's inner life. Rhythm effectively modulates between longer contemplative sentences and shorter declarative moments ("She did not weep"). Deduction for occasional register elevation ("haunted euphoria," "proximate causes") that strains against the intimate tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with vivid specificity in "walnut ink" and "silver grain" photography. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for figurative density that occasionally obscures clarity ("perfume of haunted euphoria"), some abstract phrasing ("regenerated covenant" appears without sufficient grounding), and minor repetition of "proximate causes" without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist concept offers fresh specificity, transforming the archive-keeper trope through focus on material preservation methods and small-scale memory work versus institutional records. The covenant regeneration through accumulated small acts rather than grand gestures provides non-obvious emotional truth. Setting details like "twilight-blooming jasmine" through jetty cracks avoid generic atmosphere. Slight deduction for safety in emotional resolution that could risk more ambiguity.</comment>
