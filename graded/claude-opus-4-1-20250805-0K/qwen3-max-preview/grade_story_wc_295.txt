<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's motivation to transmute grief into healing words is consistently embodied through concrete actions like singing to the guardian and writing poems to stars. Her internal conflict between witnessing and carrying burdens plays out through dramatized choices, particularly in the dream sequence where she actively chooses to share the weight. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("quiet redemption") rather than fully embodied states in early passages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered revelations about stars as burden-holders, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the chronicler transforms from passive receiver to active redistributor. The cost is visible in her "trembling fingertips" and the weight she accepts. The shift from understanding stars speak burdens to actively redistributing them through song creates meaningful closure with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory and astral dream-realm effectively constrain choices—the chronicler must use star charts and temple glyphs as her only tools for translation. Sensory details like "ink-stained fingers," "brittle envelope," and "daylily scent" are selective and purposeful. The setting actively shapes the solution: only through the observatory's charts can she decode the burden-transfer system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—continuing the chain of burden-sharing—escalates from academic translation to urgent rescue of the trapped guardian, then expands to establishing a new covenant of mercy. The pressure tightens when the telegram reveals she's "the only one left," forcing immediate action. The cost manifests in her acceptance of perpetual burden-bearing: "Tomorrow, another burden."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete system of stars absorbing and redistributing human sorrow, avoiding abstract moralizing. The daylily's ephemeral nature subtly parallels the need to capture fleeting truths. The final transformation of the observatory from "cold calculation" to "sanctuary" resonates without stating a moral, offering a non-literal answer about how shared grief becomes grace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the dream sequence. The perceptual signature shows through her tendency to translate everything into linguistic terms ("transmute sorrow into syntax"). Minor issues with occasional register elevation ("celestial siblings") that doesn't fully match the established voice, though the overall texture remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly effective in the dream sequence's shorter, more urgent constructions. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("stars spoke in burdens, not light" followed immediately by more star metaphors) and occasional template constructions ("She'd spent years learning to..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of stars as cosmic burden-sharers offers a fresh angle on grief and healing, executed through specific world-building rather than generic metaphor. The transformation of astronomical observation into spiritual practice feels earned. The risk of lyrical density mostly pays off, though some passages edge toward overwrought.</comment>
