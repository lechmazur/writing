<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between jealousy of past selves and acceptance of fragmented time, with embodied emotion through "ink-stained fingers trembling." The protagonist's choice to write/distill rather than flee shows clear motivation under pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("feral nostalgia") that could be more concretely embodied, though the concept earns its keep through the hunting sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist accepts chronological confusion as creative power ("I'm the one braiding the threads"). Cost is visible in the grave acceptance and jealousy of past selves' innocence. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, post-cemetery) arrive promptly. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation, though "soar... through" lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mountain cabin setting provides constraint and atmosphere, with pine resin/damp wool grounding the opening. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (initially resists pen, then accepts ink). Minor deduction because the external mountain setting doesn't actively pressure the key choices—most constraint comes from internal/temporal elements rather than physical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern: scroll resists → younger self appears → writing flows → multiple selves emerge → final acceptance. The dominant stake (making sense of fractured time/feral nostalgia) tightens through each encounter with past selves. Cost is legible in the jealousy and the line "they still believed in clean endings." Slight deduction as the pressure remains largely internal without external complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of chronicling chaos while experiencing it, culminating in "now it has a shape. And a name. Mine." The birch bark scroll transforms from resistant surface to "warm as living skin," earning its symbolic weight. The ending reweights the grave from "verdict" to "footnote" without stating a moral. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("cartography of collapse") though largely earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm shifts ("I soar... Not away. Not toward. Just... through"). Perceptual signature clear in dream-chronicler's professional lens applied to personal crisis. Some elevated diction ("fossilized confession," "cartography of collapse") fits the protagonist's role but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. Strong control of fragments and short lines for emphasis at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment"). Information density high in most passages. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("feral nostalgia—not sweet longing, but rabid, snarling recollections") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding, though some conceptual repetition around the jealousy theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on memory/time fragmentation through the lucid dream chronicler profession, which organically justifies the surreal elements. The "feral nostalgia" concept transforms a familiar theme through specific imagery. The encounter with one's own grave as inciting incident offers originality. Slight deduction for familiar writerly protagonist trope, though the specific profession and birch bark medium add texture.</comment>
