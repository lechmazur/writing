I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curator's internal journey from bewilderment to awakening is earned through concrete discoveries, with the bathroom revelation serving as a credible turning point. Her interaction with nonlinear inheritance concepts shows genuine intellectual struggle rather than convenient epiphany. The final transformation feels motivated by accumulated experience, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the curator's shift from seeking forbidden knowledge to understanding inheritance as "resonance across possibilities," with clear cost in her dissolution of prior selves. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the orchard's transformation and the curator's layered realizations. The closure lands with "no longer bewildered, but awake" carrying conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astral orchard functions as more than backdrop, with trees bearing "translucent scrolls" and petals becoming versions of self that constrain the curator's final understanding. The bathroom's mundane specificity ("mildly mildewed," "leaky pipe") grounds the fantastical premise effectively. The setting actively shapes discovery, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity about "gaps" in catalogued lives to the visceral experience of touching petals that dissolve into skin, revealing alternate selves. The cameo blank's transformation from cold relic to warm vessel marks a clear tightening. Cost manifests in remembering "failing this quest, burning the orchard in despair," though the resolution could press harder on what's sacrificed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the curator's discoveries rather than declaration, with "nonlinear inheritance" evolving from abstract concept to lived experience of "resonance across possibilities." The bathroom as site of revelation cleverly undercuts pretension while honoring genuine insight. The final image of the orchard blooming brighter reweights all prior searching without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the curator's scholarly perspective, with phrases like "chronal sashes" and "embryonic stars" feeling earned rather than overwrought. The shift from external observation to internal revelation tracks cleanly. Some passages risk purple prose ("motes of stardust that glowed like pollen") but mostly serve the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fruit that pulsed like embryonic stars") while maintaining forward momentum through varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple purposes. However, some metaphorical density in peak moments ("second skeleton," "field to be harvested") slightly obscures clarity, and occasional abstraction ("resonance across possibilities") could ground more concretely.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bathroom-as-revelation-site subverts expectations while the nonlinear inheritance concept offers fresh perspective on legacy and choice. The pistachio shell cameo blank as vessel for prophecy shows inventive specificity. While astral orchards aren't entirely novel, the execution through accumulative detail and the curator's particular journey elevates familiar elements.</comment>
