I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered renaming acts and symbolic gestures that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where mercy itself is redefined through collective practice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's "retrocognitively trapped" state creates genuine internal tension between moving forward and reliving collective losses, with concrete embodiment through trembling hands and the tessera's bite. The final choice to rename mercy from passive to "aberrant" is earned through specific memories of children starving and healers turned away, though some interior passages lean toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through collective renaming that transforms the plaza from ruin to "cradle unbroken," with visible cost in Elira's bleeding palm and the survivors' "hollowed eyes." The accumulative structure builds through individual renamings ("beggar" to "keeper of stories") that crescendo into communal transformation, though the magistrate's conversion feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plaza's "skeletal remains" and "ash clung to every surface like powdered grief" create vivid atmosphere that shapes action—the chipped mosaic patterns guide Elira to hear silenced voices. The tessera functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (its edges must "bite"), though mid-story sections occasionally drift toward abstract space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative renaming acts that deepen stakes from personal (Elira's kneeling) to communal (survivors joining), with the magistrate's challenge providing genuine opposition. The cost manifests in blood, in accepting being "retrocognitively trapped," and in the weight of redefining mercy itself, though the universal acceptance of her philosophy reduces some tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete act of renaming—not erasing but reclaiming—with the tessera serving as compass rather than relic. The concept of "aberrant mercy" that "bleeds, and in bleeding, bound" avoids simple moralizing, and individual renamings ("fear" to "teacher with sharp teeth") resist sentimentality while building toward collective transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges in phrases like "mercy without consequence was theater" and the poetic "ash clung to every surface like powdered grief," with controlled psychic distance that pulls close for Elira's palm bleeding then widens for crowd scenes. However, register occasionally elevates beyond the POV's established baseline ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy") and some passages drift toward essay-like pronouncements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "tessera of a new mosaic, one she would assemble not on walls, but in law, in gesture, in breath" show purposeful rhythm, but repetitive "She renamed" constructions create template cadence. Several paraphrase loops appear ("Mercy, she decided, must no longer ask permission to act. It must break doors.") and abstract philosophizing occasionally stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of renaming as active practice rather than restoration offers fresh perspective on post-catastrophe narratives, with specific renamings ("orphan" to "seed of tomorrow") avoiding generic hope. The "gentle radical" who wields "justice like a blade but cradled empathy in arms of steel" transforms the revolutionary archetype, though some revolutionary rhetoric feels familiar.</comment>
