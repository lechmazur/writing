<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's trauma-driven interiority is concrete and embodied through "phantom twinges that flare when storms brew," and the final transformation from anchor to compass shows earned change with visible cost. The freeze moment crystallizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("calibration," "somatic markers") that occasionally abstracts embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through sketching, pearl imagery, and the arboretum collaboration toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where carrying "the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse" shows internalized change with felt cost. The freeze moment effectively deepens options. Slight deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally shown in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arboretum's "wind-rattled glass and salt-crusted benches" create lived-in specificity, and environment actively shapes choices through the fence gap, bench encounters, and tree hollows for sketches. The dewdrop-as-pearl discovery constrains and charges the final image meaningfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of processing trauma coheres through the freeze moment that transforms perception of the photograph from "relic of loss" to "frame of pure, unguarded joy." Cost is legible in "for the first time since the strike, I let myself cry without counting the tears." One meaningful deepening suffices, though the transformation could be more viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the coexistence of "ruin and regrowth" without stating morals, with the pearl metaphor accumulating meaning from dewdrop to internalized presence. The final insight that "stillness is not the absence of chaos, but the eye within it" reweights prior material resonantly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in noticing "how moss climbs stone in spirals, how gulls time their cries between waves." Voice maintains consistency through trauma-informed selectivity. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into clinical language ("somatic markers," "calibration") that slightly distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "wind halts mid-sigh, leaves pause their rustle" with good rhythm variation. Some repetitive structures ("I return," "I come," "I carry") and filter constructions ("I see," "I find") reduce immediacy. Information density is generally high with purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The freeze as somatic response to trauma offers a non-obvious angle, transforming expected PTSD narrative through stillness-as-healing rather than exposure therapy. The arboretum as collaborator and sketching as recovery method show specific choices beyond template trauma recovery.</comment>
