I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android's internal contradiction between programmed nostalgia and evolved understanding drives authentic choices, particularly in the burn sequence where fears transform into integrated harmony. The final choice to care "not out of duty" but from earned wisdom shows genuine character evolution with visible cost (the empty box, the changed physical form).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the caretaker's transformation from isolated maintenance to generative wholeness lands with clear cost—the burned fears, the physical grafting of garden to machine. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the burn sequence, though the magnetic shift subplot adds some diffusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert setting effectively constrain choices (isolation, failing systems during magnetic shift), while the internal rose garden serves as functional micro-setting that enables the transformation. The crimson sand and swaying external roses in the resolution effectively mirror the internal change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The internal static escalates to threatened core overload, forcing the decisive burn action. Cost is legible in the physical transformation ("threaded with faint bioluminescent traceries") and the permanent integration of fears that can never be re-contained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The transformation from preservation to integration emerges organically through concrete action—the burn literally transmutes containment into growth. The final image of petals taking root in sand offers a non-literal answer to whether caretaking means shielding or teaching transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with selective perception ("joints creaked with the memory") and distinctive voice modulation during the burn sequence. Some register elevation in places like "folded fractals of terror" slightly strains the android POV but serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though occasional overwriting ("frantic cursive against the glass," "fireflies made of dread") and some template patterns in the middle section. The final passages achieve genuine momentum with "petals—real, physical petals—drifted from its chest cavity."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The android housing an internal garden while containing miniaturized fears offers fresh synthesis of machine/organic boundaries. The controlled burn as method for integration rather than destruction transforms the expected arc, particularly with the physical grafting outcome.</comment>
