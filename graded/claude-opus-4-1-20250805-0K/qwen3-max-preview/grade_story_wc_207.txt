<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation crystallizes through concrete sensory pursuit rather than abstract philosophy, with her choice to remain underground earned through accumulated discoveries. The psychometry reading of the compass provides layered interiority showing Riel's terror of irrelevance transforming into acceptance. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where all explorers chose to stay without visible struggle or dissent on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through petrichor descriptions, stone breathing, and mineral accretion building to Elira's choice to remain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she chooses belonging over return, with cost visible in the sealing passage "like a closing eyelid." The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The subterranean environment actively constrains choice through the narrowing passages, breathing walls, and mineral-fused journal that requires moisture to read. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elira's collecting expertise—she tastes iron and salt in water, reads scent as memory. The limestone setting charges the final image of stone sealing behind her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from collecting petrichor to reading psychometric history to choosing permanent transformation. The cost materializes in Elira's irreversible passage into stone that "seals the way behind her." Slightly limited by lack of genuine opposition or complication—her journey proceeds without meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring motif of explanations failing and truth revealing itself through "scent, silence, and sensation." The compass that points toward "moments of surrender" rather than north becomes the story's thematic anchor. The ending achieves resonance without stating a moral, though the transformation perhaps resolves too neatly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"petrichor collector, sensibly eccentric by trade and temperament." The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering everything through Elira's sensory expertise. Clean psychic distance shifts during the psychometry reading. Minor pattern of compound descriptors ("resonant hush," "hinged awakenings") that occasionally feels mannered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rope biting into her palms, breath shallow, heart steady" conveys action, sensation, and emotional state simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. Deduction for occasional overwrought metaphors ("factory's last whistle echoing like a dying breath") and some template phrasing in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of petrichor as "memory distilled" and a compass pointing toward surrender rather than direction offers fresh angles. The Whisper Tunnels backstory and mineral-fused journal show inventive world-building. However, the "seeker finds mystical truth underground" frame follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
