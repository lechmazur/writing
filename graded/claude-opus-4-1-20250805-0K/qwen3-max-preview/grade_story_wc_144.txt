<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her unique repair method through water refraction, and her motivation to "decode feedback into direction" drives consistent choices. The final renunciation (turning to the next broken thing rather than savoring success) carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("calm was her compass") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elara completes the repair and immediately turns to the next broken thing, showing her endless cycle with visible cost ("grieving widow" waiting). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and repair process build toward the drone's resurrection. Deduction for slight orientation delay (blindness revealed late in first paragraph) and some causality softness in how the water refraction method actually fixes the drone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The depot setting actively constrains through the tide deadline and ship's departure, while sensory details (vibrations through rails, mist, anchor groans) are filtered through Elara's non-visual perception. The water basin and prism become micro-settings that enable the repair method. Strong integration of setting with character's blindness creates a lived-in world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the tightening deadline (anchor lifting, tide turning) that would destroy a decade of research if the drone fails. The botanist's silent waiting adds pressure without interruption. Cost is visible in Elara's immediate turn to the grieving widow's music box, showing the endless demand on her skills.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: transformation of broken things into flight paths, with the drone's resurrection paralleling larger patterns of repair and redemption. The final image of Elara listening to "the silent gratitude of things made whole again" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the botanist's gasp at the orchids responding to the repaired drone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature filtered through non-visual senses ("felt them in the tremor of a gear's hesitation"). Some elevated diction ("alchemy of repair," "pilgrim at a sacred spring") occasionally strains against the artisan POV but serves the mythic tone. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("salt-tinged sky, carrying pollen and promise") and some template structures ("She didn't need...she felt"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor loops in the emotional register descriptions detract from otherwise strong line-level control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The blind artisan using water refraction to repair drones offers a fresh synthesis, and the integration of sensory compensation with technical skill feels non-obvious. The specific repair method and the drone-orchid symbiosis avoid generic templates. Some familiar beats (racing against time, silent observer) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
