<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between her role as destroyer and restorer creates genuine tension through embodied details like "bones as tuning forks" and the physical act of turning the crank. The revelation that she is the swapped heir drives a credible identity crisis with visible cost, though some passages drift toward ornamental description ("dynasty ender" as repeated label) rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's understanding pivots from destroyer to rightful heir, with clear cost in the loss of her assumed identity. Causality holds through the gramophone revelation, though the late introduction of the "swapped child" mechanism feels slightly convenient. The orientation anchors (reading room, evening, dynasty context) arrive within acceptable windows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room functions as more than backdrop—its "mahogany table," "yellowed spines," and connection to family history constrain and enable the protagonist's discovery. Sensory details like "golden shadows pooled like spilled honey" and the physical gramophone mechanics ground the scene. The clocktower/hollow revelation provides specific spatial stakes for the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from uncovering truth to confronting personal identity when the voice proves to be her mother's, narrowing the protagonist's options between maintaining her destroyer role or pursuing restoration. The cost is visible in her frozen recognition and the irrevocable walk toward the clocktower. However, the conflict lacks intermediate pressure between setup and revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of silence as both oppression ("Golden Silence" policy) and revelation ("silence...the only language the dead still answered") emerges through concrete action rather than assertion. The standing waves metaphor connecting physical resonance to truth-seeking creates genuine thematic depth. The ending reweights the entire premise from destruction to restoration without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled psychic distance and purposeful compression ("eloquently silent—not from absence of voice"). The perceptual signature shows in how the protagonist processes the room through tactile and auditory channels. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("bruised violet and amber") but rhythm generally serves pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several passages suffer from ornamental overwriting: "the unseen architecture of consequence," "living lattice of memory and resonance." The standing waves section contains unnecessary abstraction that slows momentum. Template phrasing appears in "She remembered...She stepped...She rose" sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of using physical resonance/standing waves to decode emotional imprints shows genuine originality, avoiding typical archive-discovery tropes. The swapped heir revelation transforms the destroyer premise meaningfully. However, the dynasty-ending setup follows familiar patterns, and some metaphors ("golden shadows," "bruised sky") lack freshness.</comment>
