I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's silence as "native tongue" and his methodical restoration create a consistent, embodied character whose motivation crystallizes through action rather than exposition. His final choice to complete the carousel carries visible cost (lifelong dedication) though some interiority relies on abstraction ("silence became a chorus").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly—the carousel's completion transforms abandonment into sanctuary with palpable cost (the carpenter's permanent commitment). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the halo fragment's function wavers between catalyst and ornament, slightly weakening causal clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train functions as both setting and crucible, with specific details (murals of frozen acrobats, mannequin clowns) that constrain and enable the carpenter's work. The carousel itself becomes micro-setting that shapes the final transformation, earning the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the carpenter's recognition of the half-built carousel as either his past life's work or spiritual inheritance, narrowing his options to completion or abandonment. The cost is visible in his permanent dedication, though pressure could tighten more dramatically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of silence as creative force emerges organically through the carpenter's wordless song and the carousel's resurrection, offering a non-literal answer about beauty's persistence. The final image of the turning carousel reweights all prior abandonment imagery without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("mist curling around his boots like curious cats"), with rhythmic control that mirrors the carpenter's methodical work. The lyrical register maintains consistency even under pressure, creating a meditative voice that serves the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("silence became a chorus," "cathedral of whimsy"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He would...He would...") costs momentum but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The silent carpenter as artist-priest restoring abandoned beauty offers a fresh angle on the creation myth. The synthesis of circus imagery with sacred undertones feels specific and earned, though some symbolic elements (halo fragment) feel slightly convenient.</comment>
