<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to balance the world's "quiet axis" by unknotting silence is consistently enacted through embodied ritual work, with internal experience ("She hesitated. Some knots resisted. Some had teeth") differing from external calm. The fisherman's "I cut the line" confession crystallizes moral complexity without resolution, and the final choice to continue unknotting carries visible cost ("joints stiff"). Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the opening's "interlaced hush" before grounding occurs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through each knot's release ("boy's laugh," "mother's lullaby," "sailor's oath") until the violent unraveling of the guilt-knot reweights all prior gentle releases. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the sanctuary itself becomes "unknotted," with visible cost in the protagonist's physical toll and the weight of endless future work. Minor orientation delay (who/where crystallizes gradually) but pays off in the prism sanctuary's transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The net functions as micro-setting that constrains each choice through its specific knots ("each knot a name, each strand a life"), while the prism sanctuary's starlight creates tangible atmosphere ("liquid whispers that pooled around her ankles"). The blackened guilt-knot's physical difference ("tight, blackened, pulsing faintly") directly shapes the protagonist's hesitation and the sanctuary's dimming response. Setting actively participates in closure when the sanctuary "sighed once, softly, and settled into a peace."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating releases until the guilt-knot creates genuine reversal—from gentle unraveling to violent rupture ("It unraveled violently, thread snapping"). The fisherman's confession "I cut the line. To save the others" forces moral reckoning without tidy resolution, and the protagonist's choice to continue despite physical toll shows agency with cost. Stakes remain primarily internal/spiritual rather than survival-based, appropriate for this lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of unknotting as metaphor for releasing held trauma, with the fisherman's impossible choice ("cut the line to save the others") resisting moral simplicity. The final image of the protagonist stepping into night "carrying not ghosts but grace" while "The future? Still knotted" offers resonant non-resolution that reweights the opening's promise of exhumation. Subtext operates through the net's physical properties and the spirits' non-verbal responses ("didn't thank her. Didn't need to").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines liturgical cadence ("She had come to exhume—not bones, not relics") with tactile specificity ("moon-silk spun from the last sigh of a drowned lullaby"). Perceptual signature shows selective attention to texture and weight over visual detail, consistent with a craftsperson's priorities. Minor register elevation in places ("lucid unrest," "spectral hues") but largely maintains coherent mystical-practical fusion throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks create visual rhythm, with information density high in lines like "each knot a name, each strand a life pulled too soon from the sea's cold grip." Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from the established voice ("cathedral of captured starlight," "liquid whispers"), and mild redundancy appears in explaining the sanctuary's properties. Line-level control remains strong through the crucial guilt-knot sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The conceit of a "broken mask restorer" who unknots spiritual silence offers fresh angle on ghost-laying traditions, with specific innovation in treating silence as "layered. Stitched. Knotted." The fisherman's moral paradox and the protagonist's acceptance of endless work without resolution avoid safety-middle choices. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the refusal of clear resolution heightens the piece's originality.</comment>
