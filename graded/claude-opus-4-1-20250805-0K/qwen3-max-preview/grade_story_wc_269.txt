<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's tapping rhythm as both superstition and scientific method creates a compelling internal contradiction, with her discovery journey earning the final renunciation of "searching for vanished paths." The transformation from witness to listener feels genuine, though some interior passages lean toward explanatory rather than embodied ("not policy, not fame, not even redemption").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery that coral hasn't died but metamorphosed, with clear cost shown in twenty years of hidden data and her mentor's desperate concealment. The accumulative/textural lens holds as tapping rhythms, sonar logs, and bioluminescent revelations build toward the crystallized understanding that "some losses aren't endings."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The monitoring station as a character itself—"creaking," "groaning like an old sailor"—constrains choices through its elevated position above drowned mangroves and its 17-second lag that reveals hidden protocols. Sensory details effectively narrow during discovery (salt-crusted emergence, waterlogged journal against generator housing), though some passages drift toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mystery (why paths vanish) through technological discovery (CALYPSO's hidden subroutine) to ecological revelation (coral's downward adaptation), with Elara's submersible descent forcing commitment to her hypothesis. The cost of twenty years of concealment and the mentor's torn page create genuine pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of metamorphosis versus loss emerges organically through the coral's adaptation, the tapping as "radar not ritual," and paths that "slowed, sank, and waited." The final teaching sequence where "children learned to count seconds between taps, giggling when the coral answered" offers a non-literal answer to loss without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific precision mixed with poetic observation ("drifting moored tone of her existence"), with controlled distance that allows both technical detail and emotional resonance. Some passages slip into explanatory mode ("That's why she tore the page—to hide the truth"), and dialogue absence prevents full voice distinction testing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments of propulsive clarity ("Below, through silt and gloom, bioluminescent coral spiraled upward") alternate with explanatory passages that slow momentum. Several paraphrase loops appear ("Paths hadn't disappeared. They'd submerged.") and some metaphors strain ("edges frayed like nerve endings"), though the closure sequence maintains clean urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reversal that coral adapted downward rather than dying transforms the familiar bleaching narrative, with the tapping-as-sonar discovery feeling earned through established pattern. The "tactile cartography" concept and fishermen's glowing gardens create fresh angles, though some elements (torn atlas page, mysterious mentor) lean toward familiar mystery tropes.</comment>
