<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation through "encrypting vulnerability as strength" drives consistent choices from dance-as-protocol to final self-erasure. The spider metaphor effectively embodies her patient methodology, though some passages lean toward abstraction ("emotional coordinates"). Her final choice to remain and rewrite herself rather than escape shows genuine cost and earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dance movements accumulate into system takeover, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira "vanishes—not dead, not gone, but rewritten." The cost is visible in her choosing dissolution over escape. However, the worldbuilding mechanics (Overseers, the Purge) arrive late without sufficient grounding, and some causal links between dance and technical effects strain credibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting actively constrains choices (37°C sensor threshold, flooded corridors requiring specific navigation) and provides resources (dormant submersibles, fissures for capsule launch). Phosphorescent algae and pressure gradients create lived-in specificity. The environment participates in closure when "water surged inward, not as destroyer but as veil."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from infiltration to liberation to self-sacrifice, with Elira's dance protocol creating genuine pressure against patrol drones. The dominant stake of encrypted resistance coheres throughout. However, the Overseers remain abstract antagonists, and the middle section lacks a concrete tightening moment before the final escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "liberation through resonance" emerges organically from Elira's methods, with the spider-web metaphor earning its weight through patient construction and tactical misdirection. The ending achieves resonance when survivors dance her steps, though some passages veer toward explicit thematic statement ("Let them mistake your retreat for surrender").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with strong rhythmic control ("silt-choked glass," "tide-bound ghost") and distinctive perceptual filtering through sonar/pressure gradients. However, register occasionally elevates beyond Elira's established lexicon ("emotional coordinates," "symmetric satisfaction"), and some passages read more like omniscient commentary than focalized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("corroded consoles whispering in static hymns") but suffers from density overload and occasional mixed metaphors. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("Glyph One: dissolve... Glyph Three: purge..."). Information density is high but sometimes sacrifices clarity for atmospheric effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of underwater espionage, dance-as-hacking protocol, and dice-based cryptography creates genuine originality. The specific detail of 37°C sensor thresholds and the mother's morse-tap lullaby avoid generic dystopia. Risk-taking in the self-erasure ending heightens stakes, though some worldbuilding elements feel underdeveloped.</comment>
