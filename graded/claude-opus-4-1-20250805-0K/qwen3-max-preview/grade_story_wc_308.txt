<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation to "navigate without moving" creates a compelling paradox that drives the entire piece, with internal consistency maintained through stillness-as-wisdom. The character's endurance and refusal to chase motion constitutes an Earned Stasis with visible cost ("centuries of layered dust"). Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the middle sections where embodied emotion could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught meditation on stillness that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the skimmer becomes "the landmark" rather than the seeker. The closure lands with conceptual cost—generations died seeking motion while the answer was stillness. The piece teaches its contemplative pattern early and maintains it throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tower of bones and canyon setting function as more than backdrop—they embody the accumulated time and failed attempts that give weight to the skimmer's vigil. Sensory details like "walls humming with ghosts of footsteps" and "fossilized marrow" create atmosphere while the arrowhead serves as a micro-setting object that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—deepens through the crow murmuration sequence where the skimmer reads the pulse and discovers "the next safe passage." Cost is visible in the centuries of waiting and the wanderers who died seeking motion. The escalation is textural rather than causal, appropriate to the piece's contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central paradox: "guidance is not given—it is mirrored." The piece resists easy morals, presenting stillness not as paralysis but as "alignment" with deeper frequencies. The final image of becoming the landmark rather than chasing the path offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the navigation question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and biblical/mythic register that suits the timescale and subject. Perceptual signature strong—the skimmer perceives through "marrow of its bones" and reads birds as musical notation. Purposeful compression and lyric mode taught early and sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with moments of genuine beauty ("black as obsidian shards," "physics dressed in reverence"). Some repetitive phrasing around "centuries" and "dust" creates minor loops. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("It did not... It did not... It simply knew") though this reads as intentional parallelism for effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core concept of navigation through stillness rather than motion offers a genuinely fresh angle on the journey archetype. The synthesis of geological time, bird augury, and contemplative practice creates something memorable. Risk-taking in the extremely passive protagonist pays off through the piece's commitment to its premise.</comment>
