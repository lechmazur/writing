I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered reflection and imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's grief crystallizes into "hauntingly practical" action through embodied details like "knees bracketing an ash wood carving blank" and the progression from passive sitting to active carving. Internal contradiction plays effectively between "Here and gone" and "never lost," though some interiority edges toward abstract ("loss wasn't an end, but a lens").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Earned Stasis closure lands with cost as Eleanor accepts grief's rhythm rather than conquering it, shown through the carved lion "eyes closed not in death, but in trust." The accumulative structure coheres through the carving's progression, though heavy reflection (>30%) occasionally abstracts the present frame, particularly in passages about Viktor's philosophy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight and cedar chest anchor the scene precisely, while sensory details like "rust-hued peace settling like dust" and "kettle's slow, metallic song" create atmosphere. The carving blank constrains choice and charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Eleanor's shift from attempting to "contain" memory to learning to "move with grief," with the carving serving as the pressure point. The kettle's escalating demands ("screamed again, urgent") provide temporal pressure, though the conflict remains largely internal without a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lion metaphor—"You don't conquer wild things; you learn their rhythm"—without explicit moralizing. The final image of the lion "curled around itself...in trust" resonantly answers the central question of how to hold loss, though Viktor's quoted wisdom occasionally approaches direct thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("Here and gone," "Let the water boil dry"). Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to craft details and circus memories, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("crystallize time...like amber holding a wing").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("rain-beaded skylight," "fine as a lion's whisker") with strong information density. However, paraphrase loops appear ("grief had crystallized...something hauntingly practical" echoes the prompt), and some metaphors strain ("lens" extended across multiple paragraphs).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lion taming and wood carving as grief work offers a non-obvious angle, particularly the inversion where the widow must learn the lion's lesson. The piece commits to its lyric mode, though relies somewhat on familiar grief-processing territory.</comment>
