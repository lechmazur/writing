<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tracer's motivation is beautifully rooted in preventing souls from fracturing through silence, with embodied emotion ("breath came in shallow hitches") and concrete interiority. The ghost girl's vulnerability and the tracer's compassionate response create genuine character-driven tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("emotional resonance") in opening beats that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost girl accepts her parents aren't returning but finds peace through acknowledgment of their love—a clear before/after with emotional cost visible in her tears and eventual calm. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from tracking pulses to finding the source to final resolution. Orientation anchors (atrium, twilight, contact tracer role) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with weeping condensation and floating lilies creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors the emotional landscape. The hearing aid as micro-setting constrains the tracer's method of detection. However, the setting doesn't actively shape the final choice beyond providing backdrop—the resolution could occur in various locations without fundamentally altering the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from detecting emotional echoes to discovering a trapped soul to helping her accept reality—each beat tightens options under the accumulative lens. The cost is visible in the girl's tears and the tracer's choice to kneel in damp conditions. However, the conflict lacks a strong opposing force; the girl's acceptance comes relatively easily once contact is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept that "love doesn't die—it just changes frequency," avoiding explicit moralizing while offering resonant insight about grief and connection. The photograph's transformation from vibrating urgency to calm rest at closure reweights its meaning. The tracer's role as intermediary between worlds explores liminal spaces with subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("boots whispering against marble veined with forgotten histories") and controlled psychic distance. The perceptual signature focuses on resonances and frequencies fitting the tracer's specialty. Minor register drift in places ("syncopated ache") that occasionally feels overwrought for the established tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. However, several instances of overwriting ("bruised twilight into liquid gold puddles," "voice low as falling ash") and some abstract phrasing reduce momentum. The opening is particularly dense with figurative language that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" who tracks emotional resonances offers a fresh angle on ghost stories and grief narratives. The specific method of using a dead hearing aid to tune frequencies shows imaginative world-building. Some elements feel familiar (ghost child waiting for parents) but the execution through frequency-tracking transforms the trope.</comment>
