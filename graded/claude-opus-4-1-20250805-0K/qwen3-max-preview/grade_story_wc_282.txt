<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—mapping emotions as existential purpose—with embodied reactions like thermal sensing and biothermal modulation. The transition from observer to participant represents earned change through the fossil's activation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("existential purpose") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to continue "no longer solitary" carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the fossil's transformation into a communication relay. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist becomes participant rather than observer, with cost visible in the fossil's dissolution. The orientation anchors (post-hibernation world, cave mapper) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave network functions as active setting—lichen responding to emotional frequencies, chambers holding specific emotions, the Tidal Sanctum enabling the fossil's activation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (thermal gradients, bioluminescent color shifts). The environment directly constrains and enables the protagonist's work, charging the final image of walking "deeper into the network."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: mapping emotions → fossil warming → thermographic question → biothermal response → dissolution into light. The stakes (translating what remains of humanity) intensify when the cave itself asks "Who remembers us?" Cost is visible in the fossil's sacrifice to become relay rather than relic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transitional object concept—the fossil literally transitions from relic to relay, carrying meaning across thresholds. The story resists simple preservation vs. progress binaries, embracing complexity in the protagonist's role as translator for the dormant. The final image of continuing "no longer solitary" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with specialized lexicon ("thermographic," "biothermal output") that fits the sensory mapper POV. Perceptual signature is unique—reading heat patterns as language, modulating body temperature as speech. Some elevated diction ("cathedral-like," "existential") occasionally drifts from the embodied register but remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("existential purpose," "factually mystical") and some elevated diction in peak beats ("lattice above her thickened"). The fossil transformation sequence maintains clarity despite complexity. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human archaeology with emotion-as-physical-substance. The concept of mapping thermal ghosts of feelings is original and executed with commitment. The transformation of communication from sound to temperature gradients represents genuine risk-taking that heightens stakes (+0.3 within band for unconventional choices that serve closure).</comment>
