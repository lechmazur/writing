<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's ability to taste memories drives her physical journey and emotional transformation, with clear internal conflict between absorbing and smoothing painful memories. The subsumption sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (staggering but not retreating), and her final choice to cook again carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hollowed but whole") that briefly dulls embodiment in transition moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught memory-tasting that builds to the coral pavilion's collective remorse being transformed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira emerges "hollowed but whole," having absorbed and smoothed the stored grief, with clear cost ("the contagion spent"). The tidal pool analysis method provides consistent internal logic, though the mechanics could be slightly more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desert fortress and coral pavilion create vivid, constraining environments that shape Elira's choices—gloves removed for necessary touch, following puddle reflections to find the hidden structure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (metallic tang, hoarfrost underfoot, liquid shadow). The setting transformation from ice to dew mirrors the emotional arc, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("bruised twilight sky").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—subsuming stored remorse—escalates from personal to collective as Elira descends, with clear cost when she removes gloves knowing the contagion risk. The tidal pool method guides her to the "still center" where she can work most effectively. Escalation through accumulation works under the textural lens, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of "sandpapering" memories—not destroying but smoothing them into bearable weight. The final transformation (coral to sand, remorse to soil) offers resonant answer without stating moral. Strong integration of cooking-as-healing metaphor ("knives now instruments of mercy"). The "neither she nor the dunes would ever name aloud" line edges toward meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("water pooling in crevices like forgotten promises") and consistent perceptual signature focused on taste/texture metaphors. POV remains stable with appropriate psychic distance shifts during the subsumption sequence. Strong rhythmic control, especially in the pavilion scene where syntax mirrors the overwhelming flood of memories.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("hollowed but whole," "petrichor and possibility"). Some figurative density in non-peak moments without clear payoff. The "sturdy brittle shell" oxymoron works but similar constructions accumulate. Information density is high and propulsion generally maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of tasting emotional residue on objects offers fresh angle on memory/trauma processing. The coral icebound pavilion as crystallized collective grief is striking and specific. Transformation of chef skills into emotional healing avoids simple metaphor. Some elements feel slightly overwrought (the specific method of tidal pool analysis), but overall synthesis feels earned.</comment>
