I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered ritual imagery and ceremonial accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where peace is "mustered" through collective ritual rather than negotiation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation coheres around transforming empty treaties into binding ritual, with concrete embodied details like "frayed conviction" and physical interaction with the clipboard. The transition from individual doubt to collective witness works, though secondary characters arrive too late to develop beyond archetypal "survivors." Internal conflict between despair and determination plays out through action rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear accumulative structure builds from solitary preparation through ritual inscription to collective signing, with the ebony clipboard serving as both literal and symbolic anchor throughout. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - peace achieved not through victory but through ritual significance and collective vulnerability. Cost is visible in the "imperfect mosaic of consent" and the acknowledgment that this is beginning, not completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The terrace setting constrains and enables the ritual - its volcanic stone, triple moons, and sacred history make it the only place where "oaths they could not break" can be sworn. Sensory details like "burnt sage and distant rain" and "iridescent ink" serve the ritual atmosphere. The "smoldering graveyard of ideals" below provides constant visual counterpoint to the hope above.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether ritual can succeed where diplomacy failed, with tension building through Elira's solitary preparation toward collective participation. The arrival of "survivors" rather than generals represents a meaningful shift in who has agency. However, the resolution comes too easily - no one resists or questions, reducing dramatic tension at the crucial moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between failed treaties and successful ritual, exploring how shared vulnerability might succeed where power politics failed. The mirror metaphor - "Sign it, and you sign your own reflection" - resonates without overstatement. The ending's "quiet, operatively gentle courage to begin again" reframes the entire negotiation tradition without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyrical control with purposeful compression and rhythm that supports the ceremonial tone. Phrases like "the Gray Accord" and "operatively gentle cadence" establish character-specific diction. The prose modulates effectively from introspective opening through ritual crescendo, though some constructions edge toward purple ("hesitant fireflies drawn to a gravity they could not name").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and imagery, but several overwritten passages strain clarity: "hesitant fireflies drawn to a gravity they could not name" and similar constructions. Information density is high - most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. The final sentence attempts too much, creating slight congestion at the crucial closure moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ritual-as-diplomacy concept offers fresh angle on war/peace negotiations, transforming expected confrontation into ceremonial vulnerability. The specific detail of meteorite ink and dove-bone pen creates texture beyond generic peace talks. However, the too-easy collective agreement and lack of resistance or complication at the climax reduces risk-taking where it matters most.</comment>
