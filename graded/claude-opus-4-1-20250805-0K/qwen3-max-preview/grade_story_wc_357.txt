I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered resonances and sensory accumulation toward a conceptual repricing about resilience being stored memory rather than inherent strength.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding the orchard's uncanny resilience—with concrete embodied details like "gloves gripped the throttle tight" and her weeping from recognition. The transformation from fixing to listening represents earned change with visible cost (returning each inversion). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("Not from awe. From recognition") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure: resilience reframed from growth to memory/echo, with the arrow becoming "rooted" and Elira's purpose shifting from piloting to echoing. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (dew spirals, inverted gravity, bio-resonance) toward this revelation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causal opacity around how the arrow actually functions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice through gravity inversion creating the one-hour window, dew-trails serving as navigation, and tech failure forcing instinct-based flight. The Grandmother Canopy and arrow-in-fissure create the final transformative image. Vivid sensory work: "mist pooled like liquid memory," "petals swirling in slow, silent cyclones."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding resilience) progresses through discovery of the arrow, its growth-acceleration reveal, to the final understanding about memory/echoing. The gravity-inversion deadline creates genuine pressure. However, the physical stakes remain somewhat abstract—no clear cost if Elira fails beyond continued ignorance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that resilience comes from remembering trauma and triumph, not inherent strength. The arrow as "seed/catalyst" that "planted" rather than "pierced" offers resonant complexity. Final image of Elira echoing with the orchard beautifully reweights all prior navigation and listening imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression: "hung suspended in a nebula's sigh," "ghost-trails of dew." POV remains stable with consistent perceptual signature focused on navigation, flow, and resonance. Some register elevation in places ("capricious tide," "liquid compass needles") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally distances from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong poetic density with lines doing multiple jobs: "branches unrooted from earth and reached for the sky" conveys both action and metaphor. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "It sang...It echoed" sequence and the extended "Waiting for" repetition. Some fragments like "Warm. Thrumming." work rhythmically but accumulate slightly past optimal density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi and mystical elements through specific details: gravity inversion as navigation window, bio-harmonic convergence, memory stored in landscape. The concept of resilience-through-remembering rather than strength is non-obvious and earned. Risk-taking with the lyrical accumulative structure and "whirling silence" paradox heightens meaning (+0.3).</comment>
