<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from metallic city noise to understanding "emergent hush" is well-motivated with concrete embodied details (fingers tracing spirals, mist curling around ankles). The final choice to witness rather than fix brokenness lands with earned cost through prior exploration, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("lilac unease" recurs without deeper embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the rain-watching scene where the artist applies her grotto lesson to everyday perception (musician's yearning beneath off-key notes). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through whisper harmonization to final recognition, with cost visible in the cracked tile flake and abandoned mandala.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as active setting that constrains and enables discovery through its acoustic properties ("emergent hush" phenomenon, walls absorbing/returning sound). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet limestone scent, mist texture), though some descriptions lean abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on the artist's need to escape metallic city noise and find meaning, with escalation through the mandala's whisper revelation forcing her to confront absorbed but unprocessed voices. The cost manifests in the cracked tile and abandoned mandala, though the internal conflict could sharpen further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the concrete discovery that "meaning emerges not when noise ceases, but when we learn to listen through patterns we ourselves create." The final rain-watching scene offers a non-literal answer about witnessing brokenness rather than fixing it, avoiding explicit moralizing while maintaining resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature (reading crowds like weather maps, sounds tasting metallic). Some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") that occasionally distance from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density but suffers from recurring abstract phrases ("lilac unease" appears twice, "emergent hush" multiple times) and occasional overwriting in figurative language. The mandala sequence maintains good momentum despite density, though some sentences could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of discovering meaning through listening to self-created patterns offers a fresh angle on artistic process and urban overwhelm. The whispering gallery tile as stolen cathedral fragment adds specificity, though the "unlearning" frame feels somewhat derivative of workshop language.</comment>
