<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The historian's motivation to preserve memory against entropy is clear and consistent, with her "sensitively perceptive" nature manifesting through concrete actions like feeling which pages "trembled with suppressed truth." Her discovery progression from diaries to tapestry to the underlibrary creates genuine escalation. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("letting its silent mythos anchor her") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the historian commits to "weave with testimony." The displaced axis concept effectively constrains the world and drives discovery. Deduction for slightly abstract cost—while the commitment to descend and weave is clear, the price remains more conceptual than visceral at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The silo library setting actively shapes investigation through its architecture (hearthstone hiding diaries) and its walls that "hum with memory." Sensory details like "bronze lamp whose glow pooled like liquid metal" and tactile exploration of books create atmosphere. The underlibrary promise adds spatial stakes. Strong integration of setting as both container and participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting stories to understanding the displaced axis to actively mending reality's wound. The discovery sequence (diaries→tapestry connection→wall memories) creates meaningful deepening. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition or cost—the historian faces no obstacles or trade-offs in her discoveries, making the escalation feel frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, entropy, and repair without explicit moralizing. The dragons-as-weavers metaphor enriches rather than dominates. The final image of weaving "with testimony" resonantly answers the question of how to preserve meaning after civilization's end. Minor deduction for the slightly pat revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("silence grew teeth," "walls smiled back") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature—focusing on textures, whispers, and material decay—fits the historian character. Some register elevation in places ("bronze quiet of the silo deepened") that slightly strains the established voice but doesn't break it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("shadow between bookshelves," "spines split open like ribs after autopsy"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tilted doorframes that no carpenter could fix") and some repetitive structures in the discovery sequence that create mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a post-human archivist discovering reality's wound through medieval tapestry offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of dragons-as-reality-menders with the historian's testimonial weaving feels earned. Slight deduction for the convenience of perfectly aligned discoveries, but the overall vision coheres uniquely.</comment>
