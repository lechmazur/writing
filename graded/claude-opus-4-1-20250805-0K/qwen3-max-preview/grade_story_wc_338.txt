<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's methodical curiosity and visceral motivation (grandmother's lost maps) compel her investigation with consistent embodied details like "fingertips brushing the damp stone." The final choice to leave yarrow as a "cartographer's token" shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("silence was not void but vessel") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition driving the closure—the shadow's choreographed spiral reveals the chapel's negative space. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as she witnesses the "whispered chapel" through accumulated video evidence, with clear emotional cost ("wept...from recognition"). Orientation anchors (vault, henge, fresco) establish early and the pattern-teaching through video analysis pays off at sunset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and weeping condensation create atmospheric pressure while the "map's deliberate tear" functions as micro-setting constraining her investigation. The shadow's migration across menhirs and its final pooling at sunset directly enables the chapel's revelation. Environment actively shapes the discovery through light, stone alignment, and temporal choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on interpreting "silence as vessel" rather than filling gaps, established early through grandmother's lost villages. The seventeen video clips create escalating pressure as the shadow's spiral pattern emerges, forcing her to witness rather than rebuild. The cost lands in her tears of recognition and the torn map she leaves unrepaired—acceptance over conquest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of absence/presence, with the chapel existing as "negative space shaped by reverence." The yarrow token and studio loop offer non-literal answers about thresholds and collective memory. The final image of the chapel "breathing—invisibly, audibly, eternally" resonates without moralizing, reweighting earlier silence as active testimony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "cartographic wound" and "silence, she believed, was not void but vessel" maintains consistent scholarly-poetic register. Some elevated diction ("fresco vault," "liturgical scrolls") fits the character's expertise. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract phrasing that slightly distances from immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("each droplet a metronome marking the slow collapse of memory into moss"). Some synonym loops around silence/absence/void concepts and occasional abstract phrasing ("shielded openness, heart unarmored yet guarded") create minor drag. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of discovering a chapel through shadow choreography across decades of footage offers genuine freshness. The transformation of cartographic methodology into spiritual witness elevates familiar archaeological discovery tropes. The specific synthesis of video analysis, henge alignment, and negative space as presence creates an inevitable-feeling revelation.</comment>
