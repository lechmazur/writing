<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma responses ("flinches," "breath held too long," "knees locked") create authentic interiority. The protagonist's transformation from "Subject Theta" to mathematical seeker is earned through visceral detail. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophizing about mercy that could be more grounded in specific memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the mathematics of mercy shifts from external equation to "space to be inhabited." Cost is legible in the pewter strap's dissolution and the protagonist's shift from "bracing" to "presence." The forest's response to pain creates coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as more than setting—it responds to trauma, creates paths based on pain resonance, and constrains movement through its spectral properties. Sensory hierarchy privileges pain-based perception ("wavelengths only the wounded could see"). The clearing's mathematical symbols charge the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from physical escape to navigating by trauma-compass to discovering mercy's mathematics. The protagonist's agency drives each deepening, particularly the choice to offer the pewter strap. Cost is visible in releasing the mask's last remnant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete mathematics metaphor—mercy as topology rather than arithmetic. The ending reweights trauma from pure suffering into "testimony becomes transformation" without moralizing. Subtext operates through the forest's responses and the interrogation memories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines trauma-filtered perception with mathematical language ("derivative of mercy," "asymptote of a withheld blow"). Controlled modulation from clinical detachment to emotional presence. Minor repetition of "braced" works as pattern but could vary more.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative coherence with the mathematical/geometric imagery threading throughout. Some elevated diction ("manifold," "asymptote") fits the concept but occasionally strains. Template repetition in "I braced" and slight overuse of abstract philosophizing about mercy lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mathematics-of-mercy concept offers fresh synthesis—interrogation trauma transformed into compassion topology. The proprioceptive enhancement as survival mechanism rather than design adds originality. Slightly derivative trauma-survivor framework prevents higher score.</comment>
