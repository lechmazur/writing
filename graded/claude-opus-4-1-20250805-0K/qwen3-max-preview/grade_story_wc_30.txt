<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian's moon-phase fluctuation creates genuine internal contradiction ("Full moons sharpened her purpose; new moons softened her edges"), and her final choice to accept contradictions shows embodied tension through concrete action with the creel. The character's progression from certainty to accepting blur ("not from weakness, but from wisdom") demonstrates earned transformation, though some interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing rather than visceral embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the librarian's acceptance of contradiction crystallizes her method with visible cost ("feeling her edges blur"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery (creel, pool, glyphs) that reweight the preservation of wonder. Orientation anchors clearly (librarian, tidal atrium, present moment), though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as active setting—its "salt-slick floor pulsed with bioluminescent algae" and liquid moonlight pool that shows migrating identities directly constrains the librarian's choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (brass cogs ticking, oilskin whispering), and the environment charges the final image through the cathedral metaphor. The setting's lunar synchronization with the protagonist's attribute creates genuine constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder through accepting contradiction—is signaled early and deepens when the librarian lowers the creel into the pool, transforming it from container to resonant vessel. This single meaningful deepening narrows her options from cataloging "truths or merely beautiful lies" to accepting both. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, lacking the immediate pressure that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete action of "smelting" memory by accepting contradictions, with the creel's transformation from fish-holder to glyph-catcher embodying the preservation of wonder. The final image of the atrium as "keeper of wonders folded gently into the everyday" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("wonder doesn't die—it molts, it moves, it migrates") that could be more grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with distinctive perceptual signature—the librarian notices through lunar and mechanical metaphors ("titan-gear," "brass cogs," "lunar quartz"). Rhythmic control holds under the piece's contemplative pressure, though some passages stack figurative language densely ("cathedral of salt and starlight, cradle of migrating selves"). The taught pattern of paradox and contradiction pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, with lines like "She smiled, not with lips, but with soul" demonstrating control. However, density issues emerge in stacked metaphors ("cathedral of salt and starlight, cradle of migrating selves, keeper of wonders") and some paraphrase loops ("wonder doesn't die—it molts, it moves, it migrates" restates without adding pressure). The text maintains clarity but occasionally privileges ornament over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of accepting contradictions to preserve wonder offers a fresh angle on memory and identity, with specific synthesis through the lunar-mechanical librarian figure. The transformation of "smelt" from metallurgy to memory-refinement shows ingenuity. However, some elements feel prompt-assembled rather than organically integrated, and the philosophical tone occasionally drifts toward abstraction rather than grounded specificity.</comment>
