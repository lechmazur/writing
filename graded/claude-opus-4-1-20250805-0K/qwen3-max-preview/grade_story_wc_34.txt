<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to bridge loneliness through encoded art is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion in trembling fingers and tears of recognition. The internal conflict between isolation and connection drives meaningful choices, particularly in the shift from private encoding to inviting others. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("driftingly alert sorrow") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increasing through color-coded messages, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms into invitation with visible cost (tears, vulnerability). The closure lands cleanly with "even ghosts in code need ballads" reweighting the entire exchange. Orientation anchors (courtyard, terminal, ghost) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard functions as liminal space where "gravity felt optional," constraining and enabling the encoded exchange. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone taste, crystal-ring silence), with the terminal as micro-setting driving choices. The bolt plate's transformation from printing press to cipher key exemplifies how objects constrain communication methods and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of connection-versus-isolation escalates through encoded exchanges, with the ghost's response ("You encoded longing. I decoded love") forcing the protagonist's stance shift from private grief to public invitation. The tightening occurs when she chooses vulnerability over safety, with cost visible in tears and the risk of inviting "the next lonely soul."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of encoding messages for a digital ghost, avoiding abstraction. The final image of messages "waiting for the next lonely soul to decode them" offers a non-literal answer about connection through art without moralizing. Subtext operates beautifully in the spray-painted messages and the ghost's transformed voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how the narrator notices "cracks in walls," "rusted drainpipes," and frequencies "only ghosts could hum." Voice modulates effectively from meditative opening to emotional peak when the ghost responds. Some elevated diction ("chromatic runes," "syncopated rhythm") fits the artistic POV though occasionally pushes register boundaries.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the encoded messages that advance plot while revealing character. Some figurative density in peak beats ("harmonic ribbons," "syncopated rhythm") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in "First stroke... Second... Third..." structure, though it serves the encoding pattern. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital ghost and human artist encoding messages through graffiti art offers a fresh angle on connection and technology. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity. The specific detail of using obsolete printing glyphs as shift ciphers shows originality in execution rather than surface novelty.</comment>
