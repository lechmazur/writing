I'll evaluate this story through the lens of literary fiction intended for prestigious publication, applying the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation, repeated transactions, and density increase rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation to "unwrite herself" drives consistent choices through measured transactions. Her internal contradiction between helping others erase while carrying her own void creates authentic tension, particularly in "each sale a mirror, each customer a reflection of the void she carried." The micro-choices of incising marks and recording absences reveal character through action, though some interiority relies on abstract declaration rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the vendor achieves Earned Stasis through distributing weight rather than erasing it - "she had learned to distribute its weight—parcel it out in measured doses, trade it for other people's hollows." The accumulative lens holds as seven transactions build density toward this realization. Cost is visible in the ledger's arithmetic of loss and the vendor's ongoing burden, though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library setting actively constrains and enables choices - bottles must be drunk "beneath a tree whose name you've forgotten," shelves shift "like tectonic plates of narrative." The crystalline environment mirrors the story's themes of transparency and fragmentation. Sensory details like "air smelled of ozone and unread epilogues" create atmosphere while the "clouds below churned, slow and syrupy" grounds the fantastical in tactile imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake - the vendor's need to manage her own erasure through helping others - accumulates through seven transactions that deepen understanding. Each sale reveals more about the weight she carries, building to her realization about distribution versus elimination. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment; transactions proceed without complication or meaningful resistance that would heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the paradox of measuring absence to create presence - "Choose your emptiness. It's the shape of your next beginning." The recurring imagery of gleaming incisions that refract rather than bleed creates resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. The final insight about distributing rather than eliminating burden offers complexity, though the piece occasionally veers toward abstract philosophizing in lines like "the place where stories begin."]</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density - "her cart rattling with unlabeled wares and half-remembered promises." The vendor's perceptual signature focuses on measurement and quantification fitting her role. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, as in the distinction between "absolution" and "the method: by quantifying absence," though some passages drift into elevated diction that strains against the intimate POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. Information density is high - most sentences advance both literal and thematic work. However, some abstract noun clusters like "glimmering parole" and "conditional release from the weight of memory" create opacity. The repeated "She [verb]" structure in the closing sequence creates mild template cadence that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a vendor selling erasure through "bottled moonlight" that reveals absence rather than presence offers genuine freshness. The specific arithmetic of loss ("3.7 heartbeats of regret, 12 grams of unsaid words") transforms familiar themes of memory and regret. The synthesis of commerce and catharsis through measured transactions feels both surprising and inevitable, elevated by risk-taking in the fantastical setting.</comment>
