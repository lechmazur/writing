<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's investigative mindset and methodical approach create a consistent, specific character with clear motivation to prevent future disasters. Internal conflict between scientific detachment and personal connection (Varga's patch) operates simultaneously in scene. The final choice to step into the wind's path with purposeful exposure represents earned agency, though the cost could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves Charged Poise closure where the narrator crystallizes their stance against an adaptive threat, with the patch as compass and the wind as learner creating undeniable pressure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of wind behaviors building to the confrontational ending. Cost is felt through Varga's death and the isolation of being the sole person who understands the danger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The port's container labyrinth functions as active antagonist, teaching wind to ambush through its geometry. Sensory detail filters through the investigator's professional lens (wind gauges, pressure gradients, thermal differentials). The environment directly constrains choices and creates the central threat, with the final image of stepping into the wind's path impossible without this specific maze-like setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating past disaster to predicting/preventing the next convergence point within six hours. The tightening occurs through discovery that repositioning the crane "only changed its shape" of danger. Agency manifests in the choice to map danger despite isolation, though the immediate physical cost could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wind that "learns" and "rapidly adapts," creating resonant commentary on systems that evolve beyond human prediction. Varga's insight "It's not the wind. It's the way the wind learns" pays off in the narrator's final stance. The ending offers a non-literal answer about confronting adaptive threats through patient observation rather than reactive fixes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through investigator's technical lens ("thermal differentials," "singular convergence"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to personal stake when touching the patch. The controlled technical register maintains consistency even under pressure, with syntax reflecting the methodical mind of the focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and technical understanding). Strong verb choices and varied sentence structures create natural rhythm. Minor repetition of "wind" could be varied, but prose remains clean and propulsive throughout with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of wind learning through architecture offers a fresh angle on accident investigation. The specific synthesis of technical investigation with environmental adaptation feels earned. While port settings aren't novel, the treatment of containers as wind teachers and the investigator's solitary expertise create memorable specificity.</comment>
