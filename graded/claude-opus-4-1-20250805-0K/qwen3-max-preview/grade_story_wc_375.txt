<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal contradiction between suppressed creativity and the need to express drives genuine character tension. The final choice to draw and release carries visible emotional cost through tears and the father's lingering portrait. Embodied emotion through charcoal-stained fingers and physical reactions to the cave elevates beyond mere labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through layered memories and portraits materializing on cave walls, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where releasing the portraits transforms both artist and cave. Cost is visible through tears, the broken lock, and the father's softened expression. The childhood charcoal discovery provides causal linkage to the final act of drawing-to-release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cave functions as more than setting—its auroral glow mirrors emotional states and its formation history ("carved by water that refused to be contained") constrains the protagonist's choice to finally uncork. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, focusing on crystal textures and light rather than tourist description. The cave's transformation from sorrow to dawn-warmth tracks with character arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of creative suppression versus expression signals early and tightens when the lock rattles in resonance with the cave's own imprisonment history. The discovery of the hidden charcoal escalates options, forcing the choice between continued suppression or release. Cost is legible through the portraits' dissolution and the father's final softening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the lock that "refuses to turn" but needs to "witness," the cave shaped by pressures demanding release. The ending reweights all prior suppression through the act of drawing wings on portraits to set them free, avoiding stated morals. The father's tear drawn by the daughter complexifies forgiveness without false redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through artistic lens—seeing faces as "graphite into soul-deep contours" and memories as "tombstones." Voice maintains lyric elevation consistently without head-hopping. Some register elevation ("auroral sorrow," "mnemonically sovereign") pushes against naturalism but serves the piece's heightened emotional register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but elevated diction occasionally obscures ("mnemonically sovereign," "resonance") and some metaphor mixing occurs ("memories like tombstones" shifts to "flood" to "uncork"). Template phrasing appears in "She remembers...She spent years...She needs it to" construction. No major loops but rhythmic monotony in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of artistic suppression with cave-as-prison offers a non-obvious angle, particularly the lock that needs to witness rather than open. The specific detail of charcoal-stained fingers as permanent mark of calling elevates beyond generic artist story. Final transformation where drawing becomes release rather than capture inverts expectation.</comment>
