<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand night-blooming flowers drives consistent action from pavilion to cathedral and back, with embodied grief ("she wept...from the quiet thunder of understanding"). However, she lacks internal contradiction during key moments—her quest proceeds without meaningful doubt or competing impulses, and the epiphany arrives too cleanly without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure—the artist discovers encoded nocturnal flowers in cathedral glass, then returns to paint her own night-blooming mural. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she accepts mystery over solution ("still reckons—not to solve, but to surrender"). Cost is visible in her transformation from seeker to keeper of secrets, though the journey-return structure feels somewhat mechanical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity ("turpentine and dried lavender," "stone floor like half-remembered dreams") with the cathedral glass functioning as constraining micro-setting that shapes her investigation method. The amber pavilion bookends effectively but doesn't pressure choices beyond providing workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding night-blooming flowers—progresses through discovery of hidden glass layers, but escalation plateaus after the cathedral revelation. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or trade-offs; her quest succeeds without forcing difficult choices or visible prices beyond time spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the parallel between hidden glass flowers and actual night-blooming plants—"beauty persists in obscurity." The final image of the artist watching real flowers while visitors miss the mural's meaning creates resonant layers without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("slush turning to mud beneath her boots, icicles weeping from eaves") and consistent perceptual signature focused on visual artistry and botanical detail. The prose maintains elevated register appropriately for an artist-protagonist without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong imagery, but repetitive structural patterns emerge ("She still carries...She still kneels...She still reckons"). Some purple prose in peak moments ("umbral tenderness of night") and the extended ending creates mild momentum drag despite lyric intention.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of artistic detective work with botanical mysticism offers a fresh angle, particularly the encoded cathedral glass revealing centuries of night-flower worship. The transformation from investigator to initiated keeper of secrets provides genuine surprise while maintaining coherence.</comment>
