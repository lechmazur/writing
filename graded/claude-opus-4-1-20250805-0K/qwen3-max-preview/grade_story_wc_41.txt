<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet's precognitive forgetting creates genuine internal contradiction—remembering futures that dissolve, leaving only sensory traces. His ritual actions reveal character through embodied grief (weeping at unrecognized tunes) and the poignant detail of chalk worn down by sounds he can't recall. The closure choice to walk backward preserves the markers despite forgetting, showing earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory ghosts until the prophet finally captures "the sound of growing older"—a tidal, rhythmic longing. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: he accepts perpetual forgetting while maintaining his ritual, with cost visible in trembling body and erasure by dew. The fog reshaping into rocking chair/swing set/nothing crystallizes impermanence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden functions as active setting—fog sculpts "phantom limbs and half-remembered faces," growing "echoes" instead of flowers. Driftwood arrangements triangulate "grief's echo" and "nostalgia's pull," constraining the prophet's search method. The junkyard's videotape towers create claustrophobic temporal weight. Sensory hierarchy reflects the prophet's unique perception of sound-as-lure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—locating the sound of aging—tightens through ritual precision with driftwood pointing toward specific tapes, culminating in the discovered sound beneath chalk's screech. Cost is legible in physical trembling and immediate forgetting. However, escalation remains somewhat static as the prophet's agency is limited to repetitive searching rather than adapting tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of memory's persistence despite forgetting—driftwood remains, chalk returns, fog faithfully sculpts grief. The final image of chalk "half-buried, humming faintly" resonates as "the last echo of a man who remembered futures, but lived only in the sound of what slips away." Subtext operates through objects: chalk as tuning fork, tapes as tombstones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic description ("taste of static," "sound of time thickening"). Voice modulates effectively from ritual precision to emotional overwhelm. Some register elevation in phrases like "gravity's patient siege" slightly strains the prophet's voice, though the lyric mode largely justifies it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"junkyard prophet squatted in the fog sculpture garden" establishes character, setting, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("moon on wave," "breath on glass") approaches overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "He rose... He didn't know... Didn't know" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory loss with precognition creates original premise—forgetting futures rather than pasts. Specific details like chalk as sonic lure and fog sculpting echoes avoid generic treatment. The transformation of growing older from decay into "tidal" rhythm offers non-obvious insight.</comment>
