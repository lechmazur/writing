<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's internal contradiction between fury and tranquility manifests through concrete actions (measuring time, concealing poems, choosing not to open the envelope), with the final renunciation of opening carrying visible emotional cost. The "furiously tranquil" state embodies throughout rather than being merely labeled, though some passages drift toward abstract reflection without immediate embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through storm imagery, timer clicks, and the sealed envelope, culminating in Earned Stasis where the poet chooses not to open the letter—a renunciation with felt cost ("the silence was enough"). Orientation anchors clearly (observatory, poet, storm), but the closure's cost could be more visceral; "became her own archive" gestures toward transformation without fully dramatizing the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-lit observatory functions as more than backdrop—lightning illuminates key moments, the storm's crescendo mirrors internal tension, and the darkroom timer constrains the ritual's rhythm. The sealed envelope hidden in the bus timetable creates specific texture, though some descriptive passages ("clouds churned like ink in milk") lean ornamental rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether to break the vigil by opening the envelope, with pressure accumulating through storm intensification and the timer reaching zero, forcing the choice to maintain sacred silence. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—"honoring the question" over seeking answers—which fits the reflective mode but lacks the immediate price that would elevate beyond mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cartography metaphor transforms from wounds/scars to waypoints/coordinates, reweighting censorship from loss to navigation ("each one mapped a place she'd survived"). The final image of becoming "her own unredacted sky" resonates without stating a moral, though phrases like "storm-kissed wonder" occasionally gesture toward theme rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The elevated register ("furiously tranquil," "cartography of wounds") maintains consistency with the poet-narrator's interiority, and syntactic variety creates rhythm matching emotional intensity. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("oracle of ink and bone"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("She knew now," "She understood").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers, but abstract passages like "to rarefy was to refine pain until it gleamed" create paraphrase loops that explain rather than dramatize. Template structures appear ("She had not come to chart stars, but scars") alongside some overwrought metaphors, though the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The censored poet finding agency through cartographic reframing offers a fresh angle on artistic suppression, avoiding simple victim narratives. The specific detail of hiding poems in bus timetables and the "furiously tranquil" emotional state create originality, though the storm-as-emotion parallel and some philosophical passages ("some truths must ferment") lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
