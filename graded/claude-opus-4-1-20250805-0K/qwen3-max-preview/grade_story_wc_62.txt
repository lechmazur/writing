<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's meditation manifests through visceral craft details and the spectral mentorship creates genuine tension between solitude and connection. The final choice to continue carving "not alone" carries earned emotional weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around grief's "geometry" that briefly pulls from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with ribbons accumulating meaning until the final crimson one triggers Silas stepping forward—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where isolation transforms to accompanied practice. Cost is felt through grandmother's memory loss and the weight of collective mourning. Slight deduction for the abstract "grief geometry" section that momentarily breaks texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as active setting—ribbons tied to rafters, butterflies against glass, moss-slicked stones all constrain and enable Elias's ritual. The migration timing creates natural pressure. Sensory selection (violet light, cool spectral hand, whispered poems) serves the meditative grief work perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: family poems → stranger epitaphs → final grandmother ribbon, with Silas's presence intensifying from distant watching to direct heart-touch. The butterfly migration provides external pressure. Cost is legible in accepting grief as "current to be joined" rather than void to fill, though the middle could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ribbons-as-loom metaphor and the butterfly migration echoing "souls departing." The final insight about grief as migration "carried on poems and chiseled letters" reweights all prior carving work. Slight deduction for one instance of explicit thematic statement about "collective grief" that could trust the imagery more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("bruised hues of twilight," "thundering calm") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature—seeing letters as vessels, feeling poems' weight—is character-specific. Minor repetition of "spectral" and some filter verbs ("he realized," "he believed") slightly dull immediacy in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("wings brushing panes like parchment against stone") with good rhythm variation. However, abstract passages about grief's "geometry" and "angles of absence" create momentary opacity. Some filter verb clustering mid-story ("realized," "believed," "began") dulls propulsion, though the ending recovers momentum well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The spectral mentorship as craft apprenticeship continuing after death offers fresh angle on grief narrative. The synthesis of gravestone carving with poetry trading creates original texture. The "thundering calm" paradox and butterflies as soul-migration avoid cliché through specific execution, though the grief-as-geometry concept feels slightly overwrought.</comment>
