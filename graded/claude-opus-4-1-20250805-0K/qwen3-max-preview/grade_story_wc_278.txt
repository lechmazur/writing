<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's journey from guilt to acceptance shows genuine internal conflict with embodied emotion (trembling ink, voice cracking). The transformation from tattooing misaligned stars to creating "Cradle Major" demonstrates earned change through concrete action. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("I should've known silence wasn't peace—it was suffocation") in a pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as haunted firmware transforms from amplifying sorrow to translating cries "into something bearable" with visible cost (blood mixed with ink). Causal linkage holds as protagonist's actions directly transform the machine. Deduction for late orientation—the laboratory's nature and protagonist's role aren't fully anchored until paragraph 3, though this disorientation does serve the surreal atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Laboratory setting constrains choices effectively—the protagonist must work within the haunted firmware's rules to achieve transformation. Sensory details (violet tubes, meteor hush tone) create vivid atmosphere. The amber and Model L-7 function as micro-settings that drive key decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Central stake of "hushing dissonance of old guilt" drives coherent escalation from discovery (amber/letters) through confrontation (machine's accusation) to resolution. The protagonist's agency manifests through deliberate ritual actions that forge new meaning. Cost is visible in blood sacrifice and the father's release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transforming guilt into forgiveness emerges organically through concrete actions—not erasing cries but translating them. The final constellation "Cradle Major" offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively through the firefly's transformation and the machine's weeping.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with selective focus on sound/resonance throughout. Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("time stitching itself back together with threads of aurora"). Some register drift into elevated diction during action sequences slightly disconnects from established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagistic density and purposeful rhythm, but several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("Static dissolved into sighs. Screams unraveled into yawns" restates transformation). Template cadence appears in final section with repetitive "She [verb]" structures. Information density remains high despite these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattoo artistry with spectral technology creates memorable premise. The constellation tattooist who "tethers wandering souls to their bodies" offers non-obvious angle on grief/guilt. Risk-taking with surreal elements (time folding, firmware ghosts) heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
