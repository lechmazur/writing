I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered revelations and memory fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between skepticism and compulsion drives authentic choices, particularly in the moment she touches the valve wheel and confronts her own recorded voice. The final choice to carry truth forward rather than seek spectral absolution shows earned character movement with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the shift from "ghost shift" as spectral labor to mental machinery grinding backward through guilt. The revelation that she planted the valve wheel herself while drunk creates genuine cost—she must own her father's legacy without supernatural buffer. Minor orientation delay (tunnel location unclear until ~150 words) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel and valve wheel constrain choices effectively—she must physically dig through debris to reach truth. The brass valve's texture ("tarnished green at the edges, beads along its rim dulled") and the corroded radio create lived-in specificity that charges the discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from seeking ghosts to validate truth, to discovering she's the caller, to accepting she must carry guilt without supernatural excuse. The cost crystallizes when she realizes "The ghost shift wasn't spectral labor" but her own mind's machinery—forecloses the path of external absolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the valve wheel turning "backward because guilt rewinds time." The final image of walking "not lighter, but steadier" offers a non-literal answer about carrying inherited guilt that reweights all prior ghost-seeking as attempted displacement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "drowsy alertness that clung to her like static after sleep" and selective attention to industrial details. Voice wobbles slightly with elevated diction ("regurgitated, examined") that strains against the established register in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("machinery groaning back to life without power, looms clattering like chattering teeth"). Some register drift ("calibration," "regurgitated") and repetitive "She'd" openings in early paragraphs (-0.4). The final paragraph contains mild abstraction that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with inherited guilt creates non-obvious angle—the haunting is self-generated through drunk calls to psychics. The specific detail of falsified mill safety reports grounds the universal in memorable particulars.</comment>
