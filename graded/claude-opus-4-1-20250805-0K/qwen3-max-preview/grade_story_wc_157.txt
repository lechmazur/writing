<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rogue scholar's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like planting linguistic payloads and humming dead syntax, with internal conflict between compliance performance and rebellion. The relationship with Dr. Vex creates a crucible moment when he recognizes his mother's lullaby and chooses alliance, altering the state of their resistance. Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about joining at sixteen rather than embodied revelation through present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the garden of resistance crystallizing options and the children singing old lullabies showing undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of collective defiance. Deduction for mild orientation delay (greenhouse purpose unclear initially) and some causality softness in how surveillance is evaded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choices through surveillance moths and humidity controls, with Dr. Vex's manipulation of these elements enabling the rebellion. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wet earth and pinned wings," "glass panes rattled"). The gourd vine's spatial patterns readable only at dawn with dew exemplifies environment charging meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual seed-planting to collective resistance as neighbors notice patterns and Dr. Vex joins, with meaningful deepening when the plan expands from one gourd to "a hundred small rebellions." The cost is somewhat abstract ("grammar of resistance") rather than viscerally felt on-page. Agency drives the escalation through the scholar's choices and Dr. Vex's decision to help.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of planting defiance as literal seeds, with the gourd rattle becoming a living transmitter for banned language. The final image of children singing lullabies offers a resonant answer about how resistance spreads through seemingly innocent acts. Subtext operates effectively in the comma-shaped beetle glyph and Dr. Vex's temple-tapping signal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct texture with inventive compounds ("chitinous observation and chlorophyll ambition") and consistent POV control. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("semantic insurgents," "cognitive smoothness"). The perceptual signature of noticing surveillance gaps and encoding messages in plant patterns is character-specific and well-sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several passages suffer from abstract telling ("standing guard over her spark of defiance") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. Template cadence appears in the ending's parallel structures ("Through the children... Through the librarians... Through the rogue scholar"). Prose maintains momentum despite these frictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of linguistic resistance through guerrilla gardening after thoughts become taxable offers genuine originality, transforming surveillance dystopia tropes through specific horticultural detail. The synthesis of entomology, horticulture, and language preservation feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the conceptual leap pays off with coherent world-building.</comment>
