<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's internal contradiction between selling certainty and harboring doubt creates genuine tension throughout, with the unhooking of the cloak serving as a powerful embodied choice that forecloses her old path. The "sincerely insincere" characterization drives the entire arc. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around vulnerability that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the cloak unhooking as a decisive change that reweights Elira's entire practice. Closure lands with clear cost—she'll lose clients but gain authenticity. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for the wind chimes' mechanical function being somewhat opaque initially.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choice effectively—the height, isolation, and wind all pressure the unhooking moment. Salt air, cold stone, and wind chimes create vivid sensory texture. The seashell at the end charges the final image. Some spatial choreography around the chimes' placement could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to shed false certainty—intensifies through the chimes' increasing insistence and the cloak's resistance. The unhooking forecloses her old professional path with clear cost: "if they walked away? So be it." One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard shows her true uncertain self rather than polished or might-have-been versions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of unhooking and the transformation from selling certainty to offering questions. The hollow mirror shard's shifting reflections embody the theme without stating it. The final seashell image resonates as benediction for her choice. Slight abstraction around "protected vulnerability" keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"salt and silence," "spark whisper into ash." The wind chimes' metallic language and Elira's interior texture remain distinct. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Minor register elevation in places ("benediction") slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most lines advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("protected vulnerability," "armor shed so softer truths could breathe") and occasional register drift reduce clarity in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire profession offering moral clarity while harboring doubt presents a fresh paradox. The wind chimes as wartime code transformed into personal revelation shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation from certainty-seller to question-offerer feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
