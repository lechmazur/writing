<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore sacred practices is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions through playing the flute and coaxing the Moonroot. The seventeen-year wait and her methodical preparation (tracing murals, decoding lullabies) establish credible commitment. However, internal conflict remains largely implicit—we see dedication but minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, which prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds density through layered musical imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the arbor transforms into living song. The closure lands with visible cost: generations of lost practice acknowledged through the apparitions' bow to earth. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words. The vine's transformation from tendril to wreath provides coherent arc under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arbor functions as more than backdrop—its humming memory, the oak's knot becoming a doorway, and roots tapping rhythm all constrain and enable Elara's actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dew, moss and machine oil, amber light). The vine tendril's physical transformation charges the final wreath image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early and pressure builds through the vine's response, the arbor's gathering hush, and the oak's question "Why did we stop singing?" The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from playing forgotten songs to enabling the land itself to remember. Cost is visible in the generational loss acknowledged, though agency remains somewhat passive (listening rather than deciding).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "progress and pragmatism" versus sacred practice, embodied in Elara's paradox of moss and machine oil. The final wreath image offers a non-literal answer about cyclical renewal without moralizing. The piece earns its wisdom through specific experience—seventeen years of preparation, decoding half-remembered hymns—rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's tinkerer lens: she perceives the vine as having a "heartbeat," reads the arbor's "memory," interprets natural responses as questions. POV remains stable in third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Prose rhythm modulates effectively, slowing during the hush and accelerating through the apparitions' emergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some elevated diction borders on purple ("velvet over stone," "latent music"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor issues: "spun golden stories" feels forced for the prompt element; some filter constructions ("She didn't force") could be more immediate. The closing image of the wreath as "sacred space—ready to be filled" lands effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of environmental magic and technological tinkering (brass goggles, copper pipes, clocktower gear) offers a fresh angle on restoration narrative. The specific seventeen-year preparation timeline and the arbor's memory as "creak of old wood remembering song" avoid generic mysticism. Risk-taking in the apparitional chorus could push harder but the execution remains coherent.</comment>
