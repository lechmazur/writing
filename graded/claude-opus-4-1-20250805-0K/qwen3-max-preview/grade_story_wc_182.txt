<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's linguist expertise meaningfully shapes her approach—she reads linguistic strata rather than titles, interprets Kael's "dislocated verbs," and understands rescue as semantic negotiation. Her careful resourcefulness manifests through patient questions over force, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction ("semantic blooms") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the library reveals itself as a teacher and the mountain "holds its breath" while knowledge chooses when to be found—a genuine Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (abandoning extraction for reconciliation). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the pattern of linguistic/botanical metaphors accumulates toward the diary-as-bridge moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore creates genuine spatial pressure through "shelves that spiraled into shadowed vaults," gravity that "stutters," and aisles that rearrange in response to understanding. The hollow shaped like an open codex effectively functions as micro-setting that enables the crucial diary-placement, though some descriptions remain abstract ("lacunae were doors").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from finding a library to understanding that rescue means reconciliation not extraction—a meaningful conceptual shift. The cost is legible: Kael's failed mission reframed, Elira becoming part of the library rather than finding it. However, the physical danger remains minimal and the transformation occurs through dialogue rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges beautifully through the central reversal: "rescue is not removal, but reconciliation" and "the unheard symphony needs conductors, not saviors." The botanical diary's semantic blooms mirror the library's teaching function, and the final image of knowledge "choosing when to be found" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through academic-poetic register ("fractured chronal signature," "semantic blooms," "syntax that bent causality") that remains consistent. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Neither are you, but the mountain collects strays"), though some passages drift toward abstraction without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gravity seemed to stutter," "footnotes dangled like ripe fruit") but occasional overwriting ("humming in the air like a tuning fork struck wrong"). Some abstract passages lack concrete anchoring, and metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in exposition-heavy middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of linguistics, botany, and time travel where a sentient lexicon teaches rather than needs rescue. The concept of "unlearned lessons" and gaps as doors shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking through the abstract conceptual framework pays off in the resonant ending (+0.3 within band).</comment>
