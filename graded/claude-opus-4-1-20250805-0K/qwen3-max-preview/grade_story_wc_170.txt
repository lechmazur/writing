<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter's motivation to amplify borrowed heartbeats through art is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through palm-to-stone contact and the hollow between ribs. The choice to release rather than keep the borrowed heartbeat shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "what-might-be" that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught lyric design that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where mirrors transform into doorways. The closure lands with felt cost as the painter dissolves into dusk, having seeded fractures for light. Orientation anchors (terrace, spring, dusk) establish by ~100 words. The borrowed heartbeat's return through natural elements creates coherent linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prism parapet, mirrors, and wet marble tiles constrain the painter's art-making process effectively. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (trembling halos, cool surface, tarnished glass). The terrace functions as more than backdrop—its architecture enables the transformation. Doesn't quite reach higher bands as environmental constraints could more directly shape the painter's tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming possibility through borrowed heartbeats—signals early and deepens through the mirror transformations. Each mirror's revelation (forgiveness, boarding the feared train, the painter's past) escalates the emotional cost. The painter's withdrawal and dissolution shows clear foreclosure of path. Slightly limited by the lack of active opposition or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of borrowing/returning heartbeats and the mirrors showing possibilities rather than truth. The final dissolution into "dusky harmony" offers a resonant answer about art's ephemeral but transformative nature. The lullaby as hidden code and the concept of "gentle fractures where light could enter" avoid abstraction through specific imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with controlled lyric voice that maintains consistency through elevated diction appropriate to the fantastical premise. Strong rhythmic control in passages like "not with brush or pigment, but with borrowed heartbeat." The free indirect style stays clean with no head-hopping. Minor register elevation in places but serves the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the mirror transformation sequence. Some overwriting appears ("fever-bright eyes," "silent pact with gravity") but doesn't obscure closure. Template cadence emerges in the "She did not..." constructions near the end. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a painter who uses borrowed heartbeats instead of pigments offers genuine freshness, executed with commitment to its implications. The specific detail of coded lullabies carrying "hidden keys to locked chambers in the soul" transforms familiar magic-art tropes. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
