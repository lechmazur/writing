<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to rediscover unburdened joy drives coherent choices from finding the fragment through creating the light installation, with internal contradiction between her "significant artist" persona and genuine creative delight. The final choice to return tomorrow "not to restore what was lost, but to paint new joys" shows earned transformation with visible cost (abandoning preservation for creation).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through oral histories, light-bending setup, and communal response, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira pockets the fragment as "no longer a relic, but a key." Cost is felt through her realization that she'd "buried [delight] beneath technique, acclaim, and the pressure to be 'significant'" though the exact price of this shift could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard setting constrains choices (fog as emulsion, architectural remains as scaffolding points) and enables the light installation through "fractured dome open to sky." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from fragment discovery through elder visits to courtyard transformation, with fog acting as both obstacle and medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of rediscovering authentic creative joy escalates from fragment discovery through elder testimonies to the courtyard installation, with meaningful deepening when "the child's smile bloomed across the courtyard walls." The tightening moment arrives when observers respond viscerally, forcing Elira to confront her buried motivations, though agency could be stronger in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of preservation into creation, with the fresco fragment shifting from relic to key. The final image of fog curling "like a contented cat" while carrying "the echo of children's feet" offers resonant answer to the question of how lost joy returns—not through restoration but through new creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges in phrases like "reading braille left by forgotten hands" and technical precision around light manipulation. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical observation to concrete action, though some passages drift into elevated register ("reverent, humming with color only the heart could see") that strains against the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several template constructions weaken momentum: "She visited...she sat with" parallel structure, abstract phrases like "emotional gravity" and "resonance." The prose occasionally reaches for elevated diction that creates distance rather than immediacy, particularly in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of light art with memory archaeology offers fresh angle on artistic purpose, with specific details like "mixing pigments with honeyed cider" grounding the concept. The transformation from preservation to creation-as-rediscovery provides non-obvious resolution, though some elements (fog as mystical barrier, ruins as canvas) lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
