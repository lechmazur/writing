<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from dock worker to soul-mender is earned through concrete mystical experience, with her internal resistance ("didn't believe in magic") giving way to embodied revelation. The whale's call forcing her to confront her armored past creates genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "mend souls" that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira transforms from hauling cargo to carrying hope, with visible cost in dissolving the scrimshaw and accepting a harder path. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and mythic elements build toward her transformation. Orientation anchors (sublittoral fringe, post-violence world) establish setting efficiently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and bioluminescent kelp create a liminal space that mirrors the story's threshold crossing. The disappearing island's mechanics (receding with cruelty, rising with compassion) directly constrain the story's logic. The physical journey into water becomes increasingly tactile ("cold as regret," "heavy as silence") charging the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal doubt through mystical summons to accepting a harder vocation of healing others. The whale's call creates the decisive pressure point that forces Lira's transformation. Cost is visible in the scrimshaw dissolving and her accepting vulnerability ("softer now in the spaces between sinew and soul").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire narrative through Lira's transformed touch carrying "the whale's echo" to others. Theme emerges organically from the island's mechanics (compassion makes land rise) and Lira's journey from isolation to connection. The final image of "grace no longer armor, but invitation" crystallizes the thematic transformation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression ("after violence became impossible") and mythic register. POV remains stable with Lira throughout, with perceptual shifts reflecting her transformation. Some elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "seismic") fits the mythic tone though occasionally strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, particularly in water immersion sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("mend souls," "carry hope") and some register elevation that could be more grounded. The prose serves the mythic tone but sometimes reaches for effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dock worker becoming mystical healer through whale-song and dissolving scrimshaw creates non-obvious transformation. The post-violence world where "violence became impossible" offers original frame. The specific detail of touch carrying whale's echo and widow's sail holding longer elevates beyond template transformation.</comment>
