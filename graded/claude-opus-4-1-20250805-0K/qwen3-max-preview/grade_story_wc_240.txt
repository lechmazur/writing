<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to understand letting go through her mother's disappearance is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (offering the laser pointer, not naming the figures). The internal contradiction between holding and releasing plays out in scene through her interaction with the familiar stranger. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "letting go" that edges toward therapy-speak, though it's mostly grounded in spatial metaphors and specific actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris transforms from hunting breaches to facilitating departures, with visible cost as the stranger dissolves into the soil. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final reweighting of her role. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "permissions" and "expansion" in the final lines, though the cost is felt through the dissolution scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm functions as more than setting—the caps respond to dimensional activity and their soil absorbs the dissolved stranger, making environment integral to the closure. Spatial details are vivid and POV-filtered through Aris's gift. Deduction for some vague anchoring of the greenhouse location and the abstract nature of "dimensional thresholds."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding how to let go of her mother—escalates from sensing to offering to witnessing dissolution, with the cost visible as the stranger becomes "motes of bioluminescent dust." The pressure builds through Aris's approach to the eastern trellis and crystallizes in the offering moment. Some abstract phrasing around "alignment" and "permeability" slightly dulls the visceral impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of letting go as "expansion through permeable barriers" emerges organically through the mushroom farm's function, the dimensional work, and the final transformation. The laser pointer transforms from dead relic to "key" that unlocks permissions rather than doors. Minor deduction for the slightly over-explicit thematic statement about "physics of letting go" in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Aris experiencing space as "curvature of rooms that didn't exist" and "pressure gradients of thresholds." The lyrical voice maintains consistency through spatial metaphors. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("quiet wildfire of pre-dawn understanding") and some abstract constructions that don't fully match the otherwise grounded voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "caps pulsing like slow heartbeats" and effective rhythm variation. However, several abstract constructions dilute momentum ("allowing the self to become permeable," "permissions," "act of expansion") and there's repetition around "letting go" concepts. The filtering through Aris's spatial gift creates unique phrasing but occasionally becomes overwrought.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of dimensional detection work with grief processing through mycological anchors is fresh and specific. The familiar strangers as peripheral figures who "had also let go—and failed" adds complexity. The transformation from intrusion specialist to departure facilitator is earned, though some elements (quantum particulates in soil) feel slightly convenient.</comment>
