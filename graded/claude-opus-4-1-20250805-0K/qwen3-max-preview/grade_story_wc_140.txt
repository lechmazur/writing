I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, using the Accumulative/Textural lens that best fits this lyric, fragment-collecting narrative.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve erased histories through collected fragments is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like his satchel of overheard stories. The character's filtered perception and methodical scavenging create a coherent worldview. Minor deduction for some abstract moments ("texture—the grit beneath memory's skin") that edge toward label-speak rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure through Charged Poise—Elias commits to endless collection "Until the tide took him—or until the world admitted he'd never died at all," with visible cost in his isolation and bureaucratic erasure. The accumulative structure coheres well as fragments layer into meaning. The orientation anchors (port, containers, Elias's status) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The port's shipping containers function as both physical maze and metaphorical tombstones, with tides dictating rhythm and forcing vertical movement—environment actively constrains choices. Sensory specificity excels: "salt-stung silence between waves," "rust and rivets," "mist clung to cranes like shrouds." The child's shoe moment particularly resonates, where setting generates ritual behavior.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving erased histories against bureaucratic forgetting—intensifies through accumulation rather than reversal. The child's shoe sequence deepens pressure effectively, and the tension between Elias's official death and continued collecting creates sustained conflict. Cost is visible in his isolation and the physical constraints of tides, though could be sharper at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the texture metaphor—lives persist not in names but in "the scrape of a boot on wet metal, the catch in a breath before a lie." The poison label transforms from death marker to "silent sentinel" against erasure. The ending reweights all collected fragments as a "counter-narrative" without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric rhythm and purposeful repetition ("He would keep collecting. He would keep layering."). The perceptual signature—reality "filtered" and "layered"—maintains consistency throughout. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("counter-narrative, one overheard sigh at a time") fits the meditative tone without breaking character perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph lengths creating visual texture. Excellent specificity in "Container 7-Alpha" and sensory details. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("texture—the grit beneath memory's skin") and some synonym repetition around "fragments/whispers/murmurs" that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a bureaucratically dead person archiving other erased lives offers genuine freshness. The filtered reality perception and fragment-collecting method create memorable specificity. The transformation of poison label from death marker to compass for finding erased histories shows creative reweighting of familiar elements.</comment>
