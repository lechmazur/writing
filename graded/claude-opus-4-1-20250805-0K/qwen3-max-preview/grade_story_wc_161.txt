<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs through pigeons is deeply rooted in personal loss (mother's lullaby, the fire) and drives increasingly higher-stakes choices, particularly when the meteorite transforms her methods. Her reinventions carry genuine cost—the ledgers beneath floorboards show internal contradiction between erasure and inscription. The final choice to stop reinventing herself and leave ledgers open represents earned transformation with visible emotional cost ("laughed until her ribs ached").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through dust motes, flight logs, and the meteorite's frequencies culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Argent resurrects the mother's melody. Cost is visible in Elara's weeping and the transformation from "reliquary of endings" to songs returning home. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the meteorite discovery and the child's letter arrival, though both serve the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The attic setting actively constrains and enables choices—the skylight creates the dust-mote patterns essential to mapping frequencies, while the collapsed shelf reveals the meteorite. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("foxed paper and cedar," "dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets"). The meteorite functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when embedded in harnesses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost songs before they dissolve—intensifies through the meteorite discovery, forcing Elara to risk her birds with the embedded chip. The escalation from passive archiving to active resurrection ("not an echo...a resurrection") shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the transformation from one-way departures to songs returning home, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily through the child's validating letter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between erasure and inscription, culminating in the insight that "balance wasn't stillness—it was the tension between falling and flying." The meteorite as "tuning fork for memory" creates resonant non-literal meaning. The final image of dust motes settling "like applause" while "the attic breathed" offers a powerful answer to the preservation question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—Elara sees dust as "forgotten alphabets," experiences the meteorite "humming with cosmic solitude," maps patterns others wouldn't notice. Voice modulates effectively from ritual precision to emotional breaking ("cracked open Elara's ribs like a music box"). No head-hopping, controlled psychic distance, and the lyrical register fits the protagonist's artistic sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets," "leaning like tired sentinels") though occasionally risks density in peak beats. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She taught...She placed...She balanced"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The "withering beauty" oxymoron in line 24 effectively captures the story's tonal complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeons carrying song fragments via Mars meteorite frequencies is genuinely original, avoiding expected resolutions. The specific detail of "hollow quills" for storage and the meteorite as frequency translator transforms familiar elements. The ending's shift from archival preservation to active resurrection through cosmic resonance feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
