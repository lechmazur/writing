<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation through chemical incantations and the kerosene rag knot creates consistent character-specific detail, with her final choice to lay down the talisman earning its cost through prior buildup. The protagonist's shift from "controlled chaos" to "serious playfulness" shows genuine transformation, though some internal states lean toward abstraction ("defying gravity" lacks embodied specificity in middle beats).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mosaic dance sequence builds through accumulative pressure to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the star's appearance crystallizes Lira's defiance with clear cost (sacrificing her kerosene talisman). The textural lens holds consistently through sensory accumulation and harmonic resonance, with the final "spark takes root—not in sky, but in soul" reweighting the journey's meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blooming fortress with its "petals that curl from mortar cracks like slow-burning fuses" creates a setting that both mirrors Lira's pyrotechnic past and constrains her path through shadow-triggered flowers and harmonic tiles. The mosaic chamber's specific mechanics (each tile's frequency, the suspended dust constellation) directly enable the closure, though some middle passages drift toward catalog description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of reclaiming joy against hopelessness escalates through the mosaic dance where each step raises energetic pressure culminating in the star's appearance—a visible cost paid through surrendering the kerosene knot. The accumulative structure fits the textural lens, though the middle section's pressure could tighten between discovering and dancing the mosaic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of defying despair through "serious playfulness" emerges organically from Lira's actions, with the kerosene rag's transformation from "yesterday's risk" to absorbed song creating resonant non-literal meaning. The final image of spark taking root "not in sky, but in soul" reweights the entire journey without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive perceptual signature through pyrotechnic filtering ("phosphorescent dust," "harmonic dissonance") with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the mosaic dance. Some passages show register drift ("ambient awareness," "chromatic algorithm") that strains against Lira's established voice, and the absence of dialogue limits voice distinction testing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density appears in images like "petals that release phosphorescent dust, each step igniting momentary halos" doing multiple jobs, but several passages contain paraphrase loops ("filters everything...through ambient awareness, letting the fortress speak"). The prose maintains momentum through the closure sequence despite occasional abstract phrasing ("hopelessness gained gravity") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of pyrotechnics with botanical ruin creates fresh specificity, particularly in the mosaic's sonic cipher requiring physical dance to decode. The concept of explosions as prayers transformed into harmonic frequencies shows genuine originality, though some middle passages lean on familiar post-apocalyptic imagery.</comment>
