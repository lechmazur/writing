<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to learn the language of buildings is concrete and drives each choice, from the clay tablets to seeking the archivist's knowledge. The "agreed upon lies" create authentic internal conflict between connection and research goals. Minor deduction for the archivist's characterization relying slightly on exposition rather than embodied revelation in the tea scenes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist gains the key to truly communicate with the building, with visible cost in the years of patient waiting and coded exchanges. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the seal-to-key revelation. Orientation anchors (rooftop, neighbor, building sentience) establish cleanly by the 25% mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and sentient building create atmospheric pressure that shapes choices—the protagonist must learn to "write back" to walls that whisper. Sensory details like "meteors streaked silently overhead, painting the sky with fleeting silver scars" integrate with the mysterious tone. The building's agency ("sighed—not from wind, but recognition") constrains the final approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to reciprocal communication with a sentient structure, with the seal-as-cipher revelation forcing a new understanding. The cost is years of patient ritual and coded tea sessions. The "agreed upon lies" create sustained tension without requiring reversals, appropriate for this accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of language as connection—both human (the tea sessions) and architectural (the building's sentience). The seal's ouroboros and the key create resonant objects that reweight from ornamental inheritance to active tools. The ending achieves complexity: truth replaces lies, but connection deepens rather than simplifies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("dead as in retired, forgotten") and consistent POV that filters the building's personification through the protagonist's linguistic lens. Dialogue between tutor and archivist carries effective subtext in their riddling exchanges. Minor repetition in descriptive patterns ("patiently nimble" appears twice) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong opening image and propulsive sentences like "The building knew she was coming. And it had stories to tell." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some mild overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("fleeting silver scars," "velvet-lined cigar box") that don't quite justify their weight, though they support atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sentient building concept offers a fresh angle on connection and communication themes. The "agreed upon lies" as foundation for truth creates non-obvious complexity. Specific details like pressing seals into sun-baked clay tablets feel particular rather than generic, though the overall arc follows somewhat familiar patterns of revelation.</comment>
