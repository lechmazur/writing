<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between self-respect and compassion manifests through concrete micro-choices (reconstructing the tail, planning resignation with care protocols). The shift from blind trust to vigilant compassion shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in middle reflections ("conviction needed shedding") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara's stance crystallizes through the reconstruction ritual, foreclosing naive trust while preserving compassionate action. Cost is visible in her sacrificing savings and safety for the smaller sanctuary. Orientation anchored early (workshop, post-revelation timeframe). Minor deduction for slightly abstract middle passages about conviction-shedding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop setting with its tools, brazier, and glass case constrains and enables Elara's choices - the reconstruction becomes possible only through these specific materials. Sensory detail selective and POV-filtered (moss-stained boards, twilight-to-dawn pigment gradient). The mist/stars frame creates atmospheric pressure without overwhelming the intimate scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling integrity with compassion) established early and deepens through the reconstruction ritual. The tightening occurs when Elara commits to both testifying and opening her own sanctuary - foreclosing the easier path of pure abandonment. Cost visible in sacrificing savings and security. Slightly abstract in places rather than fully dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chameleon's tail as metaphor for necessary shedding/reconstruction without erasure. The final image of sleeping beside the glowing tail tip resonates as a "quiet promise" that reweights the entire betrayal narrative. Subtext operates through the reconstruction ritual itself. Minor deduction for one explicit thematic statement about "conviction needing shedding."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature (wildlife handler's attention to scales, pigments, creature behavior). Voice modulates effectively from reflection to focused reconstruction work. Some elevated diction ("keratin and color," "performative righteousness") occasionally drifts from Elara's naturalist register but remains largely coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Information density high in reconstruction sequence. Deductions for occasional abstraction loops ("conviction—once sturdy as oak—had cracked like thin ice"), some filter-heavy passages in middle third, and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages that could be more direct.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reconstruction-as-healing metaphor offers a fresh angle on whistleblower narratives, avoiding simple heroics for complex moral navigation. Specific details (pigment mixing, resin layering) ground the abstract conflict. The smaller sanctuary solution feels earned rather than convenient. Slightly familiar in the betrayal-discovery arc itself.</comment>
