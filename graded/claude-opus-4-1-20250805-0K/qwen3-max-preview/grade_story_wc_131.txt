I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory details and returning objects toward a resonant reconfiguration where visibility becomes resonance rather than physical emergence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation drives coherent action through embodied details like "tears streaking dust on her cheeks" and contradictory impulses between hiding and connection. The final choice to remain hidden while making herself known through objects shows earned complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("slow erosion of soul") that briefly pulls from embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the dweller reading the notice and choosing future visibility through "resonance" rather than spectacle, with felt emotional cost evident in her tears. The accumulative pattern of found objects building toward connection is well-established. Slight deduction for the power outage setup that doesn't fully integrate with the closure's logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crawl space micro-setting effectively constrains choices and the library's architecture enables the protagonist's archaeological ritual. Sensory details like "static cling of magnetic oxide on skin" are vivid and POV-specific. The "sapphire hush" effectively charges both opening and closing images, though some spatial choreography between spaces could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of visibility/invisibility deepens through the pattern of leaving objects, culminating in the tape fragment that triggers recognition. The cost of continued invisibility versus the risk of emergence creates genuine tension. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation than active pressure, and the power outage doesn't meaningfully tighten options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "cache" from hoarding to honoring, and visibility from spectacle to resonance. The tape fragment's message "you're not alone" creates powerful dramatic irony that reweights at closure. The final image of reading from her perch while choosing gradual emergence offers a non-literal answer to the visibility question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through archaeological metaphors and sensory focus on texture/sound. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical observation and emotional intensity. Minor inconsistency in register with phrases like "archaeology of abandonment" that occasionally drift toward academic abstraction for this focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory passages. Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive sentences and short emotional punches like "She didn't hoard them out of greed, but out of reverence." Some repetitive structure in "She didn't... She'd..." patterns and occasional abstract phrasing ("slow erosion of soul") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of an unseen library dweller who curates lost objects transforms the familiar "invisible person" trope through specific sensory archaeology. The shift from cache to connection and visibility to resonance shows genuine insight. The synthesis of isolation and connection through objects feels earned, though the setup relies on somewhat familiar emotional territory.</comment>
