<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act throughout—the protagonist carries both her father's destructive legacy and her own salvation-seeking drive, crystallizing in the lagoon scene where she chooses to harmonize rather than bury. The internal conflict between shame and love manifests physically through the coin ritual and her measured response to the fire call. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional language ("unyielding compassion") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with the lagoon ritual serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration where acceptance replaces erasure, showing clear cost in the line "Not to fix, not to bury, but to listen." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through kelp/tide imagery and pays it off when she runs toward fire "with kelp-drift peace." Orientation anchors solidly by line three, though the obsidian figure's emergence pushes against clarity without quite breaking it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The black sand and obsidian lagoon function as more than setting—they constrain her ritual and enable the communion with her father's essence. Volcanic sand as "beauty born in rupture" directly charges the thematic closure. The physical details of sand clinging to knees and boots create tactile grounding throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered imagery of fire/water, destruction/salvation, culminating in her choice to thread the coin around the figure's wrist—a gesture that forecloses the path of denial with visible cost. The tension between her professional duty (fire call) and personal reckoning creates authentic pressure, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor "Scars can sing, if you let them breathe" which gains resonance through the lagoon's harmonic response and her final run toward fire. The story resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity of loving someone who caused harm. The watercolor tattoo image particularly succeeds in embodying transformation without erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with strong perceptual signature—she notices "tide-pulled kelp," "salt-laced air," volcanic textures. The prose modulates effectively between lyric meditation and urgent action ("She taps the mic twice: 'En route'"). Some elevated diction ("unyielding compassion," "harmonic waves") occasionally drifts from the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of abstract language ("unyielding compassion" appears twice, "grace of tide-pulled kelp") and mild overwriting in the lagoon sequence ("harmonic waves, each crest a note, each trough a breath") prevent higher scoring. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformed imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter-as-arsonist's-daughter creates genuine complexity, avoiding simple redemption narrative. The specific detail of the father burning the cannery "because the rats inside were eating children's shoes" transforms a criminal act into misguided mercy. The coin ritual and obsidian lagoon communion offer non-obvious approaches to reconciliation.</comment>
