<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and rooted in her layered identity as witness/survivor/midwife, with concrete micro-choices (calibrating sundials, channeling resonance) that reveal values under pressure. The botanist memory and mammoth-walker identity create genuine internal contradiction between mourning and transformation. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("sovereignty," "coexistence") that could be more embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught brass/stone resonance system paying off when Veyra channels her atomic resonance to stabilize the failing hum—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("knees damp, breath slow"). The shift from extinction coordinates to genesis coordinates marks decisive change. Minor deduction for slightly delayed spatial orientation (cloud-library relationship clarifies gradually).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal library's brass sundials and stone circle hum create a unique constraint system that directly shapes Veyra's choices (running to secure Chamber Seven, channeling resonance). Sensory hierarchy reflects her temporal perspective—photons carrying whispers, vibrations through marrow. The environment literally pressures action when cloud-tides flood galleries, forcing urgent response.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving/transforming extinction memory) escalates through cloud-tide crisis where the stone circle's failure threatens the woodpecker coordinates—forcing Veyra to risk channeling her own resonance. The shift from preservation to genesis ("possible ones: hybrids, chimeras") deepens stakes meaningfully. Cost is visible in her physical state and the "weight of extinction" transforming to "lightness of coexistence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the brass sundial's evolution from marking extinction (woodpecker coordinates) to genesis (possible lifeforms), with the library transforming from "mausoleum of echoes" to "loom." The recurring resonance/harmony motif constrains choices and charges the closure. Final image of the library "turning its next page" offers non-literal answer to coexistence question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register ("contemporary of extinct species," "vapor-sea") and selective perception focused on resonance and temporal layers. Some elevated diction ("atomically reflective," "sympathetic resonance") fits the otherworldly POV. Deduction for occasional register drift into abstraction ("sovereignty," "midwife") and repetitive "She [verb]" stems in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and varied rhythm, particularly in crisis sequence ("ran, not to save scrolls...but to secure"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence runs ("She had seen...She had not...She did not"), abstract terminology clusters ("coexistence," "sovereignty," "independence"), and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction grief with active transformation through the brass sundial system that points to coordinates of lost species, then pivots to genesis. The atomically reflective skin as memory-storage and the library as living resonance system feel specific and earned. Risk-taking in the mythic scale and non-human timeframe heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
