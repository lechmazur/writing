<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herder's precognitive curse creates genuine internal conflict—he experiences it as theft of wonder while needing it as a tool. His embodied connection with the eel (touchless contact flooding him with grandmother's memories) and final transformation from seeing "the next second" to seeing "the next pattern" demonstrate earned character evolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the herder's curse transforms from burden to method through pattern recognition. The grandmother's promise recontextualizes from "understanding" to "method to ask better questions," with cost visible in decades of failure and the curse's perpetual theft of surprise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frictionless world constrains every action—no grip, no speech requiring tongue-palate contact, eels gliding rather than swimming. Aurora light "pooling like liquid mercury" and painted rocks' specific properties (ochre spirals, cobalt sigils) directly enable the harnessing sequence, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from failing to grasp sacred patterns through decades to achieving synchronization via painted rock sequences. The frictionless world's arrival triggers the eels' responsiveness, creating genuine pressure that narrows options to geometric arrangement rather than physical capture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: patterns as sacred syntax requiring alignment rather than control. The grandmother's "When friction fails, the sacred reveals itself in sequence" pays off through dramatized discovery, while the final realization about "method to ask better questions" reweights the entire quest without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"moved like shadow between tide pools," "aurora's borrowed dawn." Perceptual signature strong: the herder experiences precognition as curse stealing "the raw gasp of now," and physical description filtered through his eel-herding expertise and pattern-seeking obsession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"silver-throated, bioluminescent kind that slipped through rock like ghosts" establishes eel properties while advancing mystical tone. Some elevated diction ("sacred syntax," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally drifts from the herder's established register but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frictionless world as physical reality rather than metaphor is genuinely fresh—no grip, no speech, eels gliding through patterns. The synthesis of precognition-as-curse with pattern-based eel herding through painted rocks and collapsed star dust creates non-obvious convergence that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
