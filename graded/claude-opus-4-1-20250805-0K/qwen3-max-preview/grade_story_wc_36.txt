<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The relic keeper's motivation is clear and consistent—harvesting insights from failure rather than glory—with concrete embodied details like trembling fingers showing precision rather than fear. The protagonist makes meaningful micro-choices (breathing across the reed rather than playing, walking away from the flute) that reveal her hierarchy of values. Internal complexity shows in her rejection of the Council's "never" versus her lived experience of "hollow eyes of abandoned realms."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration ending where she becomes "keeper of thresholds" with visible cost (abandoning the flute). The piece anchors orientation clearly (Thunder-echo Range, seventeen years after guardianship) and maintains causality through her methodical approach. The closure lands with felt cost as she transforms from relic keeper to threshold keeper, leaving the flute to become "less instrument, more monument."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond description—the Thunder-echo Range's "avalanchingly quiet" nature creates atmospheric pressure, and specific details like "driftwood bleached silver by sun and salt" serve the ritual's precision. The between-place is vividly rendered with "gradient of forgotten hues" and "gravity bent politely," constraining her choices to observation rather than intervention. The amphitheater and its transformation into a pilgrimage site charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding how realms collapsed—escalates through concrete discoveries (Verdantis from ambition, Silmara from timidity, Khyren from perfection) that deepen understanding rather than reverse it. Agency manifests through her decision to witness rather than repair, with visible cost in leaving the flute behind. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as insights accumulate toward her transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the three collapsed realms' specific failures, avoiding direct moralizing until the earned final line "Some doors stay open by staying closed." The motif of weaving/unraveling constrains choices throughout (she cannot repair, only witness). The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing complexity through the paradox that "some collapses are necessary to clear the path."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in precise, contemplative observations like "silence fell like snow after a storm" and technical language ("harmonic node," "geomantic leylines"). The voice maintains consistency through measured, scholarly diction that fits the keeper's archival role. No dialogue appears, allowing full focus on the controlled interior perspective without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"gilded reed flute...brittle as old vows, yet humming with residual resonance" combines description, history, and potential. Some minor repetition occurs ("keeper" variations) but serves thematic purpose. Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of forensic magical archaeology ("This wasn't ritual. It was autopsy.") offers a fresh angle on the collapsed-worlds trope. Specific synthesis appears in how each realm's collapse teaches different lessons about artistic creation. The transformation from active keeper to witness/archivist feels earned and non-obvious, though some fantasy elements feel familiar.</comment>
