<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from "crisis actor turned real crisis survivor" through "slow erosion of pretending" shows genuine internal contradiction acted out through the walking patterns and gallery interactions. The choice to place the pawnless chessboard and continue walking despite the new sovereign's arrival demonstrates earned character change with visible cost—the terror of being "truly seen, without script or stage."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching ("heel-to-toe arcs tracing glyphs") that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator's walking spell "listen" forces the sovereign to confront "luminous absence." The closure lands with clear conceptual cost: the sovereign trembles from "the terror of being truly seen," and the gallery whispers back with all the small gestures that held the world together—a decisive reweighting of power dynamics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as active setting that constrains and enables action—its circular floor allows the word-walking patterns, its acoustics echo "silences shaped like breaths," and its architectural memory participates in the ritual. The interregnum timeframe creates specific pressure (suspended law, empty thrones) that shapes behavior throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: solitary walking becomes collective participation, the woman's ring placement unbinds her role, and finally the sovereign's arrival creates the peak test where walking "listen" applies maximum pressure. The cost is legible in the sovereign's trembling and the narrator's refusal to bow—power relations fundamentally shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central metaphor of missing pawns—"their absence was the point"—arguing that history moves through those who "vanish quietly" rather than kings alone. The final image of the gallery whispering back with "luminous absence of all the small gestures" offers a non-literal answer that completely reweights the power dynamic without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("silences shaped like breaths," "nomadic penumbra") that maintains consistency through emotional peaks. The perceptual signature is unique—noticing gestures like "the tilt of a head before grief" and walking patterns that spell words—though occasional elevated diction ("benevolently ruthless") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("heel-to-toe arcs," "the baker who still weighed flour with closed eyes") but some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") without full payoff. Minor repetition of "benevolently ruthless" and slight register elevation in peak moments, though the walking-pattern device propels effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conceit of walking patterns that spell words in a whispering gallery during political vacuum is genuinely fresh, transforming the familiar "interregnum" concept through specific embodied ritual. The missing pawns metaphor and "historian of small gestures" create an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure (+0.3 within band).</comment>
