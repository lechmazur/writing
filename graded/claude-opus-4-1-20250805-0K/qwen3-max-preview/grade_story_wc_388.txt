<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" drives concrete actions throughout, from reassembling letters to pressing the diamond into soil. Her internal consistency holds as she discovers the stillpoints network, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed. The final choice to continue searching embodies earned endurance with visible cost ("sorrow—for every orchard like this buried under lies").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she discovers the network of stillpoints and commits to "reassembling the world's broken pieces," with cost visible in her sorrow for buried truths. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the revelation that the diamond is a "tuning fork" transforming radiation. Orientation anchors clearly (wasteland orchard, post-liquidation world) though the transition from letter fragments to orchard arrival could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The irradiated orchard paradox creates immediate specificity—"roots drinking poisoned earth, fruit swelling sweet despite gamma winds." The diamond's function as environmental transformer constrains the protagonist's tactics when she presses it into soil and watches the dust storm stutter away. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tree examination to plaque discovery to eastward departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal investigation to world-scale discovery as she uncovers the stillpoints network, with meaningful deepening when the diamond transforms from "cursed object" to survival tool. The cost manifests in her sorrow for suppressed truths and her acceptance of being called "cursed" herself. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens though the middle section could tighten between letter assembly and orchard exploration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between "comfortable lies" and excavated truth, crystallizing in "Truth is not found. It is dug." The diamond's transformation from curse to tuning fork embodies the thematic reversal without explicit moralizing. The final image of her walking into the storm while others will "call her cursed" resonates with the cost of truth-seeking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("boots crunching on irradiated soil as peach blossoms glowed faintly"). POV distance remains stable in close third, filtering observations through her expertise ("intuiting patterns in the scars"). Some passages edge toward overwriting ("fractured warnings," "hymns older than radiation") but generally serve the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("The Stillborn Star," "spat out madness"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across four consecutive paragraphs. Information flow maintains momentum despite some abstract phrasing ("reassembled truth humming in her ribs").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of beneficial radiation-transforming crystals hidden as "cursed" objects offers fresh speculation within post-apocalyptic conventions. Specific details like "growth rings aligned with storm cycles, not seasons" ground the fantastical premise. The protagonist as conspiracy debunker in a world where truth literally got buried provides a non-obvious angle on survival fiction.</comment>
