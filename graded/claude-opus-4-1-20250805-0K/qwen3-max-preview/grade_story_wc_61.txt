<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sentimentalist's motivation to break generational patterns of destructive love is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied emotion in their handling of the gear and patient method. The transformation from calculating to feeling represents genuine change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("spaces where eyes might be") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the gear transforms from calculating to radiating, breaking the generational pattern. Cost is visible in the "troubling serenity" of gentle change that "might never be noticed." Orientation anchors (nebula garden, sentimentalist, gear) establish by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden functions as more than backdrop—its falling petals create rhythm and the cosmic environment enables the soul-frequency method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (violet/ember veils, phosphorescent glow). The gear as micro-setting constrains choice and charges the final image of "lighthouse without flame."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking destructive generational patterns) signals early and deepens through the gear's transformation. The choice of "slow seep" over "fire" represents meaningful agency with clear trade-offs—accepting that gentle change "might never be noticed." Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of fire/light metaphors and the gear's transformation from calculating to feeling. The final image of "lighthouse without flame" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the sonar pinging returns carrying memories and the gear's physical transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("the quiet sigh of falling petals"). POV remains stable with purposeful compression and metaphorical density that serves the otherworldly perspective. The prose modulates effectively between contemplative passages and the active transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though occasional density issues ("cathedral of gas and dust where petals of ionized plasma fell in slow, silent arcs across the quiet sigh of falling petals" repeats petal-falling). Some elevated diction borders on purple ("troubling serenity of success"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic scale with intimate emotional work—using a nebula garden for generational healing. The sonar-pinging method as soul-frequency pulses shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation of calculating gear to feeling instrument avoids predictable resolution. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and otherworldly POV heightens meaning.</comment>
