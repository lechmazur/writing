I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery and ritual actions toward a resonant reconfiguration where planting seeds in former battlefield soil represents restoration through "submerged concord."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation crystallizes through concrete ritual actions and his patient accumulation of seeds over seventeen winters. His internal contradiction between memory and mercy manifests in the physical act of crushing pods "gently under his heel." The choice to plant where specific soldiers fell ("where a captain had fallen clutching a locket") shows character-particular grief processing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual planting toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "some journeys are measured not in miles, but in sprouts." The cost is legible in "the tight, trembling space between what was lost and what might yet grow." Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words (coachman, jetty at twilight, post-war). The pattern of seed-planting-as-restoration teaches early and pays off in the final wagon departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains planting choices ("scooping damp soil from between the jetty's slats"). Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman's priorities: tactile seed weight, bird calls as verbs, soil mixed with ash. "The blooming jetty at twilight sighing underfoot like a tired lung" establishes atmosphere that charges the final image of trailing "dusk like a shawl."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: collecting seeds → listening to birds → crushing pods → planting in specific memorial spots. The dominant stake of restoration-versus-erasure deepens when he plants "where no one remembered names anymore." Cost appears in "the hollow where laughter should echo," though the piece could sharpen the price of choosing restoration over other paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of planting seeds in war-scarred earth, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of "submerged concord" - the quiet pact between root and wing, soldier and leaf - develops through specific ritual actions. The final image of measuring journeys "not in miles, but in sprouts" offers a non-literal answer to how we process collective trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the coachman perceives through botanical and linguistic lenses ("seeds that remembered war and whispered peace"). Voice modulates from lyrical opening to practical middle ("mixing it with ash he carried in a tin") to transcendent close. The bird dialogue creates authentic indirection where meaning emerges through translation rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in "He wore no livery, only a coat stitched with pockets—each holding a dried seed pod." Some elevated diction risks register drift ("narrow vastness," "gloom-hill") but serves the mythic tone. Minor redundancy in explaining submerged concord both directly and through demonstration. The line "trailing dusk like a shawl" exemplifies the piece's careful imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological restoration with linguistic archaeology feels fresh - speaking dead languages to birds who "still listened" transforms both elements. The specific detail of planting where individual soldiers fell with different intentions adds originality. Risk-taking in the experimental bird-dialogue exchange and the mythic register mostly succeeds, though "gloom-hill coachman" edges toward atmospheric convenience.</comment>
