<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter's methodical hope and ritual process create consistent motivation that drives meaningful choices, particularly in translating ephemeral kindness into permanent script. The teenager's arrival provides earned change through accumulated causality. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional states ("satisfaction" rather than embodied response) and occasional diagnostic clarity in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly with pattern-teaching early (glyphs, moon-brush, transmissions) and meaningful deepening through density increase. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the teenager joins the painter, creating visible change with implied cost (isolation ended, responsibility shared). The waxing moon progression provides coherent temporal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse constrains and enables key choices (isolation for silence, skylight alignment for ritual), while the smog-choked city provides necessary contrast. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt/jasmine during Vaelish glyph, saffron quiet). The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that charges multiple beats and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) accumulates pressure through escalating glyph effects, from barista's compulsion to teenager's arrival. Cost becomes visible through the painter's isolation and the weight of carrying this mission alone until the final shift. Some middle sections could tighten the connection between specific glyphs and their city-wide effects.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through accumulated images and effects rather than statement, with the brush as memory-keeper and glyphs as kindness-catalysts creating resonant depth. The final image of painting "not for the lost, but for the found" reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext operates beautifully in the silence between painter and teenager.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through the painter's synesthetic experience of transmissions and her specific way of seeing kindness as encodable. Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("dormant empathy slept like forgotten seeds"). The teenager's minimal dialogue preserves mystery while advancing plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in ritual descriptions that build world and character simultaneously. Some figurative density in early passages ("pooled like spilled ink," "confession booth for colors") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in middle exposition about the brush's history reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost languages, urban alienation, and art-as-transmission creates a non-obvious angle on connection themes. The specific mechanics of moon-charged brushwork translating kindness into unconscious action feels fresh and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
