<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spinner's sacrifice through dissolution into the weave demonstrates exceptional internal contradiction—her need to reach him requiring self-erasure. The amber bead functions as both memory anchor and beacon, embodying her conflicted impulse to hold on while letting go. Her choice to weave herself into the pattern piece by piece shows earned causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the spinner dissolves into the weave, her essence reaching across impossible distance at the cost of physical form. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each shuttle pass intensifies the transformation until the final "message had arrived" confirms both success and sacrifice. The amber bead's journey from orchard to city crystallizes the cost paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest create genuine constraint—isolation necessitates the magical solution while plum blossoms falling upward during the weaving marks reality bending under pressure. The amber bead with its "trapped firefly's ghost" functions as micro-setting that enables the final transportation. Spatial details like the "moss-slick boulder" and "crumbling stone wall" establish decay that mirrors the spinner's fading.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the spinner's progressive dissolution—"memories of his laugh, the scent of his cloak" transmuting into the weave forecloses return with each pass. The discovered puzzle shifts from curiosity to doorway, forcing the choice between remaining whole but separated or sacrificing form to reach him. The final cost—complete physical dissolution—charges the man's recognition when the bead appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central theme of sacrifice earning connection emerges through the weaving metaphor—threads of self becoming message. The recurring "raveling silence" transforms from oppressive to expectant to sighing completion, reweighting isolation as necessary crucible. The final image of the spinner "woven now into every star" offers resonant answer to separation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with selective perception like "bamboo leaves curled inward as if in reverence" reflecting the spinner's attunement to cosmic significance. Some register elevation occurs ("harmonic resonance," "fractured time") but serves the mythic tone. The shift to the man's POV arrives clearly at section break, though his segment lacks the spinner's textural richness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagistic density but suffers from repetitive constructions—"raveling silence" appears four times, "stoically sparkling" three times, creating echo loops. Information density remains high with lines like "threading not wool, but strands of twilight and wind-chime echoes" doing multiple jobs. Some ornamental phrases ("luminous glyphs," "harmonic resonance") edge toward purple without quite tipping over.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of weaving oneself into message to traverse impossible distance offers fresh angle on separation narratives. The puzzle-as-doorway discovery feels slightly convenient but transforms through the loom reconstruction into earned solution. The specific synthesis of textile craft with dimensional travel creates memorable framework, though some mythic elements feel familiar.</comment>
