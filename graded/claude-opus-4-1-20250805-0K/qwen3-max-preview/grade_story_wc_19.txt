<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The child's motivation to escape suffocating silence is clear and consistent, driving them through the ventilation shafts when gravity inverts. The final choice to not return is earned through their tasting of wild silences, though the transformation happens quickly. Internal conflict between security and starvation plays out concretely through whispered dreams to the doll.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as the child collects different silence flavors, building to a resonant reconfiguration where they choose the wild garden over the bunker. Cost is felt in the falling "sideways, through a fold in the sky" - an irreversible departure from known security. The gravity inversion provides clear causality for escape, though the magical realism elements strain credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bunker's "low ceilings of reinforced steel and echoing drip" establishes claustrophobia viscerally, while the xenial trellis offers precise sensory silences (snowfall's "crisp, crystalline quiet"). Setting constrains choice throughout - the bunker suffocates, gravity's reversal enables escape, the trellis nurtures transformation. The doll sprouting golden threads that merge with the trellis charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on the child's starvation for authentic silence versus the father's security, escalating when gravity inverts to create an escape opportunity. The child's agency drives the climb through ventilation shafts and the final choice to fall sideways rather than return. Cost is visible but could be sharper - we see departure but not what's specifically lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between curated and wild silences, with the doll's transformation from cold porcelain to golden-threaded life embodying liberation. The final image of silence tasting "of thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Each collected silence flavor deepens the theme of authentic versus manufactured experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with distinctive perceptual signatures like "the tongue of the soul" and "gravity sighed." POV remains stable through the child's sensory focus, though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("xenial trellis," "ambient light"). The piece teaches its magical realism pattern early and maintains consistency through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("clouds curled like sleeping lions") with good syntactic variety and information density. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("intangibly tangible" appears twice, "xenial") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor redundancy in silence descriptions but overall maintains momentum through varied paragraph lengths and clear sensory progression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of collecting silence flavors offers a fresh angle on escape narratives, with specific sensory details making it memorable. The gravity inversion as catalyst avoids typical bunker-escape tropes. The doll's transformation from witness to living bridge shows genuine ingenuity, though some magical elements feel slightly convenient.</comment>
