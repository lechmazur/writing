<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The collector's motivation centers on integrating grief through companionship rather than fixing it, a nuanced stance that drives her method of harmonizing with brokenness. Her micro-choices (playing the flute to harmonize rather than overpower, accepting spectral confessions) reveal consistent character under pressure. The "modestly fearless" trait manifests as choosing to kneel beside dread rather than ward it off, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("luminous ache") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ghosts' integration into the gorge's elements, with laughter literally seeping into wind and water. The accumulative lens holds as spectral confessions layer and transform through musical harmonization. Cost is visible in the collector's "throat tight with luminous ache" and the ghosts' gradual fading as they integrate. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where anchors solidify around word 150).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gorge functions as both setting and instrument, its geology warped by centuries of weeping into a misaligned harp that guides the collector. The crocodile's tooth actively metabolizes confession into grace, its edges smoothing as it absorbs sorrow. Environmental details (fissures catching wind, stones singing out of key) directly enable the collector's navigation and method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming spectral grief into integrated laughter, with escalation through the layering of confessions ("I forgot how to smile before I forgot my name") to the breakthrough giggle that cracks the air. The collector's agency drives the harmonization process, though the transformation feels slightly predetermined rather than hard-won. Cost manifests in the ghosts' fading and the collector's emotional bruising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the story's treatment of grief and laughter as siblings rather than opposites, with the collector's method embodying accompaniment over cure. The final image of a child's giggle carried downstream while another gorge waits ahead resonates without moralizing. The crocodile's tooth as a relic that "remembers" rather than bites enriches the thematic texture of transformation through integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("modestly fearless beneath a sky blushing with violet and gold"). The perceptual signature shows selective attention to sound and resonance fitting the collector's role. Some elevated diction ("luminous ache," "metabolized confession") occasionally strains against immediacy but serves the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the tooth "catching dawn-light like a secret" establishes both time and mystery). Some figurative density in emotional beats ("luminous ache—that tender bruise of joy and loss pressed together until they bled the same color") approaches overwriting. Minor repetition of "misaligned harp" and template structure in ghost descriptions ("men who'd drowned in wine, women who'd buried their songs").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of a collector who harmonizes with broken music rather than fixing it offers a fresh angle on grief work. The crocodile's tooth from "River Styx's lesser cousin" and the geology-as-instrument premise show imaginative world-building. The transformation of laughter from lost to integrated through musical accompaniment avoids predictable healing narratives.</comment>
