<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and rooted in her betrayal-turned-binding, with her "lovingly venomous" nature manifesting through devotion twisted into obligation. Elara's inherited burden creates a meaningful change through transmission rather than simple resolution, with visible cost in the ghost's dissolution. Minor deduction for the ghost bride's limited agency as she follows the bead's resonance rather than making active choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost bride's essence infuses into the orchard, transforming haunting into heritage with visible cost (her dissolution) and gain (fruit bearing). The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift when twilight fruit appears. Slight deduction for the midpoint having less causal linkage between Elara's recognition and the greenhouse's awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting effectively constrains the ghost bride to "this glass cathedral of eternal twilight" where "blossoms never fall but also never bear fruit," directly shaping the story's central tension. Vivid sensory details like "frost-laden winds," "night-blooming jasmine and regret," and fruit "the color of twilight" create atmosphere. Deduction for some spatial choreography gaps in how Elara navigates the space and interacts with the mandrake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying the debt across lifetimes—escalates through the bead's intensifying resonance near Elara, culminating in the transmission that transforms curse into gift. Cost is visible in the ghost bride's dissolution and Elara's inherited burden. However, Elara's agency is limited (she receives rather than chooses), and the resolution lacks a true foreclosed path since the transformation appears inevitable once contact is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of debt from punishment to balance, with the final twilight fruit serving as a non-literal answer to whether love can transcend betrayal. The "lovingly venomous" paradox resonates through concrete details rather than abstraction. Minor deduction for Elara's whispered insight "You were never meant to suffer alone" edging toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with gothic-lyrical texture using phrases like "iron-boned ribs" and "glass cathedral of eternal twilight" that maintain consistency. The prose modulates effectively from ethereal description to visceral sensation when Elara tastes the fruit. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("resonant awakenings," "ephemeral cameo appearances") that doesn't fully align with the intimate POV moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both atmosphere and stakes. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("ghost bride drifted"/"She ghosted through") and template cadence in the middle section's "She had been"/"He thought"/"Her vengeance" construction. The prose maintains momentum despite these artifacts, with the final fruit sequence achieving excellent sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gothic greenhouse-as-purgatory with an alchemist-botanist ghost offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The transformation of haunting into heritage through botanical alchemy is unexpected. However, the ghost-bride-seeking-resolution template is recognizable, and while the specific execution elevates it, the core premise doesn't fully escape genre conventions.</comment>
