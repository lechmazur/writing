I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the narrative follows a clear because/therefore progression from resuscitation through confrontation with fear to resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with concrete physical manifestations of emotion ("molars ache and eyelids twitch"). The protagonist's transformation from haunted victim to active agent confronting fear is earned through specific sensory details. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("knot of dread coiled beneath my ribs") that edges toward metaphorical convenience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from resuscitation to funhouse confrontation to fear's dissolution, with visible cost (extracting traumatic memories). The closure lands as a Decisive Change with the protagonist defeating fear through recognition. Orientation anchors established early ("abandoned carnival funhouse"). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric specificity with "mildew and the ghost of cotton candy," cracked mirrors reflecting dread, and the Hall of Whispers. The funhouse setting actively constrains and shapes the confrontation. Setting details evolve causally as fear dissolves "pixel by pixel, melting into the funhouse floor."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear escalation from wandering to confrontation to revelation that fear is "the hunted thought." The dominant stake (conquering fear) tightens through the extraction of memories and direct confrontation. Cost is visible in the physical act of reaching into one's chest to extract trauma. Slightly mechanical in the fear-as-mirror revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox that "fear's weakness is being seen for what it is: a reflection, not a ruler." The dream dictionary's paradoxes ("To conquer fear, invite it to tea") pay off in the actual confrontation. Minor deduction for the advisor's somewhat direct thematic statements at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with baroque descriptions ("flickering afterimages that clung to my peripheral vision like grease on glass"). Consistent POV with controlled psychic distance. The whispering advisor's dialogue carries effective subtext about fear's nature. Strong perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich figurative language mostly serves pressure ("pixels" of dissolving fear, "photographically cursed" memories). Some density issues with stacked metaphors in places. Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor loops in the fear description sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival horror with psychological confrontation. The concept of fear as a "hunted thought" rather than hunter offers genuine insight. The opera cloak clasp as talisman and dream dictionary as guide show inventive detail. Some familiar horror tropes prevent higher scoring.</comment>
