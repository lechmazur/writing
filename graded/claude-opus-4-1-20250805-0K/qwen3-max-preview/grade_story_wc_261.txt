<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's transformation from "closure seeker" to someone who embraces continuation is earned through concrete struggle with the seed's revelations. The scar as both physical marker and evolving metaphor (from "tragedy to threshold") provides embodied emotional progression. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around grief and blessing that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the final Resonant Reconfiguration landing powerfully—Elira's integration with the seed transforms her fundamental approach from seeking endings to embracing continuation, with visible cost in her weeping recognition of the "lie she'd carried." The hourglass's transformation from frozen to "spiraling outward" crystallizes this shift. Slight deduction for the convenient tunnel opening, though the plant telepathy setup partially earns it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower setting with its coffee-stained table and root-tangled catacombs provides concrete constraints that shape Elira's path to the seed. The ivy's worried curling and the cathedral's buried miracle create a lived-in world. Deduction for some vague spatial transitions in the tunnel sequence and the somewhat generic "damp met dark" descriptions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal healing through the scar examination to the cosmic weight of the seed's power to "resurrect what should stay dead," with Elira's choice to integrate rather than use it marking genuine transformation. The cost is felt in her weeping recognition and the permanent change to her nature. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth path through the tunnels.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of continuation versus closure emerges organically through concrete images—scars that tell stories, frozen sand that finally flows in spirals, coffee rings that map paths. The seed's revelation that "endings could be sealed" is a lie resonates without moralizing, and the final image of spiraling sand "like roots, like scars, like stories that refuse to end" perfectly synthesizes the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature—Elira notices through wounds, plant whispers, and story-marks. Phrases like "silence pooled like spilled ink" and "the meteor hush still clinging to her shoulders" create distinctive texture. Slight deduction for occasional overwriting in metaphor density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "violet light crept over the tower's eastern sill" and strong information density. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("displaced miracle," "fossilized roots," "symmetric satisfaction") and some metaphor clustering in high-pressure moments reduces clarity. The repeated "not... but" construction becomes noticeable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of reading stories in scars and wounds as text offers a fresh angle on healing narratives. The plant telepathy as "botched blessing" and coffee rings as story-maps show imaginative world-building. The transformation of the hourglass from frozen to spiraling provides an original image for time's relationship to narrative.</comment>
