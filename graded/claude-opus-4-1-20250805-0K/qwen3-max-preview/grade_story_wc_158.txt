<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drives consistent choices throughout, with her shell-dwelling isolation and nightly rituals embodying this singular purpose. Her "shyly unstoppable" contradiction manifests through concrete actions—hiding from audiences while climbing to whisper verses daily. The ending's shift from lullaby to psalm shows earned progression, though the transformation could use sharper embodied cost beyond "trembling."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the galaxy postcard's warming and new text providing the decisive deepening that triggers her shift from lullaby to psalm. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through "something like rest—not in her bones, but in the spaces between her words," showing Earned Stasis with visible cost. Orientation anchors clearly (poet, shell, post-war), though the transition from war memories to present could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shell functions as active setting—its "spiraled chambers echoing with memories" and "calcium walls" where verses fossilize constrain her choices and shape her art. Sensory work excels: "bioluminescent plankton pulsed like slow heartbeats," "wind whistling through barnacle-teeth and kelp-strings." The shell's innermost spiral becomes her creative crucible, directly enabling the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmuting collective trauma through art—deepens when the postcard warms and reveals "They're listening. Keep singing," forcing her shift from private lullabies to public psalm. Cost appears in "centuries of longing had carved her bones hollow" and the price of never sleeping, though the escalation could tighten further through more concrete obstacles to her mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "reef-shadow joy: the kind that thrives where light fractures," avoiding direct statements while the orchids-from-scorched-earth image resonates throughout. The postcard as galaxy-of-blossoms and the shell's fossilizing verses create layered meaning about art's permanence. The ending's "spaces between her words" offers a non-literal answer to how beauty emerges from suffering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with distinctive constructions like "time didn't tick—it spiraled" and "reef-shadow joy," though occasional elevated diction ("gargantuan," "ensconce") slightly strains the intimate register. The perceptual signature of noticing through sound and texture ("crooked hymns," "salt-crusted journals") remains strong. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence ("Fishermen claimed to hear her in their nets at twilight") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some mixed metaphors ("time spiraled" then "pooled") and occasional register elevation ("transmute," "photosynthesize") create friction. Information density remains high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of art as biological process ("photosynthesize pain") offers fresh specificity, while "reef-shadow joy" creates original emotional taxonomy. The galaxy postcard depicting "supernovae shaped like peonies" synthesizes cosmic and botanical in non-obvious ways. The shell-as-recording-studio-and-archive transforms the hermit-artist trope through specific physical constraints.</comment>
