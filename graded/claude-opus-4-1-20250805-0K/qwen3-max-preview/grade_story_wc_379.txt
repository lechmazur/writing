<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief through Leo's "breath hitched" and sustained weeping, with Elara's patient humming ritual revealing character through action. The locket's "grieving" quality and Leo's transformation from hollow isolation to tear-streaked laughter shows earned change through accumulated connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught ritual (Tuesday deposits, four-dawn humming visits) building to Leo's cathartic release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo shifts from isolation to community connection, with visible cost in his weeping. The mailbox's organic "exhale" strains credibility slightly but doesn't break the emotional logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Jasmine-scented courtyard and "warm locket" provide selective sensory grounding, with the locked mailbox as functional constraint. Setting enables story mechanics but doesn't fully constrain choices—Leo could have been approached directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's patient four-dawn ritual, with Leo's resistance creating genuine tension before his surrender. The cost is visible in his sustained weeping and the community's shared grief stories, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "listening heals" emerges through accumulated action—the mailbox ritual, Elara's object-listening practice, and communal story-sharing. The final seashell's "thank you" resonates without moralizing, though "trauma doesn't shout—it echoes" edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct curator voice with selective perception ("whispered of a life interrupted"), though some phrases feel elevated ("rough as unwashed linen"). Clean POV control throughout with purposeful distance shifts during Leo's emotional release.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "trapped wing" envelope, but several template constructions ("She didn't... She simply waited") and repetitive "She didn't" openings. The "organic exhale" metaphor strains logic within the established realistic world.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh concept of curator who "collects stories" through object-listening, with the locked mailbox as original community healing mechanism. The four-dawn humming ritual and objects containing emotional resonance show creative specificity.</comment>
