I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered descriptions and metaphorical density rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to map absence through obituaries is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "fingers tracing the palace carpet weft thread." Internal conflict between presence and absence drives meaningful choices, though the final moment could show more visible cost in the character's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the traveler's method of "mapping absence to make the gone gloriously present," with the thread as a persistent constraint. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early and maintains coherence, though the cost at closure could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active pressure through "damp stone," "brittle leaves," and the garden where "marble nymphs wept lichen tears." The thread's sensory presence ("crimson glow," "pulsed faintly") and the paper crane tucked under roots show environment constraining choices and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes intensify through the progression from general absence to specific focus on Elira, with the traveler's obituary becoming "a compass" that reweights loss as orientation. The deepening from passive grief to active cartography shows meaningful escalation, though more visible cost in the mapping act itself would strengthen this.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the geography metaphor system - "mapping valleys of absence," "topography of laughter," "geography of healing." The final image of making "the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present" offers a non-literal answer to how we process loss without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in selective attention to texture ("damp stone," "gold-rimmed leaves") and the narrator's cartographic lens filtering everything. Voice maintains consistency through elevated but controlled diction, though some passages like "lonesome splendor" edge toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive structures appear: "Perhaps they'd think... Perhaps they'd weep... Perhaps they'd carry." Some metaphor strain in "forests where roots whispered forgiveness to fallen leaves" reduces clarity. The piece avoids loops but has moments of overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of writing obituaries for the living to map absence is fresh, executed through specific details like the coup-smuggled thread and Elira's forced exile. The transformation of grief into cartography offers genuine insight, though some metaphorical reaches feel familiar.</comment>
