<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner's seasonally mute nature drives meaningful choices throughout, with her silence as "precision, a canvas upon which vibration painted meaning." Her motivation crystallizes through embodied action—placing palms on ice, adjusting counterweights during storms—though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("meteorology of soul"). The child encounter provides the sole test of her values, where she chooses awakening over explanation with visible impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward the protagonist's death and the sculpture's continuation—a valid Earned Stasis with cost. Orientation anchors clearly (bell tuner, whispering bluff, kinetic sculpture by ~100 words). The closure reweights prior material when the sculpture continues "without her," though the ghost/echo coda slightly dilutes the cost's sharpness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment constrains choices as it "reacts to harmonic frequencies" and must be touched to activate, while the sculpture's "calibrated chimes" that strike only when conditions align shapes the tuner's work. Setting moves beyond description when storms "roll beneath the clouds" requiring counterweight adjustments. The bluff's "spiraling stone path" with "every fissure" creates tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving wonder's capacity to be felt, tested when the child arrives and gasps—"the first honest reaction they'd ever known." Escalation reads through accumulation: daily climbing, storm adjustments, the child's awakening, then the tuner stopping her climb with the sculpture continuing. Cost appears in her death/absence, though agency at closure shifts to wind and weather rather than protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sculpture's function: "not to explain, not to convert, but to awaken." The iceberg's glow "refracting not light but longing" and the child's "full-body tremor" embody wonder without abstraction. The ending reweights everything when the sculpture continues its truth-symphonies autonomously, suggesting art's permanence beyond its maker—though "symphonies of truth" occasionally veers toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric precision with distinctive perceptual signature: "wind hummed through hollow stone," "fingers brushing bronze and iron not to speak, but to listen." No dialogue preserves the mute protagonist's consistency. Rhythmic control heightens during the child scene where shorter sentences accelerate pace. The prose successfully sustains its elevated register without head-hopping or distance wobbles.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "calibrated to strike only when atmospheric pressure, temperature, and emotional gravity aligned." However, abstract phrases like "meteorology of soul" and "emotional gravity" edge toward purple prose. Some repetitive structures appear ("She'd smile then," "She'd pause," "The tuner nodded") creating mild template cadence that doesn't quite warrant the full penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The permanently mute artist preserving wonder through non-verbal resonance offers genuine freshness, particularly the sculpture continuing posthumously. The iceberg fragment as "glacial memory" from "the last melting pole" adds climate elegy without preaching. While the concept of art outliving artist isn't novel, the specific synthesis of muteness, kinetic sculpture, and atmospheric calibration creates distinctive texture.</comment>
