I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Inferred Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the recluse's bow acknowledges the ghosts' gratitude.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The recluse's characterization emerges through embodied action (tracing the box rim, shielding it during storms) and her "tranquilly perceptive" nature manifests in how she reads the ghosts' gestures. Her motivation to preserve unspoken weights drives consistent choices, though internal contradiction could be sharper. The final bow shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the beekeeper's ghost turns with gratitude and the recluse bows - a crystallized moment where her role as keeper is acknowledged. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through ghost observations and ritual repetition. Cost is legible in her covenant's weight and isolation, though the exact price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wasteland and ruined oasis create immediate atmosphere, with specific details like "skeletal hives," "rusted smokers," and the stained glass box constraining the recluse's choices. The setting actively shapes her covenant and daily rituals. The environment charges the final image when dying light casts "honey-gold glyphs" - setting as active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - preserving unspoken weights versus releasing them - is signaled early and deepens through accumulated ghost observations. Tension builds through the recluse's vigil and the box's unopened presence. The final acknowledgment between ghost and keeper provides meaningful deepening, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the architecture of silence and the weight of the unsaid. The stained glass box becomes a resonant symbol without forced meaning. The ending offers a non-literal answer about witness and preservation through the recluse's bow and the light's "language only silence could speak."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with distinctive perceptual signature ("ghosts shimmering like heat mirages given form"). No dialogue appears, focusing entirely on the recluse's selective attention. Rhythmic control heightens atmosphere without sacrificing clarity, particularly in the dense opening establishing the wasteland.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She bore no name now; names were for the living who still traded words"). Some elevated diction ("mute eloquence") fits the mythic register. Minor repetition of "silence/silent" but serves accumulative pattern. Strong propulsion through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of a recluse reading ghosts' unspoken words through gesture offers fresh angle on familiar ghost story territory. Specific details like the beekeeper's vest and child's drawing ground the concept. The covenant binding her to preserve rather than release creates non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
