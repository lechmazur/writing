<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The technician's motivation is clear and consistent—discovering what neglect conceals—with concrete embodied details like "wiped grease from his brow" and the physical act of prying ceiling tiles. His internal stance crystallizes through micro-choices (sitting on the counter, tucking evidence away gently) that reveal values. The ending choice to witness and document shows earned wisdom through specific experience, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("That was the weightless burden he carried").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the building "keeping vigil" and him as "the witness it had been waiting for," with visible cost in carrying others' unfinished stories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns, found objects, and ghostly presence build density toward the crystallized ending stance. Orientation anchors clearly (abandoned circus ticket office, repair technician), and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the dust patterns guide discovery, the ceiling tile conceals evidence, the broken marquee spelling "C_R_U_" mirrors incomplete memory. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("faintly of popcorn and sawdust," water drop "vibrated in his molars"). The circus atmosphere pervades through specific remnants that shape his investigation path, though some description tends toward the ornate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what neglect conceals—deepens through the dust pattern discovery leading to the ceiling tile revelation, with cost visible in his responsibility to witness. Escalation is textural rather than causal: from observing disturbances to finding the child's drawing to encountering the sequined ghost. The final acknowledgment "I see you" forecloses his observer stance, accepting the burden of memory-keeping.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the drawing labeled "DADDY," the pearl button, the ghost composed of "lint, ash, the ghost of glitter"—without explicit moralizing. The concept of witnessing neglect resonates through specific objects and gestures, particularly the final image of closing the door "gently, as if tucking in a child." The recurring motif of incomplete things (broken marquee, unfinished stories) charges the closure without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with distinctive perceptual signature ("silences where laughter used to live," "dust curled away from the baseboard like fleeing children"). POV distance remains stable in close third. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("the weightless burden he carried"), and syntactic patterns occasionally become repetitive, but the voice coherently supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("ambient moonlight reflect off its curve") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Several instances of overwriting ("lint, ash, the ghost of glitter") and register drift into elevated diction clash with the technician's working-class position. Template cadence appears in places ("He didn't move... Then he heard it... He turned slowly"), though information density remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fusion of ghost story with mundane elevator repair work offers a fresh angle, particularly the use of technical tools (mainspring barrel) for supernatural investigation. The specific detail of dust patterns spelling footsteps and the ghost appearing as environmental disturbance rather than traditional specter shows originality. However, the abandoned circus setting and lost child backstory lean on familiar tropes without full transformation.</comment>
