<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The immortal's motivation is crystal clear—seeking "what happens after goodbye" through eons of ennui—and drives every choice toward the fragment's activation. His contradictory impulses (boredom vs. reverence) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when he smiles at spatial mutiny. The final choice to step through carries visible cost (his sanctuary collapses) though the warlock's memory trade feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through magnetic crescendo to spatial mutiny to the final plain of goodbyes. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the immortal achieves wonder through "the quiet thunder of endings" with his sanctuary's destruction as visible cost. Orientation anchors (immortal, prismatic escondite, fragment) establish by ~80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and magnetic storm actively constrain the ritual's timing and method—he waited centuries for this specific storm. Vivid sensory work ("walls breathing hues no mortal eye could parse," "sky screamed violet and gold") though some descriptions edge toward ornamental. The setting's collapse into "a single point of indigo light" directly charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond goodbye) escalates through the fragment's activation, spatial mutiny, and sanctuary collapse. The magnetic storm provides necessary pressure that narrows his window. Cost is legible—his refuge destroyed, stepping into the unknown—though agency feels slightly passive during the mutiny sequence itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through accumulated farewells—"a mother's lullaby cut short," "a soldier's oath dissolving"—without stating morals. The final image of "the quiet thunder of endings, hushed and holy" offers a resonant answer about the weight of closure. Strong subtext in the warlock's traded memory and the god's "broken heart."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("ionized regret," "sandpapered awe into ennui") that matches the immortal's perspective. Clean third-person limited with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature strong—he notices magnetic fields, dimensional awareness, the "murmuring plain" in character-specific ways. Some register elevation in peak beats but maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression, but several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("whips of ionized regret," "dais of solidified aurora"). Template cadence appears briefly ("He heard...A soldier's...A poet's..."). Information density high and most lines do multiple jobs, though some ornamental flourishes don't advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortality-seeks-death trope through "what happens after goodbye"—not death but resonance of farewells. The spatial mutiny and dimensional awareness of the fragment feel specific. The god who "refused to die twice" and the library "between heartbeats" show imaginative world-building, though some elements feel slightly derivative of fantasy conventions.</comment>
