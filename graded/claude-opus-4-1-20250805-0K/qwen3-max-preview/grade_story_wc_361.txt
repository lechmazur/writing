<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal contradiction between routine calcification and wonder recovery drives the piece. The courier's transformation from jaded to wonder-spreading is earned through concrete choices (choosing Hollow Market, sharing pendant with child). Minor deduction for the mentor figure remaining somewhat abstract despite his thematic importance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly with the pendant's release as Resonant Reconfiguration—she seeds wonder by letting go, with visible cost of losing her method. The pattern of "vibrating sympathetically" pays off through market scene and final dissolution. Slight dock for orientation arriving late (~150 words for full grounding).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and Hollow Market create atmospheric pressure that shapes choices—she reads sky-glyphs, chooses market for its dragonfly-lanterns. The pendant functions as micro-setting constraining tactics throughout. Strong sensory hierarchy filtered through courier's shifting attention to wonder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Central stake of recovering/spreading wonder escalates from personal (pendant vibration) through interpersonal (child encounter) to communal (market transformation). The cost is legible when she releases the pendant. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the stakes could sharpen slightly at the child encounter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pendant's arc from private talisman to shared catalyst to released seed. "Wonder isn't inherited, it's cultivated" crystallizes without moralizing. The final image of her humming what "only the wind remembered" offers resonant answer to the central question of how wonder persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm—"brittle frost that sang," "ghost in her marrow." Perceptual signature shows selective attention to resonance and vibration. Minor compression under peak moments ("Everything does, if you vibrate sympathetically enough") maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"jittery" establishes character while "aurora-lit ridgeway" sets scene and tone simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("germinate," "sympathetically") fits the fantastical register. Slight deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("across the fade from memory to myth").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier-as-wonder-spreader with the dragonfly pendant as sympathetic resonator creates non-obvious angle. The transformation from routine to legend through small acts of attention feels earned. Risk-taking with the lyric mode and conceptual ending heightens rather than obscures (+0.3).</comment>
