<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor hidden labor is consistently embodied through concrete actions (mending nets, whistling names, pressing palm to stone), though internal contradiction could be sharper. The final "I see you" and descent without marking creates earned renunciation with visible cost. Some moments lean toward performed rather than lived emotion ("demure audacity humming in her veins").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the philosopher's witnessing stance crystallizes with felt cost ("vanished into the alleys"). The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains coherent pressure through pattern accumulation. Cost is legible in the ephemeral footprints and the choice to remain unseen while honoring others.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The parapet setting constrains movement ("bare feet cool on slick stone") and provides specific interaction points (chalk-markings, moon paths) that shape the philosopher's ritual. Sensory details filter through her craftsperson's attention to texture and pattern. The environment actively participates in the closure through the fading footprints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort deepens through accumulation (widow's story, chalk marks, harbor lanterns) with the philosopher's choice to remain anonymous creating tension. The whistling evolves from testing air to weaving wonder, showing progression. Cost appears in choosing invisibility over recognition, though a sharper trade-off at closure would strengthen impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated particulars (mended nets, erased tallies, blinking fireflies) without explicit moralizing. The tea whisk as "totem of persistence" and the fireflies' imperfect rhythm create resonant specificity. The final image of continuing despite invisibility offers a non-literal answer to the value of unseen work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters through the net-mender's attention to patterns, knots, and textures ("silver sheen left where moonlight pooled"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("scintillatingly somber") that strains against the craftsperson perspective. Strong rhythmic control in meditative passages, though occasional overwriting dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines advancing atmosphere or theme, but figurative language appears too frequently ("like starlight caught in a spider's thread" followed immediately by "luminous, yet heavy"). Template cadence emerges in "She + verb" patterns across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but needs pruning of ornamental phrases that don't constrain choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a manual laborer as philosopher examining hidden patterns offers fresh specificity, avoiding typical sage archetypes. The integration of craft knowledge (net-mending, tea whisking) with philosophical observation feels organic. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off, though some metaphors feel reached-for rather than inevitable.</comment>
