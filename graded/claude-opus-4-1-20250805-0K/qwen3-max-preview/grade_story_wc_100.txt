<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's transformation from passive resignation to active purpose is earned through concrete interaction with the lens fragments, with his "inadvertently stubborn nature" manifesting as meaningful action rather than label. His final choice to go "deeper" rather than surface-ward demonstrates genuine character cost. Minor deduction for some interiority that tends toward abstraction ("reverence," "belonging") rather than embodied sensation in key moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the library transforms from "mausoleum of knowledge" to "cathedral of quiet endings" with visible cost (the undertaker's permanent commitment to the depths). The lens broadcasting pattern teaches itself early and pays off through accumulated soul releases. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the underwater setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underwater library setting actively constrains and enables choices—lens shards must be embedded in specific architectural features, books float in "brine-stilled currents," and the environment itself "remembered light." The drowned city's impossible physics ("places where time bent, where pressure didn't crush but cradled") directly enables the solution and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to collective soul-release through the undertaker's agency, with each prism placement building pressure toward the culminating "amber radiance." The cost is legible—he trades any return to the surface for this deeper calling. Minor deduction as the middle section's soul appearances could have shown more resistance or complication before resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "distress signals" into "acknowledgments" and finally "belonging," avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of giving rest "a permanent address" evolves from physical graves to "impossible spaces" of light and memory. Slight deduction for the "cathedral of quiet endings" metaphor feeling marginally over-articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and strong perceptual signature ("molars ache," "bone-handled tools"). The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the lens activation sequence. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match the undertaker's established lexicon ("metaphysics," "reverence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and high information density, particularly in the prism-placement sequence. However, some passages contain near-duplicate concepts ("rest a permanent address" appears twice verbatim) and occasional abstract phrasing ("architechture of his design"). The filter-verb cluster in the soul-appearance section ("didn't speak," "didn't need to") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-psychopomp with underwater gothic and lighthouse imagery creates non-obvious resonance. The transformation of distress signals into belonging through physical lens fragments embedded in library architecture is genuinely inventive. The commitment to impossible underwater physics ("pressure didn't crush but cradled") takes meaningful risks that heighten the otherworldly stakes.</comment>
