<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keeper's scattered memory mirrors the realm's fragmentation effectively, with her incomplete lullaby memory embodying the loss of communal bonds. Her transformation from fragment curator to "loom" represents earned change through vulnerability rather than mastery. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("weight of safety") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing cleanly—the realm transforms from shroud to cradle through collective song, with visible cost in the keeper's weeping recognition. The mica windows' transformation from prison to mirror provides clear before/after. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (greenhouse location emerges gradually) though this serves the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mica windows effectively constrain and release light, becoming central to the story's mechanics of hoarded versus shared dawn. The greenhouse setting with alchemical trees provides both atmosphere and functional space for the spiral climb. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors ("trapped starlight") though the mirror world justifies this register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (keeper's scattered memory) through communal (forgotten songs) to realm-wide transformation, with the mica's response to humming providing the key tightening moment. The cost is visible in the community's prior isolation and the keeper's vulnerability. Slight deduction as the resolution feels somewhat inevitable once the singing begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The swaddling metaphor evolves beautifully from physical comfort through communal binding to giving "space to grow," avoiding tidy resolution. The theme of collective memory versus individual isolation emerges through concrete action (singing together) rather than assertion. The final image of mica as mirrors reflecting "what was reclaimed" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm that intensifies during the song sequence. The perceptual signature—focusing on texture, memory fragments, and synesthetic details—remains consistent. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("ancient, necessary truth") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("dew-kissed moss that glowed faintly") and good rhythm variation. However, some passages edge toward overwriting ("apricot, rose, and honey-gold") and there's occasional abstraction ("rhythm of belonging"). The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("breath by breath, note by note").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of communal song literally reweaving reality offers fresh take on collective healing narratives. The mica windows as light-hoarders and the alchemical greenhouse create specific, memorable world-building. Slight deduction as the resolution mechanism (singing together heals) follows somewhat predictable pattern despite strong execution.</comment>
