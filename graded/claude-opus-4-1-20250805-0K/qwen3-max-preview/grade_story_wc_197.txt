<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—her methodical resourcefulness and patient rebellion earn the final broadcast's impact. The character avoids stock rebel tropes through specific tactics (reading puddles, rewiring rather than hacking), though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("truth cool as forgotten truth"). Her final disappearance with the Ace of Keys card demonstrates earned agency with visible cost—she sacrifices capture for the revolution's success.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from lagoon observation through archive infiltration to broadcast success, with Elira's resourcefulness driving each turn. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the regime's control fractures through restored memories, with cost visible in Elira's necessary vanishing. The puddle-map discovery mechanism strains credibility slightly, and the ease of her escape undercuts the established danger, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon and underground archive create atmospheric pressure, with sensory details like "dust and static" and "magnetic tape and punch cards" grounding the speculative elements. The puddle reflections as navigation system shows invention, though the mechanism remains somewhat abstract. Setting actively constrains choices—the lagoon's specific light patterns enable entry, the archive's analog nature determines her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on breaking the regime's information monopoly, with escalation from individual infiltration to city-wide broadcast. The conflict develops through Elira's methodical approach rather than dramatic reversals, fitting the "carefully resourceful" characterization. However, the lack of active opposition during the archive sequence and the too-smooth escape deflate potential pressure—enforcers arrive only after she's completed her mission and vanished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between erasure and remembrance, with the Archive Engine serving as both literal plot device and metaphor for suppressed truth. The final image of children hearing "lullabies about rebellion" resonantly inverts the opening's "state-approved lullabies about obedience." The story resists explicit moralizing, though phrases like "tyranny of indifference" occasionally push toward declaration rather than dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent control with evocative phrasing ("lagoon shimmered...swallowing the last blush of dusk like a secret too heavy to keep") and character-specific perception. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical observation and technical precision during the rewiring sequence. Some moments edge toward overwriting ("auric fire"), but overall the distinctive texture serves the story's coded-freedom tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density remains high—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. However, several instances of elevated diction ("auric," "latent memory," "siphoned power") create mild register drift, and occasional overwriting ("liquid mirrors that warped and revealed") slightly impedes momentum without adding precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection navigation system offers genuine invention, transforming the typical hacker-rebel narrative through analog methods and patient observation. Elira's character—turning "trash into tools, silence into strategy"—provides fresh specificity to the resistance archetype. The Archive Engine as analog rather than digital storage and the broadcast through "dormant lines" show thoughtful world-building that resists generic cyberpunk conventions.</comment>
