I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the pattern of layered imagery and density shifts that build toward the final transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between holding silence and offering healing operates effectively through embodied detail ("knuckles hover, trembling"). The earned renunciation at closure ("does not look back") carries visible cost through the accumulated scar imagery. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in emotional states ("mourner and midwife") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation from sanctuary to open field, with clear cost ("suffocation ends... when you stop fighting the shape of your own throat"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight opacity in the middle transition from door to field prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting constrains choice effectively through its "fading threshold" that must be crossed, and the transformation to "field of unlit lanterns" charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("burnt sugar and old tears"). The spatial choreography during the threshold crossing could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each scar "pulses" and memory threads are pulled to "stitch a new passage." The cost is legible in the final teaching: permission to "fumble in the dark" rather than providing light. The single meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bridge-burning metaphor that transforms from destruction to careful healing ("so no one is trapped on the wrong side"). The final image of the sanctuary folding into memory while she moves forward offers a resonant, non-literal answer about release and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature maintains lyric control through sustained metaphorical vision ("tender shadow keeper," "linking through scars"). The rhythmic modulation from held breath to final movement supports pressure. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains the intimate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She burns bridges carefully—not with fire, but with measured silence"). Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("mourner and midwife," "anointing her") creates slight opacity. Template cadence appears briefly ("She did not..." repetitions) but serves rhythmic purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of silence-as-teaching with physical threshold-crossing feels fresh and inevitable. The specific angle on healing through absence rather than presence transforms familiar sanctuary imagery. Risk-taking in the lyric density heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
