<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "thread a labyrinth with his own story" before discovery drives coherent choices, with internal conflict between inherited mistrust and the need for witness. The final renunciation ("The story was no longer his to tell") carries visible cost. However, the spectral witnesses lack individual characterization, functioning more as collective pressure than distinct agents.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the lattice transforms the lighthouse beam into a permanent carrier of suppressed truths, with clear cost ("spent," "slumped"). The accumulative lens holds as whispers gather into luminous truth. Minor orientation gap: the specific nature of "the bodies" remains vague, slightly weakening causal stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting constrains every choice—from the narrow door entry to the lantern room mechanism that enables the transformation. Sensory detail ("air tasted of brine and candle wax") filters through POV urgency. The lattice-as-micro-setting charges the final image when it melds with the lens, making the lighthouse itself the truth-teller.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal redemption to collective witness as the boy's action summons the disbelieved dead, forcing him to seal truth into the world before discovery. The cost is visible ("staggered back, spent"). However, the search party arrival lacks immediate pressure—they're "late and loud" but pose no active threat to the completed transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of dismissed cries into "luminous truth" via the lighthouse beam. The ending reweights the cry-wolf legacy without stating a moral: "the lighthouse never lies." Subtext operates through the lattice holding "sins too heavy for heaven, too light for hell," though some passages edge toward explicit ("Truth, made luminous").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains poetic compression with controlled rhythm ("Wind gnawed at the jagged reef"). POV stays cleanly limited to the boy's perception with no head-hopping. However, register occasionally elevates beyond character plausibility ("copperlight repose," "origami") and dialogue is entirely absent, preventing character voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery ("breath shallow, palms slick against rust") with varied sentence structures. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple purposes. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("folding space like origami") and abstract phrasing ("sustained, gentle, hovering in the air like breath before a kiss") that dulls momentum in the final movement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise freshly inverts the cry-wolf tale through generational mistrust and spectral vindication. The lattice as confession-holder that "sustains impossibilities" offers genuine ingenuity. However, the lighthouse-as-truth-beacon resolution, while well-executed, echoes familiar symbolic territory without full transformation.</comment>
