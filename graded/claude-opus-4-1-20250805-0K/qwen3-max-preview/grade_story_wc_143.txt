I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation—witnessing what no one else would record—drives consistent choices through purposeful curiosity and bitter communion. Internal contradiction between professional duty and personal elegy creates authentic tension, particularly in "I was here when it ended." The final choice to label and not look back shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the 05:00 grain fall creating Resonant Reconfiguration—the inspector's vigil transforms from documentation to communion with clear emotional cost ("throat tight"). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. The closure lands as Earned Stasis: accepting the message will remain unheard while bearing witness anyway, with palpable melancholy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lunar environment actively constrains through vacuum chemistry, thermal spikes at dawn, and regolith texture. The hourglass's sodium metasilicate/ilmenite reaction depends on precise atmospheric pressure, making setting integral to the device's function. Mare Imbrium and Survey Marker Theta-9 anchor geography while "windless, breathless" summit atmosphere charges the final vigil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through chemical countdown to 05:00, with the inspector's personal need to witness colliding with the device's engineered obsolescence. The deepening occurs when she realizes the message is "meant to outlast its audience," forcing her stance from archivist to vigil-keeper. Cost manifests in accepting beauty without reception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hourglass's "farewell sung to an empty auditorium"—human ingenuity persisting beyond purpose. The inspector's shift from photographing to communing reweights the entire premise: persistence honors itself, not its audience. "Some things aren't meant to be seen. They're meant to be known" crystallizes this without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through technical attention ("sodium metasilicate layered with lunar ilmenite") and poetic observation ("bleeding dawn"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical inspection to emotional vigil. Slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("Beauty intact") stays within character bounds for someone choosing this solitary mission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially technical descriptions that build both world and emotion. Some figurative density in peak moments ("marrow," "sky too bright to weep") but serves accumulative pressure. Minor repetition of "meant to" in closing weakens momentum slightly but doesn't touch closure impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The Nightwatch Hourglass concept—messages encoded in micro-gas bursts released over a century—offers genuine ingenuity. Transformation of witness-bearing from professional duty to personal elegy provides emotional specificity. The inspector's particular brand of melancholic dedication feels authentic, though the lone observer trope is familiar.</comment>
