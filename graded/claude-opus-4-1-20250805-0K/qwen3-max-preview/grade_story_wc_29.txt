I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Elira identifies the threat, develops countermeasures, and successfully deploys them.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and rooted in expertise, with concrete internal conflict between professional protocol and direct action. The choice to intervene carries visible professional risk. However, interiority occasionally lapses into explanatory mode ("Think of it as tuning a poisoned violin") rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from signal detection through counter-frequency deployment to community calming, with clear cost (Elira abandoning protocol, risking exposure). The closure shows Earned Stasis - she remains vigilant against future threats. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The radio booth setting functions well as both workspace and battleground, with charts and equipment constraining tactics. Strong specificity in "yellowed astronomical charts" and "jury-rigged box of capacitors." However, the broader campus/town setting remains somewhat generic beyond functional markers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal detection to community threat to direct confrontation with cosmic entities. The tricksters' irritation when "realizing its prey had teeth" shows meaningful reversal. Cost is visible in Elira's isolation and the ongoing vigilance required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of expertise versus institutional paralysis emerges organically through action. The final image of Elira whispering "Try me again" resonates without stating a moral. However, the "language of stars and turn their lies into lullabies" metaphor veers slightly toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature (technical precision, pattern recognition). Voice modulates effectively with tension. Minor slip: "Good." as fragment reads slightly affected rather than organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in technical passages. However, some metaphorical density ("tuning a poisoned violin," "stars and turn their lies into lullabies") and occasional template phrases ("allowed herself half a smile") slightly diminish impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh angle on alien contact through subsonic psychological warfare rather than direct invasion. The concept of "cosmic tricksters" who "corrode" rather than conquer offers genuine originality. Specific technical details (counter-frequency generator, oscilloscope monitoring) ground the fantastical premise effectively.</comment>
