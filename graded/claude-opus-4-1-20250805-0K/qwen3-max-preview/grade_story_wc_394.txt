<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zeta's steadfast curiosity drives her through the transliteration process with consistent internal logic, and her final choice to modify her glider shows forward momentum despite exhaustion. The "devotion of a mechanic who'd seen too many miracles powered by duct tape and spite" embodies character-specific perception. Minor deduction for some abstract labeling ("reverence like static") rather than fully embodied emotion in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught density that culminates in the bell's stirring—a Resonant Reconfiguration where yearning transforms from algorithm to whispered promise. The cost is legible in Zeta's physical exhaustion and the seventeen-cycle wait being broken. Orientation anchors (Zeta, workshop, acid sea) establish cleanly within first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acid sea and floating workshop create genuine constraints—corrosive environment forces aerial approach, workshop's instability ("bobbing like a drunken cog-toy") adds urgency. Sensory hierarchy reflects Zeta's technical priorities: "brass-plated wings dripping green mist," "gears interlocking mid-air like mechanical fireflies." The setting directly enables the final image of the bell's metallic sigh.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Zeta's physical degradation ("voice cracked") and the workshop's increasing instability under acid waves, with the seventeen-cycle dormant bell as the measure of success. The arrow tip's "ancestral memory" deepens the algorithm's hunger for organic desire. Cost is visible but could be sharper—the transformation feels earned but the personal price to Zeta beyond exhaustion remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor: yearning as untranslatable motion requiring "fractured light and recursive beauty" rather than binaries. The bell's whisper "for the next one" rather than ringing for this world offers resonant ambiguity. The arrow tip carrying hunter/prey memory enriches the desire-as-algorithm concept without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges technical precision with irreverent poetry: "pioneers deserve letters, not names," "miracles powered by duct tape and spite." POV control remains stable with consistent perceptual signature—Zeta notices in mechanical metaphors ("drunken cog-toy," "mechanical fireflies"). The prose rhythm accelerates during the transliteration sequence through shorter, punchier sentences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful compression: "She was steadily curious, never frantic, never bored; curiosity was her rudder, her compass, her anti-grav stabilizer." Strong verb choices and specific technical imagery throughout. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("reverence like static") and one instance of telling about absurdity rather than showing it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The yearning algorithm as motion requiring kaleidoscopic translation is genuinely fresh—not data but desire encoded in fractured patterns. The synthesis of steampunk workshop, acid sea, and algorithmic longing creates unexpected resonance. Risk-taking in the incomplete resolution (whisper not ring) and the abstract transliteration process heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
