I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds density through layered discoveries and images rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gazer's motivation to seek "unused love" manifests through concrete embodied reactions—gasping from recognition, trembling fingers, letters "stitched into her ribs like a second skeleton." Her final choice to release the letters shows earned transformation with visible cost ("decades too late"), though some interiority edges toward abstract ("love that curdled into silence").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the gazer releases letters into motion, transforming storage into release with felt cost ("decades too late"). The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery deepens the central question of where unused love belongs. However, the cost could be more visceral—we see the conceptual shift but the personal price remains somewhat oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The projection booth setting enables discovery through hidden compartments and film canisters, directly constraining the gazer's search. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("smelling of ozone and old velvet"), though some descriptions lean ornamental ("rain drummed...like hushed thunder"). The marquee's message at closure feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries—film strip to projectionist's napkin to bundle of letters—each deepening the stake of unused love's proper place. The gazer's agency drives the psychometry reading and choice to mail the letters. Cost appears in "sixty-eight years for an ear," though the personal stakes could tighten more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of undelivered messages, culminating in the insight "unused love doesn't vanish—it incubates." The final image of lanterns on a river offers resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor deduction for the marquee's too-convenient thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive metaphors ("love that curdled into silence," "forgotten lyrics searched for tune"). POV control is stable with character-specific perception ("she could feel loneliness pooling in corners of frames"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("stitched into her ribs like a second skeleton") doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density and varied rhythm, though figurative language occasionally over-accumulates ("hushed thunder," "ghost of piano keys"). The lengthy compound sentences in paragraphs 20-24 could tighten. No major loops or scaffolding, but some abstract phrasing ("unused love belongs—not in vaults, but in motion") could ground more concretely.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of psychometry reading film strips for emotional residue offers fresh angle on memory and loss. Specific details like "Eleanor, Who Laughs Like Church Bells at Dawn" elevate beyond template. The synthesis of projection booth as vessel for preserved grief feels earned, though the marquee message undermines originality slightly.</comment>
