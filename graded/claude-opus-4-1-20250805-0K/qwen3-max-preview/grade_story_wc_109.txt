<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession with "charting absence" drives consistent micro-choices throughout, with her methodical summarizing of silences creating a concrete hierarchy of values. The final choice to enter the mapped darkness shows earned agency with visible cost (leaving the fort's safety), though interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as density increases through catalogued silences, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she enters the territory she's charted. Who/where/when anchored early (ridge fort, storm, last star). Cost is legible in her transformation from observer to participant, though the precise mechanism of "mapping silence" remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ambered hush functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and shapes her method, with strong sensory hierarchy (silence over sound). The storm-fort contrast creates pressure, and the gold leaf booklet's physical decay mirrors thematic erosion. Setting actively guides her final choice to descend into mapped darkness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping the endless night) established early and deepens through accumulated silence-summaries. The storm's external pressure contrasts with internal stillness, creating tension. Her final descent forecloses the option of remaining safe, though escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the architecture of absence—what silence withholds versus reveals. The final image of "marbled hush: striated, calm, and strangely welcoming" offers a non-literal answer about finding structure in void. Subtext operates through the contrast between external storm and internal mapping, avoiding direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("hollows between them," "coordinates only the lost could follow"). POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature strong in how she processes silence over sound, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("honeyed resin trapping ancient breath").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative language occasionally obscures ("ambered hush" appears frequently without clear physical correlate). Some paraphrase loops around silence-mapping concept. Prose rhythm varies effectively with storm/stillness contrast, though elevated diction sometimes strains POV credibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and silence creates memorable premise—mapping absence rather than presence. The oracle's specific obsession with "spaces where meaning collapsed and reformed" transforms the familiar wise-woman trope. Risk-taking in the abstract concept pays off through concrete cataloguing of particular silences.</comment>
