<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gardener's transformation from seeing graves to seeing thresholds represents genuine character evolution earned through tactile engagement with the tapestry's threads. Her interiority is concrete and embodied through specific actions (pressing palm to fabric, threading needle), though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("intentions were not destinations, but gestures"). The final shift from humming lullabies to whispering questions demonstrates meaningful change with implied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the gardener's perception fundamentally shifts. The descent into the silo, untangling of threads, and return to the cemetery create clear progression, though the middle section's revelations about buried letters and silent sacrifices feel somewhat disconnected from the opening's cemetery work. Cost is visible in her recognition of "silences she'd kept, love she'd trimmed" but could be more sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as transformative space that constrains and enables the central action, with vivid sensory detail ("curved walls drank the moonlight, turning the air into liquid twilight"). The tapestry's physical properties directly shape the protagonist's choices and discoveries. The cemetery-silo-cemetery movement creates meaningful spatial progression that charges the final reframing of headstones as thresholds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding intentions and unfinished stories—deepens through the tapestry untangling sequence, with each thread revealing specific losses (buried letters, swallowed joy). The escalation from external observation to personal recognition ("these were not strangers' stories, but reflections") provides meaningful tightening. However, the resolution lacks a sharp decisive moment where cost becomes undeniable; the transformation feels more contemplative than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central theme of unfinished intentions and half-completed gestures emerges organically through concrete images (threads as souls' unfinished sentences, serpents swallowing tails). The final insight about intentions as "half-finished prayers flung into the dark" resonates without moralizing. The piece successfully reweights its opening material when headstones become thresholds, offering a non-literal answer to questions of mortality and connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyric control with distinctive perceptual signature ("dew-damp grass," "liquid twilight"). Some passages achieve genuine beauty ("messy, overlapping spirals—some broken, some braided"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that strains against the gardener's established voice ("almosts and could-have-beens," "gestures—half-finished prayers").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and vivid imagery throughout, particularly in physical descriptions. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, several abstract passages dilute momentum ("Intentions were not destinations, she realized, but gestures") and some metaphorical vehicles stretch coherence (the silo "trembled—not with quake, but with release"). The piece avoids major loops but occasionally paraphrases concepts rather than advancing them.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cemetery gardener who communes with the dead while discovering unfinished stories in an abandoned silo offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of mortality, craftsmanship, and emotional archaeology feels specific rather than derivative. The transformation of graves into thresholds provides a non-obvious reconfiguration that feels earned through the particular journey.</comment>
