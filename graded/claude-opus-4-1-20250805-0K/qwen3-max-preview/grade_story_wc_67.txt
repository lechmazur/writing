I'll evaluate this atmospheric literary piece about the ash scatterer in the gallery, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on the density patterns and cadence shifts that build toward the final resonant image.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash scatterer's characterization achieves strong embodied specificity through the porcelain mask's origin story and her ritualistic actions with cremated emotions. The interaction with the visiting woman demonstrates clear motivation through action rather than declaration. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "weaves truth carefully" that borders on label-speak, though the powder-scattering ritual grounds this adequately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds well with density increases around the powder ritual and the rocking chair's stillness charging the final configuration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the visiting woman leaves "lighter somehow" and the scatterer sits in the now-still chair—cost is felt through "weight she didn't know she carried." Orientation anchors clearly (gallery, dusk, protagonist established early). Deduction for the cost being somewhat oblique rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gallery setting transcends mere backdrop through specific tactile details—"walls lined with canvases that seemed to breathe," the rocking chair's "slow, creaking rhythm," hardwood floors that "whisper." The porcelain mask functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and interaction. The stillness of the chair becomes environmental pressure that triggers the ritual, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative density rather than causal reversals—the powder ritual intensifies, the woman's recognition creates emotional pressure, the chair's stillness forces confrontation with "absence." The dominant stake of capturing/honoring fleeting emotion before it evaporates coheres throughout. Limited by the visitor interaction feeling somewhat brief and the cost remaining primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central metaphor of incomplete portraits capturing absence—"the ghost of a smile, the echo of a scream." The "mirage of safety" concept integrates organically through the mask's sharp edges that "cut lies" and the gallery as witness-space for fractured emotion. The final image of sitting in the motionless chair while "truth remains—carefully woven, imperfectly held" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent atmospheric control with selective perception ("canvases that seemed to breathe," "voice curled around corners like smoke"). Some elevated diction ("ephemera into artifact") fits the gallery context. Deduction for occasional register drift into abstract conceptual language and some filter-heavy passages that reduce immediacy during the powder ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around safety/fragments/absence that creates mild loops. "The mirage of safety" appears three times with similar framing. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("frozen screams," "bleeding light") without consistent payoff. The powder ritual section maintains better concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central conceit of scattering cremated emotions as powder over charcoal portraits offers genuine originality. The porcelain mask made from mother's shattered teacups provides specific, non-generic backstory. The transformation of traditional portrait-making into this ritual of incomplete capture elevates familiar gallery-story territory through specific texture and emotional logic.</comment>
