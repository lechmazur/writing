I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through metaphorical exchanges, moon phase timing, and symbolic object trading toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where two former enemies achieve "swapping ghosts" rather than prisoners.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters embody contradictory impulses well - she waits with "mind untethered from old rage" while gripping her father's drawer pull. The exchange of relics (drawer pull for cell key) creates genuine emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "furrowed hush between apology and forgiveness" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands: enemies become "two souls synchronizing" through exchanged relics, with visible cost in their shared grief. The accumulative build through mist/wind/moon imagery coheres well. Deduction for slight orientation delay - the prisoner exchange context emerges gradually rather than anchoring early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The parapet setting effectively pressures choices - "no shelter—only exposure" forces vulnerability. Mist and wind create atmospheric pressure throughout. However, the setting could more actively constrain specific choices beyond providing neutral meeting ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from waiting alone → his arrival → relic exchange → walking together. The dominant stake (reconciliation vs maintained division) tightens when they exchange objects with clear emotional cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete exchange: "swapping ghosts" rather than prisoners, with relics embodying their losses. The moon phase metaphor ("gibbous—almost whole, but not yet") resonates without overstatement. Final image of synchronized walking reweights all prior division.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density. Dialogue carries strong subtext ("Did you bring the names you buried?"). Some passages edge toward overwriting ("wind stitching silence between them") but generally the texture serves pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence: "peace is never signed in ink but carved in silence." Information density generally high. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("lead of loss into something that could bear weight") and some abstract phrasing that slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of prisoner exchange negotiation transformed into "swapping ghosts" shows genuine originality. The moon phase synchronization and relic exchange feel organic to these specific characters. The emotional complexity avoids tidy resolution while maintaining clarity.</comment>
