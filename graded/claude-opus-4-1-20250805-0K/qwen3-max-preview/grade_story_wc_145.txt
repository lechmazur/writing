<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's dry wit and cartographic obsession create a distinct, consistent voice with concrete motivations rooted in finding "where myth and meltwater converge." The internal progression from detached precision to witnessing shows earned change, though the emotional complexity could deepen further under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where condensation patterns lead to the discovery of the convergence point beneath the ice, with the narrator shifting from "editing" to "witnessing." The cost is felt in the transformation from "worrying tranquility" to deeper satisfaction, though the physical stakes could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen lake setting actively constrains and enables the discovery—ice that "sighs" rather than cracks, condensation patterns on glass becoming divination tools. The outpost's isolation and the thermodynamic method create a lived-in world where environment directly shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on finding the mythic source of rivers, with pressure building through the falcon's delivery, phrasebook translations, and condensation patterns culminating in the ice revelation. While the discovery lands with resonance, the physical or temporal cost of this quest could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the synthesis of "language, land, and liquid" without exposition—the idea that origins require patient observation rather than conquest. The final shift from editing to witnessing reweights the entire quest as one of humility before natural mysteries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains dry wit ("feathered bureaucrat") and cartographic precision throughout, with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization. The prose rhythm appropriately quiets during the discovery moment, though occasional elevated diction ("star-stung dark") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rivers begin where language listens" compresses theme and plot elegantly. Some figurative density in places ("star-stung dark," "bookmark in the fabric of reality") approaches overwriting but remains controlled enough to maintain momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of using condensation patterns and dead languages to find underground river convergences is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of cartography, linguistics, and thermodynamics into a coherent discovery method, combined with the dry-witted narrator's voice, creates something memorably specific. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3).</comment>
