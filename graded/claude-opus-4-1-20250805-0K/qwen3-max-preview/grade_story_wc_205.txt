<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The revolutionary's transformation from active rebel to contemplative scholar is well-motivated through concrete details like the crystal shard rosary and his method of covering mirrors. His internal contradiction between destroying and preserving civilization drives authentic tension. The collaboration with Voss provides meaningful external pressure that forces him to crystallize his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the revolutionary finds purpose in "translation" rather than triumph. The cost is legible in "wept—not for loss, but for possibility" and the foreclosed path of traditional revolution. The mirror-covering discovery provides causal linkage that transforms understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting with "marble veined with fossilized starlight" and visible time-streams creates vivid atmosphere that constrains choices—the chrono-winds force the mirror-covering method. Sensory details like "boots clicking against marble" ground the ethereal premise. Setting actively shapes the discovery method though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mourning to civilizational reimagining through the mirror-covering discovery. The tempest scene provides meaningful tightening where covering mirrors reveals the glyphs' true message. Cost is visible in tears and the abandonment of his original revolutionary path, though pressure could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between violent revolution and quiet translation, with the haiku serving as calibrations of grief and hypothesis. The final image of being "alive, not in triumph, but in translation" resonantly reweights the entire revolutionary arc without stating a moral. The discovered civilization's values (wealth in shared silence, leadership in listening) provide concrete thematic embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in phrases like "rosary of regrets" and "tombstones for ideals." Voice modulates effectively from melancholic reflection to discovery excitement. The haiku interludes provide rhythmic variation though some passages drift toward elevated register ("burnished sorrow") that slightly strains the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence ("crystal vase shard like a rosary of regrets") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Some register drift into academic diction ("spectral scans," "harmonic frequencies") and occasional template cadence in the discovery sequence reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of covering mirrors to decode time-distorted glyphs offers genuine freshness, as does the civilization that measures "wealth in shared silence." The revolutionary-turned-archaeologist arc avoids predictable redemption narratives. However, some elements (baroque asteroid, visible time) feel more ornamental than fully integrated into the story's logic.</comment>
