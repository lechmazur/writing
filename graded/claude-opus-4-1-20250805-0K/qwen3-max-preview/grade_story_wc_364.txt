<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlo's quiet determination manifests through consistent embodied actions—descending daily into shafts, tracing glyphs, weaving magic into tools—with his internal contradiction between meekness and forge-like resilience driving meaningful choices. The final transformation where he "becomes the barter" is earned through accumulated micro-choices, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("forge waiting for its spark") rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Arlo's daily ritual of weaving silk into tools builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where he transforms from vessel to source ("He had become the barter"). Cost is visible through the silk's depletion and Arlo's willing sacrifice, though the glyph's sudden permanence feels slightly convenient without clearer causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard world with dangling roots and mine shafts creates a vivid paradoxical setting that constrains Arlo's choices—he must descend to access magic, work in darkness, emerge at specific times. The silk's resonance "at the frequency of half-remembered spells" and the glyphs that "made sense for three heartbeats" exemplify purposeful sensory specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving "meekness was not weakness" through the gradual depletion of the silk resource, with meaningful escalation as villagers grow stronger while Arlo's material thins. The final cost—giving up the silk entirely to become the source himself—lands clearly, though middle pressure could tighten further through more immediate obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "bartered awakenings" from desperate trades to willing gifts, with the silk serving as both literal material and metaphor for shared resilience. The ending achieves resonance without stating its moral, as small acts ("hinges that didn't squeak") embody larger transformation, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with purposeful compression ("He didn't need the silk anymore. / He had become the barter.") and character-specific perception where Arlo notices forge-like qualities in everything. The controlled rhythm accelerates toward closure, though occasional register drift into elevated diction ("azure defiance") slightly exceeds the blacksmith's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("fruit-laden trees rooted in floating soil, their roots dangling through arches into nothing"), though some paraphrase loops appear ("to coax resilience from rubble, to prove that what was buried could still rise"). The final sequence from "He didn't need the silk anymore" forward shows exemplary propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of magical barter system with quiet craftsmanship offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives, particularly the inversion where giving away power becomes the source of power. The specific detail of tools that "whispered courage to trembling hands" transforms familiar tropes, though the setup draws from recognizable fantasy-blacksmith templates.</comment>
