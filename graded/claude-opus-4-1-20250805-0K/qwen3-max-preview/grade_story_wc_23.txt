I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds density through lyric repetition, image accumulation, and cadence shifts rather than causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The navigator's moon-phase embodiment creates genuine physiological constraints that shape her choices (waiting, respecting rhythm). Internal contradiction manifests through her simultaneous mourning of machines and embrace of their silence's possibilities. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("geography of loss") that occasionally replaces embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—the navigator's acceptance of "recalibration" over "abandonment" with visible cost (the hydraulics' failure, isolation). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from physical station to metaphysical navigation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality opacity around the phone calls' mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rusted gantry, bronze censer foot's ghost-heat, and Junction 7's silt create tactile, lived-in specificity. Moon phases physically constrain choices (joints stiffen, thoughts sharpen). The starlit signal station functions as both literal setting and metaphorical space for loss-navigation, directly shaping the navigator's methods.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on navigating loss through unconventional means, with moon phases creating genuine constraints (walking into static during wrong phase). The accumulative escalation builds from personal loss to cosmic reverse migration. Cost is more conceptual than visceral—the acceptance of seepage over resurrection—which fits the textural mode but lacks sharp physical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the reverse migration concept—loss flowing inward rather than outward. The bronze foot that "remembers smoke" and coordinates given as "scent and shadow" create resonant non-literal meaning. Final image of "recalibration" reweights the hydraulics' failure without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic navigation ("where jasmine choked on diesel"). Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression and elision. Some register elevation ("calcified into stone," "seepage") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, and repetitive sentence openings ("She doesn't...She builds...She weaves") create minor template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of textural specificity ("fingers tracing the patina bronze censer foot like a rosary"). Information density high in peak passages. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs and some abstract phrasing ("geography of loss," "lattices of meaning") that could be more concrete. Minor synonym churn around navigation/charting concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of technological failure with mystical navigation, transforming post-apocalyptic tropes through specific moon-body connection. The reverse migration concept offers genuine conceptual originality. The cryptic phone calls to frequencies rather than numbers shows imaginative world-building, though some elements feel slightly derivative of mystical realism traditions.</comment>
