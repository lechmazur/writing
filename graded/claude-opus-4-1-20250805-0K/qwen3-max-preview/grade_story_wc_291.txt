<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization through Elira's face blindness which drives her unique investigative method and creates authentic internal conflict. The killer's contradictory impulses ("I didn't kill them"/"I took their faces") act simultaneously in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for the killer's emotional arc feeling slightly compressed in the final confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with texture memories anchoring the investigation and building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where empathy awakens through shared grief. Cost is visible in the killer's tears and trembling, though the resolution of three cold cases without bodies strains plausibility slightly. Who/where/when anchored early through quarry setting and '89 timeline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quarry functions as more than backdrop—its mist, limestone walls, and abandoned machinery constrain choices and create atmospheric pressure. Texture details (silk decay, salt-stiff collar, quarry dust) are filtered through Elira's unique POV and directly enable the investigation. The preserved masks behind glass in the foreman's office provides crucial spatial specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build through textural accumulation: ribbon fragment → sketches on walls → killer's emergence → mask revelation. The dominant stake (remembering the vanished women properly) deepens when Elira's empathy project succeeds through the killer's grief. Cost is legible in his weeping and the town's collective mourning, though agency feels slightly diluted in the collaborative resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of erasure/remembrance emerges organically through face blindness, masked victims, and textural memory. The final image of the killer sketched faceless resonates powerfully, reweighting the entire investigation as shared humanity rather than pursuit of justice. Subtext operates beautifully through the masks as both concealment and preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled fragments ("No bodies. No blood.") that accelerate pressure. Perceptual signature strong through texture-focused observations replacing visual descriptors. The prose modulates effectively between investigative precision and emotional rawness. Minor dialogue feels natural with appropriate indirection ("They were beautiful").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with varied syntax and strategic fragments building momentum. Information density high—most lines advance multiple story elements. Some mild repetition in the "She didn't"/"Didn't" sequences, but largely purposeful for rhythm. The final image lands with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Face-blind detective investigating through texture rather than sight offers genuine freshness. The killer as grief-stricken preserver rather than murderer subverts expectations meaningfully. Risk-taking in the ambiguous resolution (no bodies, no court closure) heightens thematic stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
