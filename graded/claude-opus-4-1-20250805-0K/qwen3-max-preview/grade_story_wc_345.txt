I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where collective unity manifests the nebula.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's ghostly agency paradoxically drives concrete action through chalk messages and bell-finding, with her "strangely trustworthy" presence creating authentic character tension. The settlers' transformation from refugees to kin shows earned collective change, though individual characterization beyond Kael and Liora remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community's synchronized action manifests the nebula, with visible cost in leaving the dying orchard behind. The accumulative structure builds from chalk messages to bell discovery to collective ritual, each layer deepening the dominant stake of survival-through-unity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inverted gravity orchards, crystallized pollen dome, and violet root-vein sidewalks create a lived-in alien world that directly constrains action—messages must be chalked on specific surfaces, the bell hangs in a particular dome. The nebula's manifestation "drawn by their unity" makes setting inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: mysterious messages → bell discovery → collective gathering → nebula manifestation, with the orchard's thinning roots creating genuine urgency. The stake of collective survival versus dispersal is clear, though individual cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of ghostly guidance and collective agency—"not salvation delivered, but summoned." The butterfly helix and nebula-as-bridge imagery resonates without forcing interpretation, and the orchard's pride in its people's departure adds thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive constructions like "brambled but blooming" and "a lullaby written in cosmic dust." The perceptual signature filters everything through Elira's spectral consciousness, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("wings of migrating sky-eels").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn. Not digital, not shouted—but handwritten, fragile, intimate." Minor overwriting appears in extended metaphors, but rhythm varies purposefully and no loops or scaffolding mar the flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-orchestrator premise offers fresh angle on community formation, and specific world-building details (gravity-marbles, seed-song baskets) avoid generic sci-fi. However, the collective salvation through unity, while beautifully rendered, follows familiar narrative patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
