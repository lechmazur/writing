<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's tranquil perception drives discovery through active stillness—inverting assumptions to uncover deliberate erasure rather than passive tragedy. Her final act of stamping the Master Index demonstrates earned agency with clear cost (risking the dangerous ascent). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around motivation ("To give the silenced a syntax") that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught inversions ("alternative hypothesis") that build to a Resonant Reconfiguration where stillness transforms from surrender to testimony. The Master Index discovery reweights all prior anomalies into proof of deliberate burial. Cost is legible in the dangerous ascent ahead and the weight of accountability she now carries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drowned library constrains every choice—from navigating silt-choked aisles to discovering the brass-bound codex preserved by hidden vents. Sensory specificity ("salt and sweat," "moss-slick shelves") filtered through her perceptive lens. The environment literally preserves truth through architectural design, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking origins to witnessing deliberate erasure, with the Master Index revelation forcing her to become testimony-bearer. The "blackout" as suppression creates persistent pressure. Minor deduction for relatively safe investigation until the final ascent—the danger could have been more immediate throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete discovery: stillness as active preservation rather than passive decay. The Master Index's "we knew/They buried us anyway" crystallizes the central question about historical suppression without moralizing. The ink stamp transforms from ceremonial weight to accountability seal, recharging its meaning perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Controlled third-person limited with distinctive perceptual signature ("shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts"). Some elevated diction ("tactile anchor amid the muffled chaos") occasionally drifts from immediacy. The prose modulates well with discovery beats but includes several filter constructions that could be more direct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Truth, she knew, rarely roared—it seeped"). However, several abstract formulations ("To give the silenced a syntax," "purpose luminous") and some template-like parallel constructions in the middle section. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting with stacked modifiers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inverted investigation method (testing "alternative hypothesis" against architectural clues) offers fresh angle on archaeological discovery. The preserved Master Index through hidden vents is ingenious. Slight deduction for familiar underwater exploration setting, though the specific execution of stillness-as-preservation elevates it.</comment>
