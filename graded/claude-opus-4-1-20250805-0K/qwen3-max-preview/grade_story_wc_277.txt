I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor would, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heiress's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving truth against institutional erasure—with concrete embodiment through the telescope adjustments and pen nib handling. Her internal conflict between observation and intervention crystallizes in the "proof by contradiction" approach. The characterization loses some points for occasional diagnostic self-awareness ("solemn playfulness") and the slightly too-neat resolution of her grandfather's wisdom guiding her tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Causal lens with clear closure—the protagonist's intervention through documented evidence creates a Decisive Change that exposes the cover-up. The orientation anchors (observatory, after journalist's call) establish cleanly by ~100 words. Cost is visible in the "orbits of regret" and the price of constant vigilance. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical reveal of the archive's burning schedule feeling convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The modified telescope functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—she must use this specific vantage and tool to gather evidence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (brass cold, smoke patterns, city lights "smoldering like embers"). The observatory's height and isolation pressure her solitary stance. Loses points for some atmospheric description that doesn't directly pressure choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from the journalist's cryptic call to discovering the pattern of document destruction to taking decisive action. The dominant stake—exposing truth versus institutional silence—tightens when she realizes the "accident" timing correlates with the purge schedule. Agency manifests through her calculated intervention. Minor deduction for the resolution feeling slightly too smooth without visible immediate risk to her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring motif of orbits—both astronomical and metaphorical cycles of suppression and revelation. The "proof by contradiction" method embodies the thematic question about how truth survives erasure. The rosewood pen nib carries generational weight. Loses points for the slightly explicit thematic statement about "orbits are not prisons" at the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization through the heiress's perception. Prose rhythm modulates effectively during the observation sequence. Some elevated diction ("elliptical, inevitable") fits the character's education but occasionally drifts toward purple. The internal monologue maintains character-specific perception throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high in the telescope sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "smoldering like embers beneath a blanket of mist," some repetitive phrasing around "truth" and "silence," and occasional register drift into overly literary territory ("epitaph," "Q.E.D."). The metaphor density in places obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The modified telescope as a tool for urban surveillance rather than celestial observation offers a fresh angle. The "proof by contradiction" method for exposing cover-ups feels specific and earned. The generational aspect with the grandfather's pen nib adds depth. Loses points for some familiar elements (whistleblower story, corrupt archive) that aren't sufficiently transformed.</comment>
