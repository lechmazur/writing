<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The worker's transformation from technical repair to spiritual cartography is earned through concrete discovery, with her motivation shifting naturally from academic to arboreal to ultimately memorial. The final choice to become "cartographer of witnessed sorrow" carries visible cost (abandoning her original role) though some interiority relies on abstraction ("resonance" without sufficient embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the worker accepts a new role as memory-keeper, with cost visible in abandoning repair for witness. The sextant's transformation from broken to dream-projector drives the pivot naturally, though the astronomer's fate feels slightly convenient as explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains and enables brilliantly—moonlight literally heals the sextant, the tower's isolation enables discovery, and trees become active participants offering their stored memories. The storm-to-calm progression mirrors the internal journey, with sensory detail ("rain drummed the leaded windows," "mossy root") grounding the mystical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from mechanical repair to understanding grief's witnesses to accepting the role of memory-keeper, with the sextant's "overload" forcing the choice. The trees' active participation ("leaned toward her—not in threat, but recognition") escalates pressure effectively, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off beyond role abandonment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of trees as grief's witnesses, with the sextant measuring "quantified sorrow" literalized in the mapping of dreams onto natural forms. The final image of becoming "cartographer of witnessed sorrow" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, earning its wisdom through concrete discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with technical precision ("brass limbs," "calibrated face") shifting to poetic observation ("moonlight pooled like a blessing"). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical moments without losing the worker's practical grounding, though occasional abstractions ("mundane miracles") slightly weaken specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in discovery sequences ("how roots remember screams, how bark absorbs whispered confessions"). Some repetitive structures ("She saw how...How...How" tripling) and abstract phrases ("resonance," "mundane miracles") create minor drag, though the prose generally propels with purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical repair with arboreal memory-keeping feels genuinely fresh, transforming the grief-measurement concept through specific tree-human relationships. The astronomer's transformation into someone who "walked into the forest barefoot" to let trees take his sorrow offers a non-obvious resolution to overwhelming knowledge.</comment>
