<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The druid's transformation from guarded to revealed drives genuine change with visible cost through the flesh-eating plant's root system mapping her buried truths. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully as she simultaneously fears and needs the seed's revelation. The "ribs crack—not with pain, but release" moment embodies emotion perfectly without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the druid's transformation from guarded to revealed, with visible cost in her physical/emotional unbending. The accumulative/textural lens holds as expanding circles deepen pressure through layered revelations. Orientation anchors effectively (druid, cursed lake, after failed magic trick).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard vortex setting actively constrains choice—the druid must walk to its center and submit to the seed's process. "Petals like shards of stained glass" and "branches bent toward her, not to strike, but to witness" create vivid, purposeful sensory detail. The environment transforms causally with the protagonist's change, from frozen confessions to blooming stars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through expanding circles of revelation, each ring peeling back armor until "the final circle reached her heart." The dominant stake—confronting hidden truth versus remaining guarded—tightens meaningfully as roots map her buried memories. Cost is visible in the physical unbending and emotional exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: "Mirrors lie...They show surfaces polished for survival, not souls stripped raw for truth." The ending reweights everything—the vortex becomes compass, curse becomes method for healing others. No moralizing; the warlike serenity and unbending concept resonate through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: "cloak woven from thorn-vines and silence," "fortress of moss and marrow." Voice maintains lyric control under pressure without head-hopping. Rhythmic variation serves emotional beats, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("hymns of warriors who'd laid down arms").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "She walked toward the center, her guarded heart a fortress of moss and marrow." Some overwriting in metaphor density ("petals like shards of stained glass spiraling around her") but clarity remains. Minor template cadence in "She saw" repetition serves pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The flesh-eating plant as agent of truth rather than destruction offers fresh inflection on the element. "Unbending" as willow-like return to true shape transforms the expected. The synthesis of confession, mirror-truth, and expanding circles creates an inevitable-feeling resolution.</comment>
