<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from seeking lost things to understanding them as gifts shows earned change through concrete discovery. Her contradictory impulses (joy in loss, delight in vanishing) act simultaneously throughout, particularly when pressing seeds to skin triggers "giddy sorrow." The final choice to carry rather than solve mystery lands with visible cost—accepting incompleteness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught seed-to-emotion mechanism paying off through density increase toward the crater glass revelation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when she reframes disappearance as gift rather than loss, with cost visible in "wear the missing pieces as adornments, not wounds." Early orientation anchors who/where/what by paragraph 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The geode cave constrains movement and provides resources (aurora-lit walls, seed locations, crater glass) that enable the protagonist's discovery method. Environment directly shapes the final revelation—the crater glass at cave's heart holds the memories that transform her understanding. Vivid sensory work: "iridescent," "phosphorescent moss," "liquid honey" light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from discovering why paths disappear to understanding disappearance itself as intentional gift-giving. The crater glass vision sequence tightens pressure by forcing recognition that loss isn't tragedy but generosity. Cost appears when she must accept carrying mystery rather than solving it—foreclosing the certainty she initially sought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: seeds as "farewells," paths traded for "resonance." The final image of scattering "conjectures like confetti" offers resonant answer to the central question without stating moral. Subtext operates through the paradox "cheerful gloom" and the grandmother's lost voice informing method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: protagonist notices through emotion-transliteration, focusing on feeling over image ("not images, not words, but pure feeling"). Voice modulates from playful ("skipped barefoot") to reverent at crater glass to exuberant at closure. Lyric compression serves the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"salt-crusted skin" establishes character history while describing appearance. Some figurative density in peak moments ("like vines climbing forgotten walls") but pattern-taught and coherent. Minor repetition of "missing pieces" and "vanished" but serves accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-collection with emotion-transliteration creates non-obvious angle on loss/discovery narrative. The specific method (seeds to temple, feeling to words) and worldbuilding (Great Stillness, crater glass) avoid generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric structure and paradoxical tone heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
