<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from surrendering to chance to recognizing her agency through backwards prophecy creates genuine character movement with visible cost. Her internal contradictions (stellar doubt vs quiet enthusiasm) act simultaneously in scene, particularly during the static burst vision. The final choice to step forward without consulting lots represents earned change, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as the protagonist recognizes she's been guided by future selves, reweighting all prior lot-casting as agency rather than surrender. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as static bursts intensify toward the vision that triggers her stance crystallization. Cost is visible in her trembling recognition and the choice to abandon her surrender-based system. Minor orientation lag (who the survivors are) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck functions as more than backdrop—its cracked glass and honeyed light create atmospheric pressure while the coins serve as conduits for static bursts that constrain choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (tremor in molars, itch behind eyes). The amber star's dying light charges the final image. World-building coherence around the contraction creates believable constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning after universal collapse—deepens through the static burst that reveals her agency paradox, forcing her to choose between continued surrender or accepting purpose. The vision of herself with a child creates genuine pressure that narrows options. Cost appears in abandoning her lot-casting system. Escalation could be stronger; the middle lacks intermediate pressure points before the vision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of choice within determinism—every surrendered decision was already chosen by future selves. The coins' transformation from chance instruments to memory conduits creates resonant symbolism. The final declaration about being "the distillate" offers a non-literal answer to finding meaning post-collapse. Some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction but remain grounded in concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through bone-listening and static-feeling rather than conventional observation. Voice modulates effectively from meditative to urgent during the vision sequence. Free indirect style is clean with consistent thought formatting. Dialogue (limited but present) carries appropriate weight for the moment. Some diction occasionally drifts elevated ("stellar doubt pulsed behind her ribs") but generally maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, particularly in the vision sequence. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some metaphorical density borders on over-writing ("stellar doubt that pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar") and occasional abstract passages slow momentum. The final image lands with clarity and power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy concept offers fresh perspective on determinism—future selves remembering and guiding present choices inverts typical time-loop narratives. The specific detail of coins as memory conduits and lot-casting as disguised agency transforms familiar post-apocalyptic elements. The universe contraction provides unique world-logic. Risk-taking in the non-linear revelation structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
