<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to preserve forgotten names through ritual transformation is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied emotion ("snowmelt ardor—that fierce, thawing tenderness"). The internal journey from "hollow gods for hollow temples" to meaningful preservation shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional peaks ("technically gentle" repeated without deeper exploration).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance building to a Conceptual Repricing where preservation shifts from vaults to vibration. The closure lands with clear cost—the narrator's unsigned work and empty hands signify sacrifice for collective memory. Orientation anchors (icebound sanctum, lost wax caster) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum functions as both literal workspace and metaphysical crucible, with ice-prisms threading light that mirrors the narrator's threading of memory into metal. Sensory specificity excels ("aurora ripple overhead—green, violet, silver") and the rope's physical properties constrain the casting process. The setting's eventual transformation to meadow charges the final vision of preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names as "living resonance"—deepens through the casting process, with each stage (melting, pouring, cooling, breaking) tightening options toward the final act of embedding memory in bronze. The three-day cooling period and material constraints (specific alloys, reclaimed wax) create genuine pressure. Slightly lower score as the internal conflict could show more simultaneous contradiction during the work itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of materials—rope to helix, forgotten melodies to liturgy, ice to meadow—without explicit moralizing. The final image of children hearing ancestral lullabies through bronze offers a non-literal answer about how memory persists through physical vibration rather than archives. "This is preservation" lands as earned wisdom from concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout with lyric compression that serves the meditative pace ("I illuminate not with flame or lantern, but by reconfiguring the braids"). Voice maintains consistency through emotional peaks, though some passages edge toward elevated register ("snowmelt ardor"). The taught pattern of ritual description pays off in the final transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions (action + atmosphere + meaning). Some repetitive structures appear ("I [verb]" patterns in middle section) and occasional abstract phrasing ("technically gentle" used twice without variation). Strong propulsion in the casting sequence and powerful closing image sequence from "I pack my tools" onward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting with memory preservation through sound creates an original angle on grief and remembrance. The specific detail of the punched card's holes becoming name-syllables and the rope's braids holding centuries of chants shows genuine innovation. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
