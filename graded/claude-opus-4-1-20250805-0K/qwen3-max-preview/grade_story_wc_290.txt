<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction that intensifies through embodied reactions ("sweat beading," "walls seeming to lean closer") and drives her climactic choice to enter the narrowest passage. The transformation from fear to liberation is earned through concrete struggle, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("cartographer of possibility").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's embodiment of the key transforms her relationship to space itself, with visible cost in her terror during the narrow passage and payoff in the widened return path. The harmonic cipher setup pays off precisely when she becomes the key, though early world-building about "spatial mutiny" takes time to crystallize.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The claustrophobic passages and self-playing organ create visceral setting that directly constrains Elara's choices, particularly when "stone scraping her shoulders" forces her to confront her core fear. The shadowed nexus and moving constellations enhance atmosphere effectively, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("silvered bone").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds from external exploration to internal transformation as the passages tighten and Elara must choose between retreat and her mission, with clear cost when she "squeezed her eyes shut, chanting coordinates like prayers." The organ's pull creates coherent pressure, though the resolution's ease (widened passage) slightly undercuts the established danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of liberation through embracing contradiction emerges organically as Elara discovers "spatial mutiny was not chaos—it was liberation," reweighting her claustrophobia as the very quality needed to understand rebellious space. The final image of her as "weaver of rebellious space" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scholarly precision ("harmonic cipher," "Chamber of Echoed Intent") with lyrical perception ("dust motes that danced like forgotten spirits"), though occasional purple prose intrudes ("silvered bone," "liquid geometry"). POV control remains steady with clean free indirect style throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but figurative density occasionally obscures clarity ("blueprint of spatial mutiny—the rebellion of space against its own boundaries"). Some passages edge toward overwriting with stacked modifiers, and the abstract ending phrases ("cartographer of possibility") lack the story's earlier concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a claustrophobic explorer pursuing spatial rebellion offers genuine paradox, and the self-playing organ as guardian creates memorable atmosphere. The transformation of the key from object to embodied truth provides a non-obvious resolution, though some world-building elements feel derivative of portal fantasy conventions.</comment>
