<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chimera twin concept drives genuine internal contradiction through the protagonist's dual nature, with embodied uncertainty about taking back the name Lirien. The final choice to embrace "both/neither/all" carries visible cost through the ship's physical trembling and her becoming "lighter yet heavier." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("blissfully aberrant") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accepting the name Lirien transforms her state with felt cost ("lighter yet heavier"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories build toward the garden revelation. Minor opacity in the early carnival ship setup delays full orientation, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden of forgotten names functions as micro-setting that constrains the crucial choice, with names as physical fruit the protagonist must decide to take. Vivid sensory work throughout ("oil-slick puddles reflected constellations that didn't exist above"). The ship's physical transformation at closure directly responds to her choice, though some middle passages lean descriptive without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming identity versus fracturing further—deepens through the mirror maze showing alternate selves and culminates in the tangible choice at the garden. Cost is visible when taking Lirien makes her "lighter yet heavier" and the ship recognizes her. The escalation could tighten more decisively in the middle third where exploration sometimes drifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of fragmented identity emerges through concrete images (mismatched eyes, mirror reflections, dangling names) rather than statement. The final acceptance of paradox ("I am both/neither/all") resonantly answers whether wholeness requires singular identity. "Trapped freedom...if you chose the bars" offers genuine complexity without resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with selective attention to decay and transformation ("carousel horses frozen mid-gallop under tarps slick with mildew"). Voice maintains lyric consistency through compression and pattern. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("constellations that didn't exist above") but rhythm generally serves pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the garden sequence. Minor figurative excess in places ("groaned like a dying beast") and occasional abstraction ("trapped freedom defined the air"). The prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments, though some descriptive passages could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chimera twin as identity-discoverer rather than monster offers fresh angle on multiplicity. The garden of forgotten names as physical space where identities grow like plants transforms abstract concept into tangible choice. Risk-taking in the non-linear memory structure and acceptance of paradox over resolution elevates stakes.</comment>
