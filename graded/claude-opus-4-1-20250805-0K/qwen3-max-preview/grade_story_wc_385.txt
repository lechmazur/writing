<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The singer's motivation to understand echo-bearers is grounded in concrete discovery (the shell's whispers, entity revelation) with embodied responses like "throat raw, soul lighter." Internal conflict shows beautifully in her choice to sing rather than destroy, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("echoes were echoes because someone needed them to be heard twice").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the entity transforms from predator to listener, with visible cost in the singer's raw throat and the returned resonance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through progressive shell revelations. Orientation anchors solidly (canyon, singer, starlight) though the "serpentine nexus" remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon-as-acoustic-space constrains the singer's methods and the shell functions as micro-setting that guides pitch "into frequencies that unraveled knots." Strong sensory work with "wind-carved hollows" and "spiraling rock arches like sleeping serpents," though the nexus itself lacks concrete detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the shell's progressive disclosures revealing deeper layers of the echo-theft, culminating in confronting the entity. The singer's agency drives the resolution through her choice to sing rather than destroy. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and emotional weight, though the entity's transformation feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of stolen resonance and unfinished emotional business, with the final image of the entity "no longer feeding, only listening" offering a non-literal answer about grief and witness. The shell's silence at closure effectively reweights its earlier whispers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("canyon echo singer," "reed-blown melancholy") and controlled psychic distance. Some passages drift into elevated register inconsistent with the intimate POV ("frequencies only the richly perceptive could feel vibrating in their marrow"), and occasional filter-verb clusters dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control in passages like "She sang of children who never got to say goodbye" but hampered by abstract loops ("echoes were not reflections but residues"), elevated diction drift ("serpentine nexus," "emotional payload"), and some template cadence in the middle revelations. Information density is high when concrete but dulled by philosophical abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-as-emotional-residue with the entity feeding on grief creates an original metaphysical ecology. The specific detail of the mute child delivering the shell "wrapped in salt-crusted silk" and the singer's choice to heal rather than destroy show genuine ingenuity beyond template responses.</comment>
