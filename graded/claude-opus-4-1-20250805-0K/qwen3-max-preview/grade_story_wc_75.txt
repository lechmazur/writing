<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to rescue dying arts drives concrete micro-choices throughout (bread-baking ritual, documenting flickers of courage), with internal complexity shown through her shift from searching for ghosts to framing living moments. The transformation from museum guide to cultural healer is earned through accumulated actions, though some interior passages lean toward summary rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's transformation from frozen grief to active art-making, with visible cost in the "daily kneading of hope into dough." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered artistic revivals. Minor orientation delays (grotto's exact nature) and some causality softness in middle transitions prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively constrains and enables choices—the waterfall's roar necessitates the hidden alcove discovery, damp stone preserves etchings, stalactites become natural stage lights. "Rosewater dread" transforms from decay-marker to anticipation-scent, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout despite the complex limestone architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual artistic preservation to communal renaissance, with the bread ritual forcing increasingly vulnerable artistic expressions (boy's drum, cracked flute, wire lyre). The transformation carries felt cost in "trembling fingers" and tears, though middle-section pressure could tighten further between bread-making and drum discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bread-as-mnemonic-architecture metaphor and the lens's ghost/living duality, culminating in "We are not preserving art. We are becoming it." The recurring motifs (emerald lens, bread shapes, water) accumulate meaning rather than merely repeating, though the final direct statement slightly undercuts the otherwise implicit resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's cultured background, with distinctive perceptual signature (seeing vibrations ripple, framing moments through opera glass). Some passages drift toward curatorial exposition ("displaced persons from drowned coastal towns"), but rhythmic control strengthens during peak moments like the drum scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("bread shaped like initials—her grandmother's recipe, kneaded with lavender and grief"). Some metaphor density in early sections ("moss on its damp stone arches," "echoes remembered songs") and occasional register elevation ("mnemonic architecture") create minor friction without harming closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate refugee narrative with art-as-survival-mechanism offers fresh specificity, particularly the bread-alphabet as edible archive. The transformation of the opera glass from ghost-seeking to life-framing tool shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and extended metaphor system heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
