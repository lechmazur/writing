<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glassblower's motivation to abandon control systems and create safe spaces for inquiry drives consistent choices throughout, with her ritualistic narration revealing character through action. The final choice to leave vessels behind for others shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("thoughtfully spirited") that could be more embodied, though the contradiction between destruction (melting tools) and creation (glass spheres) works well.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens with density increasing through ritual narration and glass-sphere placement, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the abandoned vessels become sanctuaries. The cost is legible in her leaving without witnessing results—a genuine sacrifice of control. Orientation anchors cleanly (glassblower, control room, post-Frost thaw). The child finding the sphere provides closure that reweights the entire ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The melting ice and abandoned control room effectively constrain choices—she must work with salvaged materials and accept the building's decay. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (breath curling, drip-drip-drip, rainbow shards on metal). The glass spheres function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Some passages lean abstract when concrete detail would strengthen the world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating spaces for inquiry versus maintaining control—deepens through her ritual narration and placement of spheres. Escalation reads through accumulation: each sphere placed raises the commitment to abandonment. The cost manifests in leaving her work incomplete, trusting others to find meaning. Pressure could tighten more explicitly in middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between control systems and glass vessels, with the bookmark-in-glass serving as a concrete anchor for knowledge persistence. The final image of a child finding the sphere offers a non-literal answer about how transformation happens through discovery rather than instruction. Subtext operates well through her dramatic narration of mundane acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through ritualistic narration and selective perception (seeing furnace memories in melting glass). Some register elevation in philosophical passages ("weightless gravity of a question") strains against the otherwise grounded voice. The dramatic narration technique is taught early and sustained. Perceptual signature strong when focused on glass and craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rainbow shards now danced on metal") but suffers from repetitive sentence structures and abstract phrasing ("thoughtfully spirited" appears twice, "quietly, melting" forces alliteration). Template cadence in the middle spheres section (-0.6). Information density varies; strongest in concrete craft moments, weakest in abstract reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of glassblowing craft with post-apocalyptic setting and ritualistic performance creates genuine freshness. The concept of abandoning control systems to create "safe zones for inquiry" transforms familiar post-disaster tropes. The dramatic narration of mundane acts as sacred ceremony shows risk-taking that mostly succeeds. Some safety in the redemptive ending prevents higher scoring.</comment>
