<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation intensifies from archive exploration to ancestral recognition, with contradictory impulses (destroyer/savior) acting simultaneously in the tapestry discovery scene. The transformation from "lending library arsonist" to "archivist of the unspoken" is earned through concrete discoveries, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("analytical intuition" as survival trait lacks specific embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the protagonist stepping into light as "curator of the scorched and sacred," with visible cost in her criminal status above versus prophetic role below. The accumulative/textural lens holds as discoveries build density toward the archive's singing response, teaching its pattern early through "volcanic tenderness" and paying off in the merger of destruction/preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive functions as active setting—dust shifts, doors sigh open, glyphs glow at her touch—constraining her path through seven days of searching and directly enabling the final transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects her arsonist past ("patterns in smoke, charred spines") and the "petrified ink and salt" creates lived-in specificity that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to ancestral covenant as the tapestry reveals her face/lineage, with the archive's responsive tremors and opening passages tightening pressure toward the final chamber. The cost is legible in her acceptance of criminal status to fulfill the promise, though the middle section could sharpen the specific obstacles she overcomes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the "volcanic tenderness" metaphor—destruction that preserves—without stating its moral, as her arson past recontextualizes into memory preservation. The final image of her as "answer to a question no one living had dared to ask" offers a resonant non-literal response to the forgetting/remembrance tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how she reads "patterns in smoke" and calls preservation "volcanic tenderness," with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the tapestry recognition. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("throat of the earth," "fissure, mercy flowed") that slightly exceeds the established voice, but rhythm effectively modulates with discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("volcanic tenderness" simultaneously characterizes setting, theme, and psychology), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("analytical intuition," "institutional indifference"). The "we promised you would remember" inscription and singing archive payoff land with strong propulsion, but occasional register elevation ("curry of the unspoken") creates mild friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lending library arsonist who burns to reveal truth rather than destroy is a fresh angle, and the vandalized self-portrait as ancestral/future echo offers genuine conceptual originality. The synthesis of destruction/preservation through "volcanic tenderness" feels specific and earned, though some elements (lost civilization, chosen one prophecy) lean on familiar frameworks.</comment>
