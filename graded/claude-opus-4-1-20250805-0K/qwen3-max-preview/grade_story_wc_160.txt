<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The machinist's internal contradiction between rigid control and fluid mercy drives genuine tension, with embodied trembling and palm-pressing grounding her emotional state. Her "slyly heartfelt" methods show consistent character through indirect action rather than declaration. The final choice to embed compassion into maintenance logs demonstrates values hierarchy with clear cost—risking her position for downstream communities.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through surveyor's chain measurements, harmonic resonance discovery, and final integration into floodgate systems—each layer reweighting the central stake of compassion versus control. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she commits to secretly embedding mercy into mechanical systems, with visible cost in her acceptance that "the world would never know." The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by ~100 words and maintains coherent causality throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater's acoustics, harmonic frequencies, and volcanic breath directly constrain her method—she must match the building's resonance to reveal inscriptions, making setting essential to discovery. Sensory selection reflects her engineer's priorities: measuring erosion patterns, feeling geothermal warmth, hearing stone's "exhalations." The dormant volcano setting charges the final image as she steps "into the light" carrying ancient wisdom to modern machinery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through discovery sequence: adhesive analysis leads to amphitheater, chain measurements reveal relief carving, harmonic resonance exposes hidden equations—each narrowing her path toward integrating compassion into rigid systems. The dominant stake (mechanistic control vs. fluid mercy) tightens when she discovers the covenant that "control must be tempered with compassion." Cost appears in her trembling acceptance of working in secret, though agency could be stronger in driving discoveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the surveyor's chain linking memory to distance, the amphitheater amplifying both verdicts and mercy, and equations disguised as poetry—all particulars that resist abstraction. The final image of "mercy moving the gears" offers a non-literal answer to reconciling opposing values without moralizing. Subtext operates through the envelope's "bergamot and regret," the relief of woman feeding fish, and her smile while copying symbols "knowing overseers would call it madness."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows engineer's attention to compounds, measurements, and structural metaphors ("stone ribs," "skeleton of sleeping leviathan"), with poetic elevation that fits her role bridging technical and mystical. Psychic distance modulates effectively from distant observation to intimate palm-pressing. Some register elevation in peak moments ("cicada wings," "caramel smear") enriches rather than disrupts voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"each link calibrated not just for distance but for memory" layers technical and emotional registers. Rhythm varies naturally between long accumulative sentences and short declarations. Minor repetition of "slyly heartfelt" and some elevated diction ("dormant volcano's warmth seep into her bones") occasionally slows momentum but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of flood control engineering with archaeological mystery and encrypted compassion creates non-obvious angle—engineers who "wept as they diverted rivers" inverts expected emotional distance. The amphitheater as tuning fork for mechanical systems and "equations disguised as poetry" transform both technical and mystical tropes. Risk-taking in the extended metaphorical framework heightens rather than obscures stakes.</comment>
