<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The janitor's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—his reverence for dissolution versus institutional indifference—with the comet's surrender serving as earned epiphany. His choice to honor vulnerability through witnessing carries visible emotional cost (tears, recognition). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("flourishing stillness") that could be more concretely dramatized in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the comet's efflorescence creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the janitor's practice of witnessing. Cost is felt through tears of recognition and the contrast between archived nothing and experienced everything. The orientation anchors clearly (station, Andromeda Drift, janitor role) and causality holds through textural deepening rather than plot turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final witnessing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from deck to scope to console. The station's analog character and "wind-chime sensors" create lived-in specificity. Setting enables the central choice to witness rather than record.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the comet's arrival, escalating from routine meteor tracking to witnessing unprecedented dissolution. The janitor's agency manifests in choosing presence over protocol. Cost is legible in the gap between what sensors register (nothing) and what witnessing yields (perfect peace).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges pristinely through the comet's "offering" and the janitor's recognition—vulnerability as strength made visible without declaration. The final "Thank you for remembering how to be still" resonates as earned wisdom from concrete experience. Subtext operates beautifully in the contrast between institutional blindness and personal revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters cosmic phenomena through custodial metaphor (swept star-dust, benediction strokes). Voice modulates effectively from meditative observation to breathless recognition. Minor register elevation in abstractions like "flourishing stillness" occasionally pulls against the grounded custodial perspective but rhythm control under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sky wept embers," "ink in water") with strong information density. However, abstract phrases like "flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," and "rhythm of deep space breathing" create occasional opacity. Some filter-verb clustering ("He stood," "He knelt," "He rose") in the witnessing sequence dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The janitor-astronomer synthesis feels fresh and inevitable—menial labor as spiritual practice. The comet's dissolution into "efflorescence" rather than explosion transforms expected cosmic violence. Risk-taking in the quiet, contemplative approach to sci-fi heightens thematic stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
