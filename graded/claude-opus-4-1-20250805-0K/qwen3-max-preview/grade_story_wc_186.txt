I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category accordingly.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered images and memories toward a resonant reconfiguration where the custodian realizes she's been "summoned" as a "receiver" for echoes.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("wept—not from sorrow, but from thistle-blown hope") and a meaningful change from wanderer to purposeful keeper. The protagonist's motivation intensifies believably through discovery, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("threads that tied random moments into tapestries of meaning").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost—the custodian accepts her role as "receiver" with the weight of understanding her summoning. The accumulative structure coheres through star-alignment to vision to self-recognition, with the prism as persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity ("boots crunching over powdered silica," "low harmonic rose, trembling through floor and bone"). The glass pavilion functions as active setting that constrains action and charges the final image through its "lullaby of refracted light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation—from proving patterns exist to becoming the pattern's keeper. The prism's fragility ("One misaligned star, one tremor in the glass") creates genuine tension that pays off when she succeeds in receiving the echoes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of aligning stars to reveal connections. The final realization that "even broken things can rekindle wonder" resonates without moralizing, earned through specific dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("a shard of hush, not silence, but the pregnant pause between heartbeats"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature, though occasional elevation ("luminous weave") slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in peak moments ("The pavilion's hum deepened, became a chorus"). Minor repetitive structures ("She had," "She knew") create slight template cadence but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with mystical technology and memory-as-physical-phenomenon. The concept of "retrocognitive blessing" and seeing "cause in effect" offers genuine originality, though some metaphors trend familiar.</comment>
