<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to foster interspecies respect through deliberate calm in his final months is clear and consistent, driving concrete micro-choices like unwinding the sparrow strand by strand. His internal state—"brazen calm" replacing fear with purpose—manifests through embodied actions rather than labels. The character change from living to dying happens off-page, but his stance crystallization (choosing monument over decay) earns its cost through accumulated specifics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through copper-guided geometries, creature interactions, and architectural evolution until the final burial beneath the Whisper Arch reweights the entire orchard as living cathedral. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the diary bound to oak and children learning "respect not by lecture, but by living inside the design." Cost is felt through Arlen's shallow breath, final sigh, and the permanence of his absence while his design persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard's living stone pillars "pulsed with moss and root" create a micro-setting where copper wire becomes architectural medium, constraining how Arlen must work with rather than against natural growth. Sensory details like "mist clung to the orchard like a veil" and "scales gleaming like living coins" serve the interspecies theme. The Whisper Arch where "bees learned to navigate its curves without collision" charges the final burial site with earned significance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating a monument to interspecies respect before death—faces one meaningful deepening when the sparrow incident proves "respect isn't earned by dominance" but through belonging in the design. This realization shifts Arlen's methods from documentation to active remodeling. Terminal diagnosis provides persistent time pressure, though no on-page reversal tests his commitment; the cost accumulates through his declining breath and eventual death beneath his creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: copper conducting "intention" not just electricity, creatures adapting to wire-woven spaces, the diary weathering but remaining legible. The story resists moralizing except for one explicit statement about respect and dominance. The final image of sparrows nesting in copper arms embodies the theme of architecture as invitation rather than imposition, with new generations learning through inhabitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with selective perception—Arlen notices how "vines threaded through fissures" and "roots cradled stones without cracking them." Voice modulates appropriately from technical precision ("copper-guided oaks") to lyrical reflection ("pulse fading into the rhythm of the earth"). However, some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("Over the years...biologists studied"), and filter-heavy constructions occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines like "architecture not built, but coaxed" doing multiple jobs, but template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("Children brought him acorns; elders brought tea"). Several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "respect isn't earned by dominance" followed immediately by proving "you belong in the design" restates without advancing. The prose achieves moments of excellence ("a sigh lost in the rustle of leaves") but accumulates enough minor redundancies to limit the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The copper-wire-as-growth-guide method offers a fresh angle on cultivation, transforming the dying-gardener trope through architectural ambition. Specific details like lizards sunning on copper branches "like living coins" avoid generic nature writing. However, the terminal diagnosis setup and wise-dying-man arc follow familiar patterns without sufficient transformation; the interspecies respect theme, while earnestly rendered, doesn't achieve conceptual breakthrough.</comment>
