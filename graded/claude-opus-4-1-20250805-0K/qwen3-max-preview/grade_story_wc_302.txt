<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's internal experience is richly embodied through concrete sensory details (glyphs blooming on skin, scent pulling her into memory) and her micro-choices reveal values under pressure. The recursive self-discovery at the mirror creates genuine contradiction between individual quest and collective pattern, though the final transformation into "the archive" edges toward abstraction without fully embodying the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes the archive itself, with visible cost in the bone stylus scarring and the loss of individual identity. The recursive structure teaches its pattern early through the "cyclically reversed" stacks and pays off when she discovers all seekers are iterations of the same journey. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of becoming "the archive" without more concrete embodiment of what this transformation entails.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library setting functions as active constraint—shelves that curve like vertebrae, mist that thickens into sentences, and the recursive architecture that forces her to retrace altered paths. The watch and bone stylus serve as micro-settings that directly shape her tactics and choices. The mirror at the end charges the entire space with new meaning as a self-perpetuating loop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each discovery alters the archive retroactively, forcing constant adaptation. The watch's behavior (spinning wildly, freezing, going silent) tracks rising stakes effectively. The final revelation that she is one of many iterations crystallizes the true cost—not finding knowledge but becoming it—though the transformation could be more viscerally rendered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of unspoken words as physical spaces and scars. The recursive structure embodies the theme of seeking what cannot be directly articulated. The final image of becoming the archive offers a resonant answer about the cost of pursuing forbidden knowledge, though it risks slight abstraction in the transformation moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical compression ("mist thickened into sentences," "footfalls echoed before they were made"). The prose maintains consistent dream-logic while remaining legible, and the perceptual signature stays unique throughout. Slight register elevation in places ("propagation delays," "recursive loop") fits the metaphysical setting without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—the watch description simultaneously establishes object, history, and current sensation. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor template moments ("She stepped through," "She lifted," "She did not vanish") in the closing sequence, but the pattern feels intentional rather than artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a library where unspoken words exist as navigable spaces between books is genuinely fresh. The recursive structure where all seekers are the same journey cleverly subverts quest narrative expectations. The bone stylus that uses the seeker's own blood for ink adds visceral specificity to what could have been abstract.</comment>
