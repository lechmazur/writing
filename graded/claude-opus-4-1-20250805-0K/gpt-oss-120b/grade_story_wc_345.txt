<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's altruistic nature drives the collective action, but she remains ethereal and passive—more catalyst than character with internal stakes. The villagers function as a unified collective without individual contradiction or cost. Old Mara and the unnamed child provide texture but lack embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the bell-ringing climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community commits to seasonal repetition, though the cost remains abstract ("brambled hope" rather than specific sacrifice). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with planet, orchards, and ghost established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches that sing creates a distinctive otherworld. The "nebula of respite" as fireflies and vapor above apple trees offers vivid, purposeful imagery. The bell constrains the central action and the setting actively participates through the arches' responsive pulsing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening hope through collective action—is signaled early but lacks concrete opposition or cost. The bell-ringing succeeds without complication or trade-off. While the nebula brightens and arches pulse in response, no option forecloses and no price is paid beyond gathering effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of community transformation from "strangers" to "family" emerges through accumulated action and the bell's resonance. The final commitment to seasonal repetition offers a non-literal answer about sustained collective effort. However, the resolution tends toward the saccharine with "brambled hope" lacking genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The omniscient voice maintains consistent distance with lyrical descriptions like "brambled hope that twined through their hearts." POV remains stable without head-hopping. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature and occasionally drifts into abstraction ("tangled optimism that grew stronger").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or action. Minor issues include abstract phrases ("brambled hope," "tangled optimism") and slight repetition of "nebula of respite" without evolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fusion of ghost, orchards, and singing rock arches creates an original setting. The "nebula of respite" as fireflies above apple trees offers fresh imagery. The butterfly garden watering bell as community ritual instrument shows creative synthesis, though the resolution plays safely within uplift conventions.</comment>
