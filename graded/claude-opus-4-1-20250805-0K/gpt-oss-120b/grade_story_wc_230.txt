<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to transform private pain into communal healing is clear and consistent, with her involuntary truthfulness creating genuine constraint. The final choice to cultivate collective seeing is earned through prior causality. However, internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene—her rational forager identity and empathy-building mission never truly clash during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the glass eye becoming a communal mirror, with visible cost in the smugglers' forced self-confrontation. The causal lens holds as Mara's plan unfolds through deliberate steps. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The "fractured grace" bookending and orchard transformation land with felt consequence, though the smugglers' instant conversion strains believability slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard functions as both setting and pressure system—storms, slick surfaces, and precarious positioning constrain movement and choices. Sensory details like "sheets of rain," "leaf-dust like confetti," and moss-covered hollows are vivid and purposeful. The glass eye's placement in the hollowed log uses micro-setting effectively. The orchard's final transformation into a truth-cultivation space charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—using the glass eye to create psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when Mara must reveal her true intentions. Her agency drives the escalation through hiding the eye and confronting the smugglers. However, the smugglers' immediate capitulation lacks earned resistance, and the conflict resolves too smoothly without testing Mara's commitment through meaningful opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glass eye's reflective power becoming a metaphor for communal truth-seeing after the empathy virus. The final image of continued tending resonates without stating a moral. The concept of "fractured grace" threads throughout, and psychological safety growing "not from the absence of pain, but from the courage to reflect it together" offers genuine complexity without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The first-person voice maintains consistency with methodical observation befitting a truffle forager, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured grace," "covenant of empathy") that strains the established voice. No dialogue weakens character distinction. Perceptual signature shows in mycological attention to moss and spores, but syntax lacks rhythmic variety under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("hanging orchard swaying like a broken cathedral of fruit") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("old sorrow," "fragile safety blooming") and occasional register drift. Template cadence appears in "I saw...My plan required...I trekked" progression. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story but some philosophical passages ("In the fractured grace of that moment") slow momentum without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard as post-virus sanctuary and the glass eye as involuntary truth mirror offer fresh angles on familiar healing narratives. The truffle forager's methodical approach to emotional reconstruction feels specific. However, the empathy virus backstory and instant smuggler conversion follow predictable patterns, and the resolution's tidiness reduces risk-taking potential.</comment>
