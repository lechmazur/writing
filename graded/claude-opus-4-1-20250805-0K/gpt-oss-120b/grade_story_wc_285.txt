<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to "distill the river's memory" remains abstract throughout, never crystallizing into concrete want versus need. The yarn needle carries emotional weight but doesn't compel specific choices under pressure. Internal conflict exists only as vague "hope over old regret" without embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost—Arlen simply rides away feeling peaceful after the fog lifts. The "promise" accepting and "secret woven" remain conceptually vague without dramatized change. Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fog and river create atmospheric density that supports the meditative tone. The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, constraining Arlen's ritual of "stitching invisible threads." Sensory detail emphasizes mist and sound effectively though the village remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs—Arlen waits, meditates, then departs when fog lifts naturally. The dominant stake of understanding the river never faces opposition or requires trade-offs. Agency reduces to passive awareness without cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The palimpsest metaphor of layered memory resonates through river/fog imagery but resolves into abstract "simple truth" without specificity. Theme emerges through accumulation rather than earned insight, though the layering motif creates some coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm, particularly in "spindrift serenity" and "percolate" phrasings. POV remains stable in third-limited. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("palimpsest promise," "turbulent chorus") that strains against the coachman character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose maintains atmospheric momentum but suffers from abstraction loops ("distill complexity into essence," "simple truth," "quiet answer"). Template cadence appears in "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphor of stitching/distilling/percolating weakens coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The meditation-at-crossing frame offers little transformation of familiar contemplative tropes. Specific details like rain gutters ticking provide texture but the core arc of achieving understanding through patient waiting remains generic.</comment>
