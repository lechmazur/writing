I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marek's character shows consistent traits (reticent, observant) but his motivation for the ritual lacks causal grounding—we never understand why he performs these specific actions. The "warmly observant" trait manifests through sensory detail, yet his internal conflict remains abstract ("luminescent ache of memory"). The final "his heart alight" reversal feels unearned without prior emotional causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to establish clear closure with visible cost. The ritual's purpose and mechanics remain opaque—why does stacking stones create a "network of hope"? The magical realism elements (glowing stones, pulsing spiral) appear without established rules. Most critically, the ending "he returned, his heart alight" provides no legible change or cost, merely asserting transformation without dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting effectively creates atmosphere through specific details ("iron ribs," "broken panes"). Sensory selection appropriately narrows during the ritual sequence. However, the spatial choreography becomes vague during the stone-stacking, and the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—Marek could perform this ritual anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No clear escalation occurs under any lens. The dominant stake—preserving safety through the ritual—never faces opposition or complication. Marek performs his actions without obstacle, cost, or meaningful choice. The story lacks pressure points where options narrow or deepen; everything proceeds as intended without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of preserving hope/safety through symbolic acts emerges through imagery rather than assertion, but remains surface-level. The "anonymous letter chain" concept introduces complexity but never develops beyond metaphor. The final image attempts resonance but lacks earned weight since we haven't seen the cost of maintaining or losing this "chain."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Marek's contemplative nature. POV remains stable in third-limited. However, the narrative voice drifts into overwrought territory ("luminescent ache," "quiet sentinel") without earning this elevation through dramatized emotion. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Significant overwriting issues throughout: "luminescent ache" appears twice, mixed metaphors proliferate ("bottle the feeling," "lighthouse for hearts"), and abstract phrasing dominates ("collective memory of those who dared to care"). Template cadence emerges in the stone-stacking sequence ("He pressed...and etched," "The third stone held"). The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, creating opacity around key actions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of messages in lighthouse stones offers modest freshness, and the "lighthouse for hearts" metaphor provides a non-obvious angle. However, execution remains generic—the emotional beats follow predictable patterns without specific detail that would distinguish this from other lighthouse-keeper stories. The magical realism elements feel borrowed rather than transformed.</comment>
