I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied choices (walking patterns that spell words) and her transformation from crisis actor to historian carries genuine weight. The "benevolently ruthless" paradox manifests in action. However, interiority relies on abstract labels ("quiet charge," "silent pact") rather than visceral embodiment, and the nomadic penumbra's agency muddles whether change comes from Mira's choices or external forces.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation into "historian of small gestures," with visible cost in accepting this burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns of walking accumulate meaning toward the scroll's revelation. However, the penumbra's role creates mild causality confusion, and while the interregnum context is mentioned, its specific pressure on Mira's choices remains vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions beyond mere backdrop—its echoes, marble surfaces, and spatial choreography constrain Mira's actions and enable her word-spelling method. The "luminous absence" of missing pawns creates visual specificity. Minor deduction for the penumbra's physics remaining inconsistent (how does a shadow "curl around" a scroll?).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory of small gestures during crisis—remains coherent throughout. Mira's pattern-walking creates tangible pressure that unlocks the scroll compartment. However, escalation plateaus after the scroll discovery; the second pattern ("heal") lacks the causal weight of the first, and the penumbra's assistance reduces Mira's agency in the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor—missing pawns representing overlooked acts of courage—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Mira as historian with the penumbra following offers resonant closure. The piece successfully resists tidy resolution, though the "heal" sequence feels slightly forced compared to the stronger "remember what fell" pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the gallery setting, with selective perception focused on architectural and light details. The prose rhythm modulates effectively during pattern-walking sequences. However, some phrases drift toward purple prose ("vaulted whispering gallery, where light fell in thin ribbons"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "to unbind the story...to let the memory flow" restates the same intent. Abstract phrasing like "tentative interregnum" and "luminous absence" occasionally obscures concrete action, though the pattern-walking sequences maintain clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of recording "missing pawns" during political upheaval offers fresh perspective on crisis memory. Mira's method of walking words into dust is genuinely inventive. The synthesis of crisis actor becoming real survivor who documents others' survival gestures feels earned, though the nomadic penumbra's role trends toward convenient mysticism rather than grounded originality.</comment>
