I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory accumulation and pattern intensification toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator accepts the role of guardian for vulnerable voices.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as "contact tracer for hearts" is established but relies on conceptual declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The final acceptance of duty carries some weight, though the transformation from curiosity to commitment lacks intermediate struggle. Internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator commits to guarding echoes, with felt cost in accepting responsibility for "vulnerable voices still whispering." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details cascade toward the final image. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, lacking a concrete price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium setting actively shapes the narrative through its "vaulted corridors" and "sealed alcove," providing both atmosphere and constraint. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the interplay of mist, violet light, and marble. The environment participates in closure as "the city beyond was awash with faint drumming."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density as the narrator follows electromagnetic pulses deeper into the atrium, culminating in the choir's resonance. The dominant stake of preserving vulnerable voices intensifies adequately. However, the lack of genuine opposition or complication limits the pressure's force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete pursuit of preserving memory and voice beyond death. The concept of "incidental heroism" arising from "persistently curious" investigation avoids explicit moralizing. The final image of the restored photograph as "beacon for vulnerable voices" resonates without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, though it occasionally drifts toward purple prose ("cartographer of sighs"). POV remains stable and controlled. The perceptual signature of someone attuned to electromagnetic pulses and hidden frequencies is distinctive but sometimes overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates rhythmic variety and atmospheric density but suffers from overwriting in places ("reeling hush," "fog of oblivion"). Some metaphors strain credibility ("contact tracer for hearts"). Information density is moderate; several passages could be compressed without loss. The piece avoids major loops but indulges in ornamental language that occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of tracing electromagnetic echoes from a hearing aid to recover a dead singer's voice offers a fresh angle on memory preservation. The synthesis of technology and emotion feels specific. However, the execution relies on familiar tropes of the sensitive investigator discovering hidden truths.</comment>
