<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to foster peace through "linking absences" drives consistent action, though the internal contradiction between his role as mailman and peacemaker could be more embodied. The final choice to release the storm and deliver the message shows clear agency with visible cost (the storm's depletion). Some abstract phrasing ("respectfully rebellious gait," "fragile peace") lacks the concrete embodiment needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the storm's release creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—rival drones cross paths in acknowledgment. Clear who/where/when established early (Milo, cobalt arcade, twilight). The cost appears in the storm's depletion and the "dust of old grudges" washing away, though the conceptual price of peace could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade's neon atmosphere constrains action—the storm disrupts drone sensors, enabling the message delivery. Sensory detail is selective (clinking token, buzzing whine, electric sigh) and the setting evolution from empty arcade to activated lights reflects the peace process. The storm bottle functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging rival factions—escalates through the drone encounter where Milo must risk using the storm. The pressure tightens when the drone's sensors threaten detection, forcing Milo's decisive action. Cost is visible in the storm's discharge and the "weight" easing into "quiet purpose," though the rival factions' actual conflict remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "linking absences" and healing broken promises through acknowledgment of voids. The storm-in-a-bottle serves as a concrete vehicle for abstract peace-making. The final image of crossing drone paths crystallizes the theme without stating it, though some phrasing ("We honor the voids") edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical compression ("cobalt arcade at twilight hummed") and Milo's perception filters details appropriately. Some register elevation doesn't quite match a mailman's likely lexicon ("respectfully rebellious gait," "fragile bridge"). The narrative distance stays controlled, though occasional abstractions ("invisible line that divided") could be more grounded in Milo's specific perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose shows purposeful rhythm variation and some strong images ("thunderstorm in a bottle," "metallic bird"). However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("fragile peace," "linking absences," "invisible line") and some sentences rely on telling over showing ("Milo's mission was not to deliver letters but to foster..."). Template structure appears in parallel constructions that could vary more.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of a mailman delivering peace through a bottled storm shows genuine originality. The specific synthesis of arcade setting, drone surveillance, and weather-as-weapon creates a fresh angle on peace-making narratives. The "linking absences" philosophy and the physical manifestation of broken promises healing through rain demonstrates risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
