<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor demonstrates clear motivation through spiritual curiosity and empathy with dying stars, with embodied actions like tracing stellar paths and the tremor response. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or struggle—the empathy flows too smoothly without cost or resistance, and the "vulnerability to quiet fire" transformation feels unearned without prior dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the janitor achieves "flourishing stillness" and understanding through stellar communion. The cost remains primarily conceptual—accepting vulnerability—but lacks visible price on the page. The orientation anchors (station, janitor, purpose) establish clearly, but the transformation from vulnerability to "quiet fire" needs stronger causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The station setting with weathered stone, copper tubes, and stone balcony creates atmospheric specificity that supports the contemplative tone. The yellow lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining how the janitor interacts with stellar memories. The "molten sunrise" spilling across cracked floors effectively charges the final image, though the setting could more actively pressure choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding strength through vulnerability while empathizing with falling stars—establishes early but lacks meaningful escalation. The tremor response and chord resonance deepen texture but don't narrow options or force trade-offs. No visible cost appears beyond accepting vulnerability, which reads more as enlightenment than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of "flourishing stillness" emerges through concrete actions—tracing stars, holding memories, the tremor-response—rather than assertion. The final image of cracks reflecting brave stars effectively reweights earlier material. However, the resolution toward "quiet fire" and gratitude feels slightly neat, lacking the complexity that would elevate thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("swept stardust from the void with reverence") and effective POV modesty. The perceptual signature—sensing stellar heartbeats, feeling cosmic rhythms—stays character-specific. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "fertile ground" and "universal silence" that edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, with evocative phrases like "luminous arcs across the firmament." However, abstract formulations ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," "fertile ground") accumulate without sufficient grounding, and some redundancy appears between "hush of an overlooked era" used twice and overlapping descriptions of the janitor's purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor as stellar empath offers a fresh angle on the custodian archetype, with specific details like the yellow lantern conduit and tremor-response creating originality. The synthesis of vulnerability and strength through stellar communion feels earned through accumulation, though the resolution trends toward the safely spiritual without bold risk-taking.</comment>
