<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "perceptively calm" trait reads as label-only without visible cost or trade-off. No secondary character applies pressure, limiting relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through collective healing, but the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern accumulation toward communal restoration. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and clearly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory ruins create vivid contrast and atmosphere. Sensory details (purple perfume, amber glow) are selective and purposeful. The setting constrains choices through the specific location where memories converge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of collective healing is signaled early but lacks concrete opposition or tightening pressure. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs—the photographs simply accumulate without forcing trade-offs. The resolution arrives without earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the arc metaphor and collective memory reconstruction. The feather symbol and "transmute pain into a masterpiece" line approach explicit moralizing (-0.4). However, the final image of the field as "timeless canvas" offers resonant closure without stating the moral directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical, contemplative tone matching Mara's archival nature. POV remains stable throughout. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("luminous constellation," "tangled web of silhouettes") that feels performed rather than organic to the character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Significant overwriting issues: "swirled like whispered secrets," "pulse with the collective heartbeat," "tears fell like dew" (-0.8 for density). Template cadence appears in "She whispered...She knew...She cataloged" structure (-0.5). Multiple paraphrase loops, particularly around collective healing concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of reconstructing memory through photograph arcs offers moderate freshness. However, execution relies on familiar tropes (mysterious archivist, healing through art, community redemption) without sufficient transformation. The lavender/ruins juxtaposition reads as convenient symbolism.</comment>
