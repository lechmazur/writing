I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through prismatic imagery, magnetic resonance, and spatial transformation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the immortal learns what lies "after goodbye."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The immortal's centuries of ennui drives authentic action when the cursed fragment appears, and his final transformation from boredom to purpose lands with earned cost. Internal progression from "eyes heavy with centuries" to "heart beating in sync with the magnetic chorus" tracks cleanly. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of the twin-self encounter, which could use more embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the immortal discovers goodbye is "not a final cut but a transition, a magnetic pivot in spacetime," with the cost of abandoning his crystalline sanctuary. The accumulative build through magnetic fields, spatial mutiny, and prismatic echoes coheres at the ending. Slight opacity in the middle corridor sequence prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline cavern and its prismatic walls actively shape the immortal's choices, particularly when "walls rippling, colors shifting from sapphire to amber." Magnetic fields and spatial distortions constrain movement and enable transformation. The "prismatic escondite" returns meaningfully in the final image as witness to change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through magnetic pull → spatial mutiny → corridor lattice → twin encounter → dissolution of the amulet → final departure. The immortal's agency drives each transition, though the middle corridor sequence ("Will you stay?") lacks immediate pressure compared to the opening and closing beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of an immortal confronting finality, with goodbye reframed as transformation rather than ending. The twin's wisdom that worlds "fold into another plane" resonates without moralizing. The final image of stepping toward "a horizon stitched together by magnetic intrigue" perfectly encapsulates earned understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to immortal perspective, with strong moments like "a lover's sigh" and "hushed thunder." Some passages drift toward abstract philosophical language ("spatial mutiny brewing beneath the static") that slightly dulls immediacy. The brief dialogue from the twin and corridor voice integrates naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("Each particle a tiny echo of a goodbye") but suffers from abstract density in places. Phrases like "dimensionally aware" and "Euclidean logic" feel more conceptual than embodied. Some repetition of "magnetic" (11 instances) and "prismatic" (5) creates mild echo without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an immortal learning about endings through magnetic-spatial transformation offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of boredom, magnetic fields, and spatial geometry creates an original framework. The revelation that goodbye enables dimensional folding rather than cessation transforms the familiar immortality trope.</comment>
