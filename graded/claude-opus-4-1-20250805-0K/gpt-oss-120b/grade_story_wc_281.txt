<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism and affection for truth provide consistent motivation, but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract concepts ("telepathy pill recall," "somatic markers") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to share findings shows agency, though the emotional cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Mara discovering she can create "feedback loops" between light, the geode, and neural patterns, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where skepticism transforms into "willowglass hope." However, the cost remains abstract—we see no concrete sacrifice or foreclosed path, only philosophical reframing without dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The light painting studio with its "programmable LEDs" and "phosphor particles" provides specific texture, and the muscovite geode's "opalescent veins" create vivid imagery. The setting enables Mara's experiments but doesn't constrain choices or create pressure beyond providing tools.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara can prove "neural resonance" without drugs—progresses through a single experimental sequence without meaningful opposition or tightening. The "faint whisper of another mind" arrives without struggle or cost, and no option is foreclosed when she succeeds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of skepticism yielding to wonder emerges through the "willowglass" metaphor (transparent yet resilient), but relies on explicit statements like "even the most skeptical heart could learn to trust." The final image of shared secrets through "curiosity meets compassion" tells rather than dramatizes the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent scientific-poetic register appropriate to Mara's character, with phrases like "fractally precise patterns" and controlled technical vocabulary. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond this scientific lens, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears throughout without clear pattern-teaching ("willowglass light," "telepathy pill recall," "somatic markers as conduit"), creating conceptual opacity. Template cadence runs appear ("She programmed...She recorded...She knew...") and the prose relies on abstract exposition over concrete action, particularly in describing the experimental process.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fusion of light art with neuroscience concepts offers a fresh angle, and "willowglass hope" as a metaphor for resilient skepticism shows originality. However, the execution remains abstract, with the telepathy concept feeling more like borrowed jargon than transformed material.</comment>
