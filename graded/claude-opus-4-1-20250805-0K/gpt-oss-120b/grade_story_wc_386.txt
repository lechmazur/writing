I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, assessing its immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where dream fragments and imagery accumulate toward a resonant reconfiguration. The closure shows the whisperer's journey outward with "borrowed starlight solidified in her veins" - a Conceptual Repricing where salvaging purity requires collective reassembly rather than individual excavation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whisperer's motivation to "expose hidden purity" drives consistent action through dream analysis and shrine ritual. Internal conflict between careful truth-weaving and urgency creates authentic tension. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("singular purpose") rather than embodied contradiction, and the character remains more archetype than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing - the realization that purity must be reassembled from collective fragments rather than salvaged whole. The accumulative lens holds as dream fragments build toward this reconfiguration. Cost appears in "borrowed starlight solidified in her veins" suggesting transformation's price, though the emotional weight could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting actively constrains and enables - its "window of connection" bridges realms, the melted globe serves as portal, ice walls become "choir of quiet light." Sensory details like "pine and salt" fragrance ground the mystical. The frozen/melted dichotomy reinforces thematic tension throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual quest to collective healing as the whisperer realizes she must guide dream fragments back through others. The shift from analyzing to embedding cameos shows agency. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost - we see method but not price of this spiritual labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of fragmented wholeness - the melted globe's shards living in collective dreams. The ending reweights "salvage" from extraction to collaborative reassembly. Yet the piece occasionally states its wisdom directly ("truth, carefully woven, could expose hidden beauty") rather than letting images carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains mystical register consistently with phrases like "borrowed starlight" and "dream-tide." However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("singular purpose," "inextricable communion") that doesn't match the tactile work of wreck-diving. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice stays coherent but lacks distinctive personality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("candles flickered, each flame catching a sliver of borrowed starlight"). However, abstract scaffolding pervades ("The method was simple yet profound," "She realized that"). Template cadence appears in dream cataloging. The final paragraph's declarative assertions ("she knew the pure thing she salvaged would illuminate") replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of wreck-diving with dream-whispering creates fresh territory. The melted snow globe as liquid mirror/portal offers original imagery. The piece commits to its mystical premise without hedging. However, the resolution's abstraction ("countless other shattered dreams") retreats toward generic universality rather than staying with specifics.</comment>
