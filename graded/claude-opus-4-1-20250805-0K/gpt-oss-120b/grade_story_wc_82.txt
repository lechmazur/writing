<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker's grief motivation is clear and drives his actions, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation of grief into light carries emotional weight, yet the character reads more as a vessel for poetic imagery than a fully realized individual with blind spots and specific flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward the ending, but closure lacks decisive change or clear cost—the lantern maker simply continues his cycle. The final image of "ascending while descending" provides resonance but no legible before/after shift or foreclosed path, failing the closure requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden and glass basilica create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that shapes the ritual's sacred quality. Sensory details like "fragrant jasmine mingled with steam" and "roasted jasmine and sandalwood" effectively layer the setting, though the environment doesn't directly constrain choices at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>While the piece establishes the stake of transforming grief, no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs—the lantern maker performs his ritual without obstacles or increasing pressure. The "luminous torment" remains static throughout rather than deepening through choice or reversal, and no options narrow or costs compound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief through craft emerges organically through the glass basilica as dream recorder and origami cranes as vessels for pain. The paradox of "ascending while descending" offers conceptual richness, though the ending doesn't fully reweight prior material with a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on light and transformation. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("filaments as if coaxing fireflies into cages of crystal") that prioritizes beauty over clarity, and no dialogue tests naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While individual sentences achieve poetic resonance, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops ("luminous torment" appears four times) and abstract phrasing that reduces momentum. Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence without clear payoff creates overwriting, and several paragraphs could be removed without changing knowledge or situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-craft with the floating island dream recorder offers fresh conceptual territory beyond typical grief narratives. The specific ritual of polishing dreams with gems and folding them into origami cranes creates memorable particularity, though execution relies heavily on abstraction rather than grounded detail.</comment>
