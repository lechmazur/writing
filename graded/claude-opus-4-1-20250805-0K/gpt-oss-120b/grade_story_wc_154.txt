<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The translator's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives consistent action, and her "shrewdly innocent" paradox manifests in how she reads trauma while refusing cynicism. However, the child remains passive after awakening, and the translator's internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—her compassion flows without meaningful resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through coral metaphor and translation acts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared anxieties transform into "quiet strength." However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt—the "lotus-hearted ache" is asserted but not dramatized through specific loss or foreclosed options. The orientation anchors (translator, atrium, twilight) arrive clearly by ~40 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mist-wrapped atrium creates atmospheric pressure, and the brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when the translator uses its "essence" to seal meaning. Sensory detail filters through the translator's professional lens ("gentle click of her pen," "faint perfume" of anxieties), though the setting could more actively shape her tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming trauma into healing—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening or reversal. The child's awakening provides minimal complication, and the translator faces no resistance to her healing work. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds modestly through layered metaphors, but no option is foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coral-as-resilience metaphor and the concept of grafting meaning onto wounds emerge through particulars rather than assertion. The final image of "shared anxieties into quiet strength" offers a non-literal answer to trauma's persistence. However, the theme tends toward the therapeutic without sufficient complexity or counter-reading—healing proceeds too smoothly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("soft, violet hue," "lotus-hearted ache"), though it occasionally drifts into elevated diction that strains the translator's practical role. The child's voice appears only in the decoded message, creating missed opportunity for dialogue contrast. Psychic distance remains stable but somewhat removed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("mist clung," "twilight draped," "violet hue" in the opening alone) and abstract constructions like "shared anxieties" repeated without variation. The prose achieves moments of clarity ("I am scared of night because the sky is a cracked mirror of bombs") but suffers from density without propulsion—many sentences describe states rather than advance action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The coral-as-healing-network offers a fresh angle on trauma translation, and the child's cast as text-bearing object shows ingenuity. The piece commits to its lyric-accumulative mode, though it retreats into therapeutic abstraction rather than following harder implications of grafting new meaning onto wounds—what is lost in translation?</comment>
