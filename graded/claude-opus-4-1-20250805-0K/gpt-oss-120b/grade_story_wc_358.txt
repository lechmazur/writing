<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to document wind patterns is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains largely analytical without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to signal the control tower lacks visible personal cost—she achieves her goal without sacrifice or meaningful change. Character reads more as competent professional executing a task than someone wrestling with competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around wind documentation, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration with cost. The vortex "releasing pent-up pressure in a gentle sigh" and town's pulse returning presents resolution without visible price—Mara simply succeeds. No path is foreclosed, no opportunity lost, no stance crystallized under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth creates genuine spatial constraint that shapes Mara's navigation and wind-tracking methodology. Sensory detail effectively renders the "canyon-like streets" and "whispering tunnels" through selective focus on sound and movement. The environment directly enables the story's central action of mapping convergence points between steel walls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—dissipating lingering storm energy—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or complication. Mara's survey proceeds without setback, her hypothesis proves correct, and the resolution arrives through whispered command without trade-off. The "singular convergence" folding onto itself lacks earned causality from protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of "foresight in action" explicitly stated in italics and repeated verbatim reads as thesis announcement rather than emergent meaning. The flight engineer's patch functions as convenient symbol without constraining choice. Final image of containers "stretching like hopeful fingers" attempts resonance but lacks the particularity to reweight prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to Mara's investigator role, with controlled syntax like "each breath a measured note" and "hazy precision." However, perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—any competent investigator might notice these same details. Dialogue absence prevents full assessment of voice range under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("ghostly vortex," "hopeful fingers") without pattern-teaching. Template phrasing emerges in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, though information density remains adequate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The accident investigator documenting wind patterns in shipping containers offers competent execution of prompt elements without transformation. The premise follows predictable investigative beats without surprise or fresh angle. Mara's methodical success lacks the specificity or unexpected turn that would distinguish this from other post-disaster survey narratives.</comment>
