<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aric's motivation is clear and consistent—his obsession with capturing missed chances through perpetual motion drives every choice. The character shows genuine internal contradiction between hope and grimness, and his final acceptance of the chipped die's "permanent flaw" as stabilizing rather than destructive demonstrates earned growth. However, some interiority relies on abstract philosophical statements ("boundless confinement was the catalyst for creation") rather than embodied perception, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aric transforms the staircase from prison to laboratory, with the chipped die finally landing scarred-side-up as proof that imperfection enables perpetual motion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mathematical attempts build toward this conceptual repricing. Cost is visible in "years sketching equations" and the acceptance of permanent flaw, though the transformation feels slightly too neat in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as both setting and constraint, with its "endless loops" and shifting steps directly enabling Aric's perpetual motion machine. Specific details like "bronze frame," "rotating disc of polished glass," and "marble arches" create tactile presence. The staircase's transformation from prison to laboratory constrains and enables the central choice, though some descriptions lean abstract ("metaphor for boundless confinement").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving perpetual motion through accepting imperfection—escalates from dice rolls through equation-sketching to building the bronze contraption, with the staircase's responsive "quivering" marking genuine escalation. The chipped die's "stubborn refusal" creates sustained tension that pays off when it finally lands scarred-side-up. However, the resolution arrives somewhat mechanically without sufficient resistance in the final movement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of imperfection enabling rather than hindering perpetual motion emerges organically through the chipped die's behavior and Aric's mathematical proofs. The paradox that "deliberate imbalance...stabilized the motion" offers genuine complexity. However, phrases like "boundless confinement" and "cage and key" feel overly articulated, and the final paragraph tends toward explicit thematic summary rather than letting the image carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent philosophical-poetic register appropriate to Aric's mathematician-poet nature, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "each step a silent promise of ascent and return." No dialogue appears, avoiding potential inconsistency. The perceptual signature shows through mathematical framings ("geometry of probability," "living algorithm"), though some passages drift toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments ("dice...one scarred by a chip that caught the dim light like a wounded star") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "boundless confinement," "perpetual motion," and "missed chance/opportunity." The template structure "Thus he..." appears twice, and several sentences paraphrase the same concept of paradoxical balance. These loops diminish momentum despite generally clean grammar and varied sentence structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of mathematical proof driving physical perpetual motion through accepting imperfection offers a fresh synthesis of philosophical and mechanical elements. The specific detail of the chipped die as both flaw and catalyst transforms the familiar "perfectionism blocks progress" trope. However, the abstraction around "boundless confinement" and the somewhat predictable resolution prevent full originality.</comment>
