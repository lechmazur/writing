<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by skepticism toward corporate lies, but her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction or struggle during key moments. The revelation about the stillpoint being a mental state arrives without sufficient dramatic resistance or cost to her worldview.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain (investigation → reconstruction → discovery → understanding) but the closure lacks visible cost—Mira gains knowledge and power without sacrificing anything meaningful. The "stillpoint as mental state" revelation feels unearned without prior setup or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radioactive wasteland orchard creates atmospheric pressure with glowing fruit and dust storms, and sensory details like "phosphorescent sheen" effectively convey the hostile environment. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain Mira's choices or shape her tactics beyond providing a backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncovering truth about the diamond) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation—Mira encounters no real obstacles, reversals, or costs in her investigation. The dust storms intensify but don't create pressure that forces difficult choices or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges through concrete action (reconstructing shredded documents, debunking the curse) but resolves too neatly into a moral about stillness and clarity. The final transformation of the orchard from decay to sanctuary lacks earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Mira, with some effective perceptual details like "each fragment shouting a hidden clue." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctiveness and occasionally slips into exposition ("Mira understood that the cursed legend was a smokescreen") rather than dramatized realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains basic clarity but suffers from repetitive structures ("Mira felt...", "She had come to...", "She suspected...") and abstract phrasing that tells rather than shows ("the exhilaration of having turned myth into measurable reality"). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly in the closing paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard setting and conspiracy debunker protagonist offer some freshness, but the resolution follows predictable beats—skeptic proves supernatural element has rational explanation, then gains its power. The "stillpoint as mental state" twist arrives without sufficient groundwork.</comment>
