<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seeker's motivation to "understand the architecture of lies" drives consistent action through the sundial manipulation and lock-opening, though internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The final choice to "salvage truth" represents change but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with imagery building toward revelation, but closure lacks visible cost—the seeker gains understanding without sacrificing anything concrete. The lock-opening creates forward movement but the "architecture of lies" crumbling reads as abstract assertion rather than dramatized consequence with price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canal setting and sundial constrain the central action effectively when aligning with rusted gears. Sensory details like "water that reflected dying light like a mirror of memory" create atmosphere, though the Liar's Cathedral remains abstract backdrop rather than embodied space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lock mechanism provides one concrete obstacle resolved through sundial alignment, but escalation remains flat—no opposing force complicates the seeker's progress. The "architecture of lies unraveling" declares stakes without dramatizing resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sundial-as-truth-revealer motif recurs meaningfully, and "salvage" resonates across mechanical and metaphorical registers. However, the theme articulates too directly through phrases like "training instincts was his compass" rather than emerging from dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "bruised with violet" showing distinct texture, but relies heavily on abstract constructions ("serene upheaval of routine") over concrete perception. No dialogue to evaluate; internal thought tends toward declaration rather than embodied awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Extensive paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "architecture of lies unravel"/"architecture of lies crumble"/"salvage truth"/"salvage the stories" repeat without advancement. Template cadence ("He felt...He realized...He whispered...He raised") creates mechanical rhythm. Mixed metaphors (sundial as map/prayer/compass) muddle rather than layer meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sundial-as-truth-detector offers a fresh angle on the quest narrative, and "serene upheaval" captures paradox effectively. However, the execution relies on abstract declarations about lies and truth rather than specific, grounded transformation of familiar material.</comment>
