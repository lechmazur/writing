<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" is established but remains intellectually abstract rather than emotionally embodied. The choice to place the shard and observe its effects shows agency, yet internal conflict is told ("hoping the silence could be a tool rather than a trap") rather than felt through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization about sanctifying the town's rhythm provides closure but lacks the visceral cost that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the hush gradually spreading through objects and houses, creating a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands as the narrator understands their role in catalyzing subtle shifts, though the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The orientation anchors (pier at dawn, perfumer's shop) arrive clearly within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay setting with its cottages, pier, and perfumer's shop creates atmospheric coherence, and specific details like "amber halos stretching like lazy thoughts" ground the piece. The environment enables the discovery of the shard and provides displaced objects (coffee cup, sea-glass bottle) that become conduits for the hush. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices or create pressure that would push toward higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens as the hush spreads through the town. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as silence radiates outward, but lacks meaningful tightening or pressure that would force difficult choices. The resolution arrives through observation and gentle acceptance rather than through agency that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of noticing subtle transformations emerges through the spreading hush and the narrator's role as catalyst. The perfumer's shard as "inadvertently profound" silence that shapes unintended thoughts provides thematic texture. The ending offers a non-literal answer about houses feeling alive through shared listening, though the insight tends toward the abstract ("creeping normality that hides under every sunrise") rather than arising from concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "streetlights daydream" and "hushed blaze," creating a contemplative register appropriate to the narrator's observational stance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sanctify my own restless mind") that doesn't fully align with the more grounded sensory moments. The lack of dialogue means all characterization must come through narration, which sometimes tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops undermine momentum: "hushed blaze" appears three times, "creeping normality noticer" twice, and the concept of houses feeling alive is restated rather than developed. Template cadence appears in "I walked... I found... I discovered... I bought... I placed... I felt... I realized... I left..." creating mechanical progression. The prose achieves moments of lyrical beauty but suffers from repetitive stems and conceptual redundancy that dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "shard of hush" that spreads silence through displaced objects offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. The specific detail of the perfumer's orris root and its milky, speckled surface provides texture beyond generic magic objects. However, the execution remains somewhat abstract, and the transformation of ordinary observation into mystical communion follows familiar patterns without sufficient grounding in lived particulars.</comment>
