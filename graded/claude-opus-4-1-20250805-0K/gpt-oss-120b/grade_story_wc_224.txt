<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to understand "the shape of home" drives consistent choices through the stone's exploration, with embodied sensory details (mercury-glass eyes, vibration through marrow). The final renunciation (placing the stone back) carries visible cost as she accepts home as resonance rather than place. Internal contradiction between seeking shelter and embracing formlessness plays out through concrete actions, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("maps of feeling").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory memories (pine resin, rain, mother's lullaby) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where home transforms from fixed location to portable melody. The cost appears in "after remembering becomes painful" and the foreclosed possibility of physical shelter. Opening orientation is deliberately dreamlike but anchors the bookstore-mountain and Lira's quest early enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore hybrid creates genuine spatial constraint—"swallowed entire vistas" establishes scale while "winding corridors" and specific sensory markers (candlelight, pine resin, old ink) ground movement. The feather becomes a crucial tool that enables reading the stone through vibration. Setting actively shapes the quest as the mountain's "stone ribs" breathe with Lira's discovery, making environment inseparable from resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory accretion: stone's vibration → dream-scapes → feather reading → hidden corridor → mercury book → scent memories. The dominant stake (finding home's shape) tightens when painful memories shatter "like glass into shards of doubt," forcing confrontation. Cost registers in accepting home as ephemeral resonance rather than physical shelter, though the transformation could land with more visceral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the stone's "maps of feeling" reframe language as emotional geography, while the mountain's breathing architecture suggests home as living relationship rather than static place. The final image—home as "melody she could hear even in the silence of daylight"—offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through the feather's "texture light as a sigh" and the book's skin-like vellum pulsing with life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves mythic register ("mercury-glass seer," "labyrinthine bookstore") with sensory precision ("pine resin and old ink"). Perceptual signature shows in how Lira experiences through vibration and reflection rather than direct sight. Rhythm modulates effectively from flowing description to shorter pulses during discovery ("She pressed the feather deeper"), though occasional drift into elevated abstraction ("maps of feeling, each curve a compass") slightly weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"mercury-glass seer named Lira drifted between aisles" establishes character, movement, and ethereal quality simultaneously. Some figurative excess appears ("cathedral," "marrow of bones," "night flowers") but serves the mythic register. Minor loops include "shape of home" repetition and adjacent concepts ("forgotten memories"/"buried talents"), though the pattern-teaching around resonance/vibration motifs largely succeeds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bookstore-as-mountain and language-as-feeling-maps offers fresh angle on quest narrative. The feather reading method (translating vibrations rather than visual symbols) shows genuine invention. Risk-taking appears in the dreamlike logic and refusal to explain the stone's mechanics explicitly, trusting accumulative revelation. The resolution—home as portable resonance—transforms the familiar journey-home trope through specific sensory anchoring.</comment>
