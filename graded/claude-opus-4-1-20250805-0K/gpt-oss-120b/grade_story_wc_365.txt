I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory mapping, parallel universe layering, and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where frozen crew awaken.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to uncover the withheld truth drives consistent action, and her unique sensory mapping ability creates distinctive perception. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - she pursues her goal without meaningful hesitation or cost-weighing that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the crew awakens and the shard fragments into stars, with the cost being the shard's destruction. The accumulative lens holds as sensory patterns build toward this transformation, though the parallel universe mechanics feel somewhat convenient rather than earned through prior constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting constrains choices effectively - the green shard's location beneath the fuel line, the frozen crew's presence, and the hidden log behind the conduit all drive specific actions. Sensory details like "rusted hulls whispered under flickering fluorescents" create atmosphere while the spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovering truth to freeing the frozen crew, with the shard's destruction as visible cost. The "cyclically spontaneous pulse" creates ambient pressure, though the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that would force harder trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weight of withheld truth and its liberation, with the final image of scattered glass becoming stars offering resonance without stated moral. The commander's choice between elite evacuation and mass stasis creates genuine moral complexity that resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "cartographic ribbons that only I can read" establishing Lira's unique perceptual signature. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("lattice of possibilities," "tapestry of worlds") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff pattern. Phrases like "murmur of half-remembered dreams" and "pearls in a glass bottle" accumulate without advancing pressure, creating mild overwriting that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The sensory map maker concept offers fresh perspective on perception-as-cartography, and the parallel universe navigation through sensory currents provides original synthesis. The story commits to its premise though doesn't fully transform familiar multiverse tropes.</comment>
