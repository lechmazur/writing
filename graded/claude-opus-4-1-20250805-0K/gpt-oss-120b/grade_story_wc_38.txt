<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Selene's motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength drives consistent action through dance and cipher work, with embodied details like the copper braid singing and the crystal's pulse matching her heartbeat. The final choice to leave encoded journal pages for future seekers shows earned transformation with visible cost (the lab's collapse as "release"). However, some passages drift into abstract declaration ("turning weakness into a pattern of strength") rather than dramatized struggle, and the internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through dance, cipher work, and the recurring dice imagery, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lab rises "like a phoenix" and Selene's encoded vulnerability becomes shared strength. The closure lands with felt cost (the lab's collapse as liberation) and the who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2. However, the accumulation relies heavily on metaphorical layering rather than concrete pressure that narrows options, and some transitions between beats feel associative rather than causally linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory setting with "rusted steel met the sigh of ancient tides" creates atmospheric pressure, and specific details like kelp leather journals and luminous algae ink ground the fantastical elements. The environment actively constrains choice when "the tide rose, the lab's pressure sealed the door," forcing Selene's sung solution. The spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she moves from altar to compartment to exit, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("coral tiles") without affecting tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of encrypting vulnerability as strength signals early and tightens when the rising tide seals the door, forcing Selene to transform the lock "into a melody." The revelation of the memory crystal provides a deepening that reweights her mission from personal to communal. However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or cost—the dice yield immediately to her song, and the lab's final "collapse" reads as willing release rather than earned struggle against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming vulnerability into encoded strength emerges organically through Selene's dance-cipher method and crystallizes in the final image of "encoded whispers, turning fear into a shared cipher." The spider web metaphor for time/patience recurs meaningfully, and the concept of "calm defiance" gains resonance through quiet actions rather than declaration. The ending's vision of future seekers learning to "encode their own frailties" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in passages like "each pirouette encrypted a fragment of vulnerability," though this elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied action into abstract declaration. No dialogue appears, appropriately for the single-character scenario. The POV remains stable in close third, but the perceptual signature lacks the selective bias that would make Selene's way of noticing distinctly hers versus any dancer-coder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Several passages contain paraphrase loops ("turning weakness into a pattern of strength the world could not read" followed immediately by similar restatement) and abstract declarations that slow momentum. The phrase "calm defiance" appears four times without variation, creating repetitive phrasing. However, strong moments like "the ink a luminous algae that faded only when read" show precise, evocative detail, and the closing image of dice as "silent witnesses" lands effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of code-breaking through dance in an underwater laboratory offers a fresh angle, particularly the copper braid that "sang in rhythm whenever she touched a cipher." The hangman's dice as non-falling numerical artifacts and the kelp-leather journal with disappearing algae ink show imaginative specificity. However, the core transformation narrative (vulnerability into strength) follows familiar patterns without sufficient complication, and some elements feel assembled rather than organically necessary.</comment>
