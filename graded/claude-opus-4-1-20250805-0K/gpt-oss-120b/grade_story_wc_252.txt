<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between protecting the harbor and seeking freedom drives meaningful choices, particularly when she chooses to unlock the island's heart. The "combative tenderness" manifests in embodied ways throughout. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed in the final beats, and secondary spirits lack the concrete embodiment that would elevate this to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara releases the scrimshaw and gains the island's heart within herself, with visible cost (letting go of inheritance). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery and motifs build toward the whale's call. Orientation anchors (dock worker, harbor, day after violence) establish cleanly by ~50 words. The cost could be more visceral at the moment of release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and phosphorescent algae create vivid sensory grounding, while the scrimshaw's tactile details ("shavings of bone glinted like moon-struck daggers") constrain choices. The island's appearance directly shapes Mara's path forward. Some middle passages lean on visual description without engaging other senses during key pressure moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Mara's progression from hearing the whale's call to stepping onto the dock to singing the hymn that reveals the island. The dominant stake (freedom vs. protection) crystallizes when she must choose to release the scrimshaw. However, the "day after violence became impossible" premise creates stakes that feel abstract rather than immediately pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of freedom through embracing one's true nature emerges organically through Mara's journey from harboring combative tenderness to channeling it toward peace. The whale's call unlocking "guarded hearts" resonates beyond literal plot. The ending image of Mara with "arms spread wide" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("seafoam clung to stone," "muscles sang of patience") that maintains consistency. POV remains stable with Mara throughout. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("crucible where one must detach") that doesn't fully align with a dock worker's lexicon, though the mythic tone partially justifies this.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong moments of propulsion ("The sea responded, pulling back the veil") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("releasing the guarded hearts of all who had lived in fear" followed by similar spirit descriptions). Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She felt... She knew... She stepped..."). Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of dock worker meeting mythic calling through whale-song and scrimshaw offers fresh specificity. "Combative tenderness" as both internal state and world condition after violence becomes impossible creates an original frame. The transformation of inherited pirate artifact into key for collective liberation avoids stock fantasy tropes through grounded harbor details.</comment>
