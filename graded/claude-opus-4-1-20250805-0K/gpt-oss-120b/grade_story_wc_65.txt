<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer concept is intriguing but remains largely conceptual rather than embodied through concrete contradictions or micro-choices. The character's motivation to "seed innovation within a constraint" drives the plot adequately, but internal conflict and emotional embodiment are minimal—he proceeds methodically without visible struggle or cost until the abstract realization at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from commission through modeling to implementation, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartographer embraces ignorance as creative canvas. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual ("humbled by his own ignorance") rather than viscerally felt, and the transformation of the kingdom reads as summary rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake create a vivid, constraining environment that shapes the cartographer's work conditions and the kingdom's agricultural solutions. Sensory details like "wind whipping his cloak" and "emerald curtains of the aurora" are selective and purposeful, though the setting could more directly pressure specific choices beyond providing a dramatic workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—averting famine through predictive modeling—is clear, but escalation remains steady rather than tightening. The three-month delay and silverfish surge complicate without forcing trade-offs; the aurora discovery feels convenient rather than earned through struggle. No meaningful reversal or moment where the cartographer must sacrifice one option for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming ignorance into possibility emerges organically through the cartographer's practice and the kingdom's adaptation. The "groundedly imaginative" approach bridges empirical and mythic effectively, though the final realization about "embracing what one does not know" edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The omniscient voice maintains consistent distance and employs evocative diction ("ignorance cartographer," "lattice of arrows"), but lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to character. No dialogue to evaluate, and while the prose has texture, it doesn't modulate significantly with emotional intensity or pressure points.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting appears ("emerald curtains of the aurora," "silent sentinel") but doesn't obscure clarity. The phrase "groundedly imaginative" repeats three times without variation, and several sentences could be condensed without loss of meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer concept offers a fresh angle on prediction and planning, and the synthesis of mythic tools with scientific modeling feels original. The specific solution of aurora-powered heaters for frost-resistant barley shows creative problem-solving, though the execution could push further beyond familiar fantasy-science hybrid territory.</comment>
