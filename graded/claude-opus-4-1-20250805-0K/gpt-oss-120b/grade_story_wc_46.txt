I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - density increases through layered imagery (sea glass, pearl, light without fire) building toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms from sky-watcher to "keeper of luminous peace."

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear but lacks internal contradiction or complexity. The transformation from star watcher to light-keeper happens smoothly without visible struggle or cost. Character remains somewhat archetypal despite specific actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the protagonist becomes "keeper of luminous peace" - but the cost remains abstract. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (glass, pearl, light) yet lacks a decisive moment where something is genuinely lost or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as more than backdrop - its mist, walls, and water pool actively participate in the ritual. Strong sensory detail ("coolness a whisper," "zephyr bloom") creates atmosphere that supports the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract - "to share light without using fire" - without concrete opposition or cost. The piece maintains coherent pressure through accumulation but never tests the protagonist's commitment through meaningful resistance or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of creating light without burning. The final line "the softest glow...can illuminate the darkest paths without ever burning" resonates without moralizing, though the wisdom feels somewhat unearned by concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm, though diction occasionally elevates beyond necessity ("serpentine grotto in mist"). Some phrases feel overwrought ("miniature sun that could breathe without flame") but POV remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing - "reflectively vibrant" appears three times, "zephyr bloom" four times. Figurative density overwhelms in places ("pearl of stillness pulsed," "spiral of glass," "luminous chords") without clear payoff. Several abstract constructions weaken immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of sharing light without fire offers a fresh angle on guidance/wisdom themes. The synthesis of earthbound perspective with cosmic awareness shows originality, though execution relies on familiar meditation/spiritual transformation patterns.</comment>
