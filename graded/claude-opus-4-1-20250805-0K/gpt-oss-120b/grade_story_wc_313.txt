<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Caitlyn's motivation to expunge the myth is clear and consistent, but her internal state remains largely unexplored during the investigation itself. The final moment of "calm certainty" and her smile suggest earned resolution, yet the path to this emotional state lacks embodied contradiction or struggle—she moves through revelations with steady competence rather than visceral conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as Caitlyn uncovers truth through photographs, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's shared narrative is restored. The closure lands with the town "breathing anew" and the myth expunged, showing clear before/after change. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"the weight of truth lift"—without dramatized sacrifice or visible price paid by Caitlyn herself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ridgeway setting anchors the story effectively, with the reservoir carrying thematic weight as both scar and revelation. Sensory details like the "sapphire-hued" label and "lanterns" creating "a corridor of light and shadow" are selective and purposeful. Yet the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain Caitlyn's choices—she walks, observes, and reveals without environmental pressure shaping her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—expunging the sabotage myth—is established early but lacks escalating pressure. Caitlyn's investigation proceeds smoothly through three photographs without resistance or complication; each revelation builds understanding but doesn't narrow her options or force difficult choices. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory versus individual truth emerges organically through the investigation, with the sapphire label linking past and present. The final image of the reservoir as "an ancient eye, watching the town breathe anew" offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing. The story effectively explores how shared narratives can heal or harm communities.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, with prose that occasionally rises to lyric moments ("midnight ridgeway at twilight stretched like a silver ribbon"). However, several phrases feel artificially elevated ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush") without clear POV grounding. No dialogue appears, limiting voice distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwrought figurative language ("silver ribbon over the restless water," "edges a whisper of old pine") and abstract phrasing that dulls momentum. The opening's temporal impossibility ("midnight ridgeway at twilight") creates immediate confusion. Multiple synonym loops appear ("mirrored hush"/"mirrored glass," "quiet observation"/"quiet offering"/"quiet vigilance") and the elevated register often clashes with the investigative action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of uncovering truth through old photographs offers a workable premise, and the reservoir town's submersion provides atmospheric specificity. However, the execution relies on familiar mystery-revelation patterns without surprising turns. The "vigilant warden" investigating historical truth follows expected beats.</comment>
