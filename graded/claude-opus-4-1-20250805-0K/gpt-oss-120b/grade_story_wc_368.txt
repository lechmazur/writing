<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her watchful nature consistent, but the transformation lacks embodied emotional complexity—her discovery and acceptance feel too smooth without internal contradiction. The donor heart provides interesting constraint but doesn't generate sufficient struggle or cost in her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Lira's understanding that "stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution," with the loom becoming a beacon, but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward the final crystallization, though the revelation arrives without sufficient resistance or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and crystal garden create vivid, purposeful settings that enable key discoveries, with sensory details like "amber mist" and "ribbons of light" well-integrated into action. The moonlight loom particularly constrains and enables the final transformation, elevating beyond mere description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding story magnetism, but escalation remains gentle—Lira follows paths and makes discoveries without meaningful opposition or narrowing options. The final loom activation carries some weight but lacks the pressure of foreclosed alternatives or visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of beauty bearing warning ("iridescent caution") emerges organically through the morpho wing and Lira's dual role as observer and participant. The final image of the loom as beacon resonates without explicit moralizing, though the insight about story magnetism could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Lira observes beautifully but generically, without character-specific bias or selection. Phrases like "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" repeat mechanically rather than evolving with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("She believed...She sensed...She smiled...She stepped") and filter-verb stacks ("feeling the valley mist swirl," "feeling the cool edge") dull immediacy. Abstract phrases like "quietly explosive insight" and "stories forever magnetized" lack concrete grounding, creating conceptual loops rather than advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house and story magnetism concept offer fresh angles, and the donor heart as perception-enabler shows originality. However, execution relies on familiar mystical journey patterns without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
