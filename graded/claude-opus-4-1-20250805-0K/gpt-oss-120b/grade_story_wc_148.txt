<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The boy's motivation to find redemption and guide others is clear, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—his emotions are told through abstractions like "heart beat steady with purpose" rather than shown through competing impulses. The final transformation from "cry wolf boy" to "guiding light" happens too smoothly without dramatized struggle or visible cost in the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with copperlight imagery and the hush motif building toward discovery, but the closure lacks decisive cost—the boy finds the map, guides others, and achieves peace without sacrificing anything tangible. The revelation of bodies and transformation to "beacon of truth" occurs through declaration rather than dramatized change with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting creates atmospheric pressure through "stone walls breathing salty wind" and the reef's physical danger, with the lattice constraining/enabling the boy's movement. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the reef sequence—"beneath the water, silhouettes of bodies rose" lacks concrete anchoring of depth, distance, or the boy's actual position relative to them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on the boy's need for redemption from his "cry wolf" legacy, with the hush promising peace, but escalation remains static—he follows the map, finds bodies, and achieves resolution without encountering resistance or having to choose between competing goods. The discovery unfolds without opposition or meaningful tightening of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of redemption through truth-telling emerges through the lattice prayers and the transformation from false alarms to "guiding light," with the recurring copperlight/hush creating resonance. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the moral—"the boy's legend transformed into a guiding light"—rather than letting the image carry the weight, and "every warning is a thread, not a wall" reads as inserted wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with "copperlight repose" and "breathing salty wind," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to this boy—descriptions could belong to any literary narrator. The mother's voice hidden in the lattice and the boy's whispered tale show voice moments, but overall the narration feels more like elevated literary prose than a character-specific perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "copperlight repose" appears four times, "lattice from confessional" three times, "cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son" three times, "scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" twice verbatim. Mixed metaphors ("lighthouse prison...breathing," "lattice...sustaining impossibilities") and abstract phrases like "thread a labyrinth with your own story" create opacity rather than clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse prison on a reef with a boy seeking redemption offers an interesting gothic atmosphere, and the lattice as protective talisman adds texture. However, the transformation from outcast to guide follows predictable redemption arc patterns, and the discovery of bodies lacks surprising inflection or non-obvious moral complexity.</comment>
