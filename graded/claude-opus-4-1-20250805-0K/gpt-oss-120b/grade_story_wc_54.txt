<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to resurrect the terminal is clear and her engineering mindset drives choices, but internal conflict remains abstract ("stoic wonder"). The transformation from problem-solving to hope-engineering shows progression, yet lacks embodied emotional cost—her "engineered heart" reads as label rather than felt experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the terminal resurrects and becomes a beacon, but causality wobbles—the sextant's alignment with voltage flow lacks credible mechanics. The closure lands with conceptual cost (transforming fleeting joy into lasting framework) but the "how" of power restoration through angle calibration strains believability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The terminal's physical details (silent hull, broken conduits, massive artery) effectively constrain the engineer's choices and the spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The setting transforms from dead structure to humming beacon, though some descriptions lean generic ("vaulted ceiling," "steel ribs").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting hope through engineering—progresses from power restoration to communication beacon activation, showing escalation. However, no meaningful obstacles resist her efforts; the terminal simply responds to her redirected flows without complication or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of engineering hope from abandonment emerges through concrete action and the recurring "maze of intentions" motif effectively links builders' past promises to the intern's present work. The final spiral image resonates, though the explicit statement about "engineering and hope" edges toward moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent engineering-minded perspective with technical vocabulary fitting the POV, but prose rhythm remains monotonous—most sentences follow similar length and structure. Filter-heavy constructions ("She realized," "She recalled," "She felt") diminish immediacy throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive repetition weakens momentum: "maze of intentions" appears four times, "stoic wonder" three times, "redirected flows" variants throughout. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]" opens most sentences), and abstract phrasing like "functionally creative" and "ethical currents" obscures concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of reverse-engineering hope from abandoned infrastructure offers a workable premise, but execution relies on familiar beats (lone engineer fixes broken system). The sextant-as-navigation-tool metaphor extends predictably without surprising transformation.</comment>
