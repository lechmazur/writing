I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through sensory detail, repeated motifs, and cadence shifts toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like slipping the decoy vial and seizing the rope coil. The "curiously steadfast" quality manifests in her movements despite the "comforting unease," though internal contradiction could deepen beyond this oxymoronic pairing. Her choice to place the watch fob on the negotiating table carries some cost, but the emotional stakes of her father's legacy could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Lila maintains the truce until sunrise, accepting the cyclical nature of conflict. The watch fob's placement on the negotiating table and its final warmth against her chest creates a before/after with felt cost: "knowing that until sunrise she had kept the truce, and that tomorrow would bring new false starts." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and repeated motifs (watch fob, truce of hush, comforting unease) build toward this acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly rendered through "stalls made of driftwood and canvas," "aromatic vapor," and "wooden beams" that echo footsteps. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - salt, ferment, iron-tasting rumors. The lanterns constrain choice by enabling the market's operation, and darkness becomes a tactical tool when Lila hurls them "into the gloom."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake - protecting the market's lanterns to maintain the truce - is signaled early and tightens when Captain Marrow's scout appears. Lila's agency drives the escalation through concrete actions: planting the decoy, seizing the rope, hurling the lanterns into darkness. The cost is visible in the "seed of future conflict" and the temporary nature of victory, though the physical confrontation resolves somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "comforting unease" and cycles of "false starts" - peace as temporary reprieve rather than resolution. The watch fob's ticking becomes "a metronome for the night to count down," and Lila's wish to capture "the sound of trust breaking" resonates with her father's broken promises. The final image of walking toward new "false starts and fresh chances" offers a non-literal answer about accepting imperfect peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception like "iron-tasting rumors" and the maritime lexicon. However, some phrases feel overwrought: "a brittle note that once echoed in her father's lullabies" strains credibility. The prose modulates appropriately during action sequences, tightening syntax when Lila lunges and darts, though occasional purple patches ("choreographed through countless false starts") interrupt momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Several passages contain unnecessary abstraction and repetition: "Her motivation was to capture the sound of trust breaking" tells what could be shown; "the comforting unease" appears four times without evolution. Strong moments like "The barrel burst with aromatic vapor" demonstrate clarity, but phrases like "choreographed through countless false starts she had survived" and "the seed of future conflict" lean abstract. The template-like structure of some sentences ("She knew... She had rehearsed... She paused...") creates monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of "truce of hush" - a fragile peace in a criminal underworld - offers a fresh angle on honor among thieves. The specific detail of lanterns as both practical necessity and symbolic vulnerability elevates the premise. However, the confrontation with the scout follows expected beats, and Captain Marrow remains a stock antagonist name without distinctive presence.</comment>
