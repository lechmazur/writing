I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and dust patterns toward a resonant discovery rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's ghost-seeing ability and technical expertise create a unique perspective, and her methodical engagement with spectral traces shows consistent character logic. However, her emotional state remains somewhat abstract ("weightless burden," "quiet purpose") without sufficient embodied contradiction or cost during key discoveries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers the ledger and transforms her "weightless burden" into "quiet purpose," with the ghosts' acknowledgment serving as emotional cost. However, the accumulation feels mechanically staged rather than organically pressured, and the orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain clear throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting constrains Mara's investigation through its decay patterns and hidden architecture, particularly when the dust accumulation reveals the concealed alcove. Sensory details like "stale, scented air" carrying "sawdust and popcorn" effectively filter through Mara's professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what the ceiling hides—progresses through Mara's methodical investigation, but lacks meaningful tightening or resistance. The ghosts cooperate immediately, the hatch opens easily, and the ledger appears without obstacle, creating insufficient pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of acknowledgment emerges through concrete discovery of the performers' ledger and the ghosts' grateful response. However, the thematic resolution feels somewhat predetermined, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would elevate beyond serviceable metaphor about hidden histories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some distinctive touches ("rain-slick night," "bruised clouds"). However, register drift into overly literary phrasing ("weightless burden," "tremulous glow") clashes with Mara's technical profession, and syntactic patterns become repetitive in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("flapped like a tired animal," "spiraling dance") and template constructions ("Mara's skillfully observant eyes," "engaged the barrel with the elevator's control circuit"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity, creating momentum drag particularly in the investigation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The elevator technician who sees ghosts offers a fresh angle, and using dust patterns as spectral maps shows creativity. However, the execution relies on familiar haunted circus imagery and the revelation of a hidden ledger feels derivative of countless ghost stories about unfinished business.</comment>
