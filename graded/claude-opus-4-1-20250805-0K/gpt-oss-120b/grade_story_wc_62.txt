I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery (ribbons, butterflies, stones) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration where the greenhouse becomes a sanctuary mapping collective grief.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliam's motivation as a gravestone carver seeking to map collective grief is clear and consistent. His "fiercely meditative" nature manifests through concrete actions like observing butterfly patterns and arranging stones. The spectral Mara adds pressure but doesn't create internal contradiction—the piece lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres as ribbons unfurl, butterflies migrate, and stones spiral toward the final heart-shaped configuration. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the greenhouse transforms into a sanctuary where "stone, ribbon, poem, and spirit entwined." The cost appears in villagers' shared mourning and the water gliding over the "ribbon-etched heart," though the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes Eliam's nightly ritual—its "cracked panes" filtering light, its "highest arch" where butterflies converge. The ribbons become a physical river of color "pouring into the greenhouse floor." Setting constrains choices through the specific architecture where Mara died and remains bound, making the space inseparable from the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the three-month butterfly migration timeline and Mara's spectral guidance pushing Eliam toward understanding. The dominant stake—mapping collective grief to create meaningful monuments—deepens as ribbons unfurl and stones accumulate. However, there's no moment where Eliam must choose between competing goods or face a genuine reversal; the progression feels too smooth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physical mapping of grief via ribbons, butterflies, and stones rather than stated philosophy. The final image of water gliding over the ribbon-etched heart while "the stone sang with the soft hum of butterflies" offers a non-literal answer about how collective grief flows rather than scars. The family poetry tradition adds texture without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the premise ("humid sigh," "thoughtful gravestone carver," "fiercely meditative river"). However, it lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Eliam notices things poetically but not in ways specific to a stone carver's trained eye. Some phrases feel overwrought ("thundering calm" appears three times) without earning their weight through precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose tends toward purple with mixed metaphors ("his mind was a fiercely meditative river") and repetitive elevated diction. "Thundering calm" recurs without variation or payoff. Sentences often strain for poetry over clarity: "The town's mourning was not a single wound but a flock of butterflies that fluttered through the years." Information density is compromised by ornamental language that doesn't advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving with butterfly migration and ribbon-weaving creates an unusual lens for exploring grief. The spectral mentor trope is familiar, but using her to guide physical mapping of collective sorrow through family poetry traditions offers specificity. However, the resolution—a basin that collects rain—feels safer than the imaginative setup promises.</comment>
