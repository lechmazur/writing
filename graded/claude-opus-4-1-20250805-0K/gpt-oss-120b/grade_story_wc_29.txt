I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where individual resistance becomes collective harmony.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as guardian-interpreter is consistent but lacks embodied emotional complexity during peak moments. The "cautiously hopeful surge" and later smile read as emotional labels rather than lived contradiction. Her final teaching gesture provides some character arc, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than dramatized through competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through collective harmony emerging from individual resistance, with visible cost in the community's transformation. However, the escalation from signal detection to valley-wide chorus feels rushed and mechanically convenient. The closure lands with thematic weight but the causal mechanics of how subsonic frequencies achieve unity remain vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The radio station setting provides functional pressure through its role as broadcast hub, but spatial choreography remains abstract. Sensory detail focuses heavily on abstract concepts ("ethereal pulse," "subsonic pattern") without grounding in concrete physical sensation. The environment doesn't meaningfully constrain choices beyond providing broadcast equipment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on preventing chaos through signal interference, with one meaningful tightening when the tricksters attempt their false alarm. However, the resolution feels too neat—the subsonic pattern effortlessly transforms panic into unity without dramatized struggle. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt through specific losses or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of interference-as-bridge and individual frequencies harmonizing collectively. The final image of the valley as chorus effectively reweights earlier isolation. However, the piece occasionally veers toward explicit thematic statements ("power plays could be outmaneuvered when every listener tuned their own inner frequency").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature, reading as competent but generic literary prose. Phrases like "ethereal grit," "celestial signal interpreter," and "cautiously hopeful" feel assembled rather than organic. No dialogue appears to test character distinction, and the narrative distance remains uniformly distant without purposeful modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive abstract language ("ethereal pulse," "subsonic signatures," "cosmic pranksters") creates opacity without earning metaphorical coherence. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The prose relies heavily on conceptual abstractions rather than concrete imagery, creating momentum drag particularly in the extended denouement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of using subsonic frequencies to counter cosmic interference shows creativity, but execution remains safely abstract. The transformation feels mechanical—students experimenting with kitchen appliances as resistance tools hints at originality but isn't developed with specific lived detail. The piece doesn't risk enough specificity to achieve memorable distinction.</comment>
