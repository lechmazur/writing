<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The exorcist's motivation to apologize to Mara is clear and drives the ritual, with embodied details like the perfume bottle's vibration against her wrist. However, the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves through the ritual without genuine struggle or cost until the abstract ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through perfume, music, and memory toward the apology's manifestation. The closure (sending the apology on induced currents as trees fall) occurs on page but lacks visible cost—we don't see what the exorcist sacrifices or how Mara receives it, making the "imperfect miracle" abstract rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail filters through the exorcist's perspective—amber glass, burned candles, blue glow crawling along wood. The archive and orchard constrain the ritual's geography and the perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that enables the magical connection, though the cottage remains distant and abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (delivering the apology before trees fall) has urgency but minimal escalation—the ritual proceeds smoothly with the sheet music conveniently providing the exact apology needed. No meaningful obstacles or trade-offs emerge; the "induced currents" simply work without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The broken mirror metaphor and the concept of "imperfect miracles" resonate through concrete images like the perfume bottle and torn sheet music. However, the theme leans heavily on abstract statements ("gossip turned into salvation," "gritty miracles can be sweet") rather than emerging from dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and metaphorical density ("gossip-column exorcist," "notebook clutched like a holy relic"). The prose maintains consistency but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("ethereal grit," "gritty ethereal chorus") without clear pattern-teaching for these oxymorons.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("thin breath of autumn," "whispered rumors turned into verses") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract loops. Multiple sentences restate the same concept of imperfect miracles and redemption without advancement, and filter-heavy passages ("she felt," "she sensed," "she remembered") dull immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gossip-column exorcist concept offers a fresh angle, combining supernatural and journalistic elements. The induced currents through perfume and music create original magic system mechanics, though execution relies on convenient discoveries (the perfect apology sheet appearing) rather than earned transformation.</comment>
