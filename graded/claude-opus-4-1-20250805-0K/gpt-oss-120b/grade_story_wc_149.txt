<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is clear and consistent (debt repayment across lifetimes), but lacks embodied internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her transformation from presence to absence reads more as completion than earned change through struggle. The "lovingly venomous" characterization gets stated but not dramatized through competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the bride's dissolution and the orchard's permanent transformation, with visible cost (her erasure). The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks. However, the transformation lacks intermediate causality—the mechanics of how her breath fertilizes soil or why this specific moment completes the debt remain opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse creates vivid atmosphere through "frost-bitten vines," "metallic hymn," and transmutation from "metal to memory." Setting actively shapes the narrative through the greenhouse's transformation. Minor deduction for some purple prose ("whisper of ash that clung to her shoulders as if grieving the sun itself").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (debt repayment) is clear but escalation reads as repetitive accumulation rather than meaningful tightening. Each ghostly visit follows the same pattern without raising cost or narrowing options. The final transformation arrives through declaration ("In an act that was both tender and fatal") rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical debt and redemption emerges through the orchard's transformation and recurring awakening motif. The carved stone bead effectively accumulates meaning as it brightens with each leaf unfurled. However, the "lovingly venomous" paradox gets explained rather than dramatized, and the ending's explicit message about debts being "repaid through resonance" edges toward moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose maintains consistent lyrical register appropriate to ghost story atmosphere. However, voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—the ghost bride's consciousness feels generic rather than particular. No dialogue to evaluate. Some register drift into elevated diction ("mournful elation," "ephemeral cameo appearances") without clear POV grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density creates overwriting issues—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated imagery without pattern-teaching payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops ("resonant awakenings"/"resonant awakening" repeated; "mournful elation" used twice identically). Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity and momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ghost bride as botanical alchemist offers a fresh angle, and the debt-across-lifetimes frame provides originality. The transformation of "alchemy from metal to memory" shows conceptual ingenuity. However, execution relies on familiar gothic ghost-story templates without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
