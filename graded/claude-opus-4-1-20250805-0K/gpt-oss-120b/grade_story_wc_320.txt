Looking at this story through the lens of immediate publishability in elite venues, I'll evaluate under an **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and resonant callbacks rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Selin's motivation to interpret signals and find beginnings in endings is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The character operates as a competent technician without visible cost or genuine flaw until the resolution, where the transformation feels unearned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the chord broadcasting and village awakening, with some conceptual cost in transforming decay to rebirth. However, the accumulative pattern lacks sufficient density increase, and the cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted tower city suspended over the gorge creates vivid atmosphere with strong sensory detail ("cables humming with forgotten frequencies"). The setting actively constrains choices through the tower's dormant circuitry and quantum coil, directly enabling the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of reviving the dead city coheres but lacks meaningful tightening or deepening under the accumulative lens. The resolution arrives through technical manipulation without genuine opposition or escalating pressure that would force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges through concrete action and the recurring "serenely electric" motif. The final broadcast creating village rebirth offers a non-literal answer, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("city of rusted towers hung like a broken harp"). However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("quantum coil," "syntactic") that doesn't fully match the mystical tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum ("serenely electric" appears 5 times, "beginning in every ending" conceptually repeated). Template cadence runs through "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract phrasing like "practical magic" and "disciplined mind could coax wonder" creates register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of decaying infrastructure with celestial signal interpretation offers moderate freshness. The concept of fragments containing living keys rather than relics provides some transformation of expected tropes, though execution remains somewhat safe.</comment>
