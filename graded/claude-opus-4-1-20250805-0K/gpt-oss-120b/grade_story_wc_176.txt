<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the rope and cylinder, though her internal contradiction between doubt and purpose could be more actively dramatized in scene. The "forgiving yourself" moment feels slightly unearned without showing the specific struggle that led to this release. Her final role as guardian who returns each solstice shows meaningful change with visible commitment cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through the rope's reconfiguration releasing names, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sanctum transforms into a "living library." Cost is visible in Mara's commitment to return each solstice and the traveler's discovery of Eira establishing ongoing stakes. The closure lands cleanly though the middle section could tighten the causal link between rope manipulation and name recovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora creates immediate atmosphere with "frosted floor" and walls that "melt frost in delicate veins." The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that directly constrains Mara's choices—she must reconfigure its braids to release the names. The environment actively responds to her work as "ice walls soften under the aurora's green tide," making setting essential to the closure's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—escalates from personal mission to communal legacy when the traveler adds Eira's name, showing how each addition "added another thread to the rope's luminous tapestry." The tightening occurs through Mara's physical struggle with the rope yielding names, though the middle lacks a clear moment of heightened resistance or cost before success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of names being "transcribed" from silence into light, avoiding abstract statements about memory. The final image of the sanctum as "living library" offers a non-literal answer about how memory persists through active preservation. The rope's transformation from holding "memory of every prayer" to becoming "a map of luminous pathways" deepens the theme through specific objects rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a lyrical register appropriate to the mythic tone with phrases like "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle," though some passages drift into elevated diction ("a testament that memory, once transcribed, could never truly freeze") that slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon. POV remains stable in third-person limited. The perceptual signature of noticing temperature and texture ("frosted floor," "chill of the sanctum seep into metal") is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around "forgotten names" (appears 7 times) and "snowmelt ardor" (twice), creating mild synonym churn. Some sentences carry ornate figurative language that slows momentum: "curtains dancing faster, painting the ceiling with colors that melted the last remnants of winter's grip." The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformation, though middle sections could achieve higher density by cutting scaffold phrases like "simple yet profound."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of preserving sound through rope reconfiguration offers a fresh angle on memory preservation, moving beyond typical archive or recording tropes. The specific synthesis of lost wax casting expertise with ancient rope manipulation creates an unexpected skill combination. However, the resolution into "living library" metaphor trends toward familiar territory, preventing higher originality scores.</comment>
