I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern recognition (tea leaves, geometry, shadows) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the library's "reversible exile" ends through accumulated ritual actions.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to "mentor resilience quietly" manifests through concrete actions (annotating, analyzing tea leaves, walking backwards when nervous), and her "combative tenderness" creates genuine internal contradiction. However, the character remains somewhat archetypal - a mystical librarian-healer - without deeper personal stakes that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "the library breathed a sigh of relief, its heart beating anew" after the shadow dissolves and walls heal themselves. The accumulative lens holds as tea-leaf patterns, annotations, and shadow-work cohere toward restoration. Deduction for slightly mechanical resolution where every element resolves too neatly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library setting actively constrains choices through "dust like ancient whispers," cracked teacups, and hidden chambers revealed by tea-leaf geometry. Sensory details like "chains singing a soft metallic hymn" and "air smelled of pine and old paper" create atmosphere while the shadow-in-glass functions as micro-setting that enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on ending the library's "reversible exile" with escalation through tea-leaf decoding revealing "a precise moment when the sun would strike," then the shadow fracturing into "thousand luminous shards," culminating in the altar scene. The pressure accumulates but lacks genuine risk - success feels predetermined rather than earned against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-gentleness emerges organically through "combative tenderness" and "battling neglect required the gentlest of touches." The final image of walls healing themselves while the library's "heart beating anew" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction like "resilience, once mentored quietly, would now roar back."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm in phrases like "dust lay like ancient whispers" but occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("silvered panes," "reversible pilgrimage"). The POV remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond poetic observation - the archivist's specific way of noticing doesn't feel unique to her profession or personality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("afternoon shadow caught in glass, a thin rectangle of darkness") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence appears in "She whispered... She felt... She placed..." sequences. Information density varies wildly between ornate description and plot advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tea-leaf geometry method for unlocking temporal sequences offers fresh specificity, as does the shadow-in-glass concept. However, the mystical-librarian-heals-ancient-repository frame follows familiar fantasy patterns without sufficient transformation. The piece commits to its lyrical mode but doesn't risk enough to distinguish itself from similar magical-realism library stories.</comment>
