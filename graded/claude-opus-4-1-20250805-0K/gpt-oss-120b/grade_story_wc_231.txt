I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern recognition, sensory accumulation, and cadence shifts rather than causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlowe's character shows consistent motivation through his investigation of the stranger's message, with embodied loneliness and the choice to preserve memory. However, the emotional progression relies on abstract states ("heart lighter") rather than embodied contradiction, and the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through accumulated pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Marlowe's acceptance of being "truly seen," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative pattern of gaps-as-memory works conceptually but lacks the density increase or cadence shift that would make the final "promise that no one...will ever be lost to oblivion" land with earned weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The opal dock and nautical twilight create strong atmospheric pressure, with sensory details like "bruised lavender" sea and the dock's reflective surface constraining Marlowe's investigation method. The setting actively shapes his ability to read the tide's pauses, making environment essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's message—remains static rather than escalating through accumulated pressure. While Marlowe's investigation progresses from observation to understanding, no meaningful tightening occurs; the "gaps" discovery doesn't force a choice or create visible cost beyond abstract comfort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory and isolation emerges through the dried flower's persistence and tide patterns, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the lighthouse beam as promise resonates thematically, though the "borrowed memory" concept relies on assertion ("he realized the gaps...were the stranger's borrowed memories") rather than earned revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance, though Marlowe's perceptual signature lacks distinction beyond poetic observation. Phrases like "softly persistent rhythm" and repeated "softly persistent" create intentional pattern but risk becoming mechanical rather than voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Significant overwriting mars the prose: "bruised lavender," "brittle petals a soft reminder," "hollow sigh of water" stack figurative language without clear purpose. Template repetition of "softly persistent" (3x) and paraphrase loops ("a silent request to remember, to keep the stranger's story alive") dull momentum. The abstract register ("nameless stranger," "fleeting hope") disconnects from concrete immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of reading memory through tide patterns offers originality, and the lighthouse keeper's eccentric method feels specific. However, the emotional arc—lonely keeper finds meaning through preserving another's memory—follows familiar templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
