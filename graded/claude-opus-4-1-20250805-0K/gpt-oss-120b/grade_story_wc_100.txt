I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation as an undertaker seeking to guide souls is consistent and embodied through concrete actions with the lens. His "inadvertently stubborn" trait manifests in occupying impossible flooded spaces. However, interiority lacks contradiction—he moves with singular purpose without internal conflict, and the final merger with light feels unearned without prior cost to his choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands—the library transforms from tomb to sanctuary through accumulated light imagery. Cost appears in "the weight of centuries pressing against his chest" and Marlow's final dissolution. However, the transformation lacks a clear before/after state since we never see the library's initial condition, and Marlow's vanishing feels symbolic rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater library setting constrains movement and shapes every action—water pressure, flooded alcoves, and phosphorescent ink create a vivid, specific world. The broken lens interacting with bioluminescent fish adds texture. Setting directly enables the story's resolution as the water becomes the medium for light transmission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest to haunted souls—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Marlow simply assembles the lens and succeeds; no tightening occurs. The "weight lifting from his shoulders" suggests relief but without prior struggle shown on-page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density, but the beats remain static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor, connecting Marlow's undertaker role to guiding the dead. The library as knowledge-tomb resonates. However, the resolution's ease—spirits simply respond to light—lacks complexity. The final line about being "never truly forgotten" reads as assertion rather than earned wisdom from struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm: "The sea had long swallowed the stone streets." POV remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the very concept of rest") and some constructions feel overwrought ("chased stillness" appears without clear meaning). The prose serves atmosphere over clarity at times.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("water pressed against its glass walls like a patient sigh") but suffers from repetition—"permanent address" appears four times, "chased stillness" three times without variation. Abstract phrases like "occupying impossible spaces" and "the very concept of rest" lack concrete grounding. The final paragraph loops similar ideas about memory and forgetting without advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater library housing restless souls offers a fresh setting, and the undertaker-as-lighthouse-keeper synthesis feels original. The image of reassembling broken glass to create "a giant, trembling eye" is striking. However, the resolution follows expected patterns—light guides souls to rest—without surprising transformation of the premise.</comment>
