<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to preserve lost songs through dust mapping feels coherent, and her internal journey from loss to trust shows progression. However, the transformation lacks embodied emotional specificity—her grief and healing remain abstractly stated rather than viscerally felt through concrete action and perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered imagery (dust spirals, pigeon routes, meteorite fragments). The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lila learns "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new," but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatically enacted—we see the result of trust rebuilt but not the specific moments of risk that earned it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The attic setting with its skylight and dust motes creates atmospheric texture, and the meteorite chip functions as a concrete anchor. Yet the broader world remains vague—we never experience the "bustling streets below" or see how the city's geography constrains the pigeons' routes, missing opportunities for setting to pressure choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost songs through mapping—remains consistent but static. While the story describes weeks of trust-building with pigeons, no specific moment shows Lila risking failure or choosing between competing goods; the progression feels predetermined rather than contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of layering old with new emerges organically through the dust-mapping metaphor and achieves resonance in "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new, like moss blooming over stone." The meteorite's celestial melody connecting to earthbound memory creates genuine thematic texture, though the "lost songs" remain too abstract to fully land emotionally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled imagery ("dust motes into a slow, luminous whirl," "withering grace"). The voice suits the contemplative tone, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the inevitable wilt of memory") without sufficient grounding in Lila's specific perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "paper trails" appears 7 times with minimal variation; "lost songs" recurs 4 times without deepening. Lines like "She believed that preserving these trails could echo the lost songs" followed immediately by similar sentiment create redundancy. The prose achieves moments of beauty but suffers from conceptual repetition that dilutes impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeons with cosmic meteorite fragments offers an unexpected angle, and mapping dust spirals as navigation guides shows imaginative specificity. However, the emotional arc—moving from loss through ritual to renewed trust—follows a familiar therapeutic trajectory without surprising turns.</comment>
