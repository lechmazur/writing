<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as an "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is consistent and drives her actions, but internal conflict remains largely abstract ("stoically sensitive" reads as label rather than embodied contradiction). The final vow to return shows commitment but lacks the visceral cost or renunciation that would elevate the character work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>This reads as Accumulative/Textural with density increase toward the ending, but closure lacks decisive change or clear cost—Mara simply promises to return and continue her work. The piece teaches its lyric pattern of cataloguing and inscription but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion creates vivid atmosphere through "skeletal fingers" of columns and tactile details like "slick moss," with sensory work strongest in the water-wading sequence. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain Mara's choices or charge the final image beyond providing backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against oblivion—is signaled early but never faces real pressure or complication. No meaningful tightening occurs; Mara simply executes her plan without obstacle, reversal, or cost that would force a trade-off or narrow her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus oblivion emerges through concrete action (placing notes, using the inkwell) rather than abstract statement. However, the ending's promise to return doesn't offer a resonant answer to the central question—it simply extends the status quo without reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices everything with equal poetic weight rather than selective, character-specific bias. Phrases like "interlaced absence" repeat mechanically without evolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with metaphors in most sentences ("hushed blaze of damp copper," "skeleton fingers") creating density without purpose. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and "interlaced absence" loops four times without added meaning, creating synonym churn that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept of cataloguing abandoned structures offers a workable premise, but execution relies on familiar poetic moves (ruins as memory, water as time). The specific combination of inkwell-as-preservation tool shows some freshness but doesn't transform the core material beyond surface texture.</comment>
