<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The beautician mortician's dual expertise creates compelling tension between preservation and letting go, with her internal drive clearly motivated by the approaching oblivion. The character's micro-choices (closing eyes to feel vibrations, tracing invisible lines) reveal values under pressure. However, she lacks internal contradiction or struggle—her purpose never wavers, reducing complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the emerald chip becomes a beacon of hope against oblivion, with visible cost in the aurora's dimming. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through pattern-finding in static to the final charged image. Orientation anchors (skyborne grotto, aurora, beautician mortician) establish early. Deduction for somewhat abstract stakes that lack immediate personal cost beyond the cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto functions as more than backdrop—its threshold nature enables the spark transfer while the moonstone slab and ancient ice pillars constrain the ritual's execution. Sensory detail effectively balances visual aurora ribbons with tactile vibrations and the "radiant hush." The setting's suspended quality mirrors the temporal pause needed for the infusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving light before oblivion, with escalation through the pattern-finding process to successful infusion. The aurora's acknowledgment and final reignition provide cost visibility. However, no genuine obstacle threatens failure—the protagonist executes flawlessly without adaptation or struggle, limiting tension despite the cosmic stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of finding patterns in apparent chaos, suggesting meaning persists even in dissolution. The emerald chip as "beacon" for wanderers creates resonance beyond individual salvation. The covenant metaphor and "tapestry of existence" risk abstraction but remain grounded in the specific ritual. Final image of spark illuminating darkness effectively reweights the opening's "radiant hush."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm—"slow, trembling aurora" and "radiant hush" establish texture immediately. Perceptual signature shows in how she experiences static as physical pulse and reads light patterns others dismiss. Some elevated diction ("covenant with the universe") occasionally drifts from the intimate register but serves the mythic scope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("tapestry of existence," "honor every fleeting glow") and slight repetition of "radiant hush" and threshold concepts that edge toward loop territory without quite crossing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The beautician mortician who preserves cosmic light offers fresh synthesis—death-work expertise applied to universal preservation. Finding patterns in static as method for capturing light shows genuine ingenuity. The grotto as threshold space between states creates non-obvious resonance with the protagonist's dual role.</comment>
