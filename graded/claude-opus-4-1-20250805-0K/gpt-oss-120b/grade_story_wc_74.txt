<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's methodical hopefulness drives consistent action through painting and note-leaving, with Jiro's response validating her mission. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("mind forever wandering between waking and dreaming") rather than embodied, and the emotional cost of her insomnia and isolation isn't fully dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered imagery of moon, paint, and lost languages, culminating in Jiro's recognition moment that validates Mara's purpose. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "strangers, in turn, remembered the quiet power of a single kind gesture," though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse constrains and enables Mara's work through moonlight filtering, isolation from the city, and rain collection. Vivid sensory detail ("soot-stained glass lantern," "saffron quiet," "silver specks that danced") creates atmosphere that directly shapes her artistic process and the story's charged final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving "strangers remember kindness" through Mara's nightly ritual, with Jiro's arrival providing validation. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressurized—no meaningful obstacles test Mara's commitment or force trade-offs before the resolution arrives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image system of lost languages becoming visible through art and kindness. The final image of the greenhouse as "sanctuary where lost languages found voice" resonates without stating a moral, though the connection between language and kindness occasionally feels asserted rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyrical voice maintains consistent texture through selective perception ("waxing moon's glow," "silvered sap") and rhythm that supports the meditative tone. Some register elevation ("quiet conduit," "lexicon of remembrance") occasionally drifts from Mara's established perspective, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("saffron-lit bridge where lost languages of gratitude were spoken without words") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in "She painted...She brushed...She worked" sequences, and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("methodically hopeful" appears three times with minimal variation).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of visual art resurrecting lost languages through acts of kindness offers a fresh angle on connection between strangers. However, the execution leans heavily on established literary patterns (artist-as-conduit, rooftop-as-sanctuary) without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
