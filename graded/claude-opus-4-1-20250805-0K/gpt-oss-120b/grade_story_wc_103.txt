<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to dissolve perception boundaries is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The retrocognitive trap concept ("recalling futures as if they were already past") lacks concrete manifestation in choices or costs. The child's appearance provides external pressure, but Mara's internal conflict remains abstract without visible struggle between competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through the maze's transformation, but closure lacks decisive change or clear cost. The ending image of "endless discovery" provides atmospheric resolution without visible price paid or path foreclosed. The maze completes itself through abstract processes rather than character agency driving the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden and hyperbolic maze corridors create vivid, specific atmosphere that shapes the story's texture. Sensory details like "rain-kissed earth" and "vaporous threads" enrich the setting. However, the environment doesn't constrain Mara's choices or force trade-offs; it serves more as magical backdrop than pressure-creating space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of revealing "the texture of time" remains conceptual without concrete test or escalation. No meaningful tightening occurs—the maze simply manifests as designed without opposition or cost. The child's arrival doesn't create pressure that narrows Mara's options or forces difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of dissolving temporal boundaries emerges through the maze's properties and fading photographs, though it tends toward abstract philosophizing ("time could be felt as a tactile presence"). The final paragraph explicitly states thematic conclusions rather than letting them arise from dramatized cost. Conceptual ambition exceeds concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though it drifts into elevated diction ("mutable sanctuary," "retrocognitively trapped") that feels performative rather than character-rooted. POV remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond poetic observation. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in most sentences ("living sine wave," "Möbius strip of foliage," "trembling fabric") without pattern-teaching or payoff (-0.7). Abstract constructions like "texture of time" and "quaking reverie" obscure concrete action. Template phrases like "Mara understood," "Mara felt," "She believed" create filter-verb accumulation (-0.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of a living maze with hyperbolic geometry offers fresh imagery, and the retrocognitive perception adds originality. However, execution relies on accumulating poetic descriptions rather than transforming familiar elements through specific character struggle. The synthesis of time-perception and garden design shows creativity but lacks the inevitable-feeling integration of great speculative fiction.</comment>
