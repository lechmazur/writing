<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation to preserve wonder in routine is consistent and drives his choice to forge the memory key, though his internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene. The transformation from guardian to facilitator shows earned change with visible cost (his gears softening, accepting migration). Some abstract phrasing ("accepting contradictions") weakens peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the librarian accepts identity migration and creates participatory stories. Cost is visible in his softening gears and releasing control. The "tomorrow disappeared" element disrupts orientation briefly but pays off thematically. Closure lands with felt transformation though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as active setting—water rises with moon phases, affecting the librarian's gears and story transformations. Sensory detail is selective (brine and cedar scent, pale teal water) and filtered through the librarian's mechanical perception. The bamboo creel and memory key constrain choices and charge the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Central tension between preserving stories versus allowing them to migrate escalates through the key-forging decision. The librarian's agency drives the resolution though external pressure remains gentle. Cost appears in his physical transformation (gears softening) and relinquishing control to visitors, meeting the single meaningful deepening requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of accepting paradox emerges through concrete images—fire that doesn't burn, water that doesn't drown, migrating identities. The final image of empty scrolls awaiting visitor contributions offers a non-literal answer to preserving wonder through participation. Avoids moralizing while achieving resonance through the creel-as-beacon transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent omniscient voice with controlled mythic register appropriate to the fable-like tone. Some elevated diction ("wintersun serenity," "tidal atrium") fits the fantastical setting though occasionally drifts toward purple. Perceptual signature emerges through mechanical metaphors (gears turning, bronze cogs) that distinguish the librarian's experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Several abstract phrases weaken clarity ("accepting contradictions" appears multiple times without concrete embodiment). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("wintersun serenity," "migrating identities") but doesn't obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian concept offers fresh specificity—a mechanical being wrestling with fluid identity. The memory key forged from contradiction and the participatory library transform familiar elements. Some safety in the resolution (everyone leaves with "quiet gratitude") prevents higher scoring.</comment>
