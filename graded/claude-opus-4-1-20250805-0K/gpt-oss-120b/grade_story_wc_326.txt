I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical resonance, with the ink patterns and digital ghost creating textural density that culminates in a conceptual repricing.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal struggle between bureaucratic death and actual life creates genuine tension, and her methodical approach to the ghost reveals character through action. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract—we understand her predicament intellectually but don't feel the visceral fear of erasure. The porcelain shard choice shows agency but lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Mara recognizes the ghost as mirror rather than threat, with clear cost (her legal non-existence). The hybrid lens holds as accumulative patterns (ink, heartbeats, resonance) build toward causal resolution. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence where understanding arrives too cleanly through the ghost's "crystalline whispers."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal observatory creates an effective isolating atmosphere that constrains choice—the snow muffles external help, forcing Mara's solitary confrontation. The porcelain shard and ink patterns function as micro-settings that directly enable the solution. Strong sensory work with the "frozen lantern" and tactile details of cold shard against warm pulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recovering true identity from digital corruption) escalates through the ink ritual's progression, but agency feels limited—Mara follows a predetermined algorithm rather than making costly choices under pressure. The ghost's heartbeat synchronization creates tension, yet the resolution lacks a moment where Mara must sacrifice or risk something tangible beyond what she's already lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of identity persistence despite bureaucratic erasure emerges organically through the ghost-as-mirror revelation. The porcelain shard accumulates meaning from broken teacup to data conduit to destiny-rewriter. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement about "ensuring no death certificate would ever again be signed by a glitch" veers toward moralizing, diminishing the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with scientific precision meeting poetic observation ("frozen lantern," "cascade of code"). The voice maintains consistency through technical and lyrical registers. Minor issues with occasional overwriting ("indifferent sky," "crystalline whispers") that push toward purple prose without fully committing to a heightened register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwrought figurative language creates density issues—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated diction ("frozen lantern," "legal phantom," "ephemeral patterns," "crystalline whispers"). Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She realized... She stepped... She smiled..."). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but sacrifices momentum to ornamentation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of debugging one's own death through ink-based algorithms offers genuine originality. The synthesis of bureaucratic horror with quantum computing and divination creates a fresh angle on identity crisis. The porcelain shard as data conduit shows inventive thinking, though the ghost's ultimate benevolence feels somewhat safe.</comment>
