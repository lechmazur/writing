I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, with the phoenix motif and artistic creations creating density that reweights meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from destroyer to guardian tracks coherently, but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to become a guardian is earned through the discovered promise, though internal conflict lacks scene-level friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the arsonist's transformation into guardian, with visible cost in his redemptive murals. However, the accumulative structure suffers from excessive backstory (~35% of text) that summarizes rather than dramatizes key discoveries, and the phoenix revelation feels mechanically convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive and its murals create atmospheric pressure, particularly the "walls carpeted with murals" and "echoing chambers where dust danced like ash." The desert canyon setting constrains the search effectively, though some descriptions lean generic ("sandstone," "bronze box").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the trail of artistic discoveries leading to the mentor's promise, with each fragment adding meaning. The cost appears in the protagonist's shift from destruction to preservation, though the escalation lacks visceral stakes—the discovery sequence proceeds without meaningful opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The phoenix-as-redemption theme emerges organically through the tapestry fragment and final murals, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of stories as fire that can "melt steel and soften stone" creates resonance, though "volcanic tenderness" appears four times, diluting its impact through repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the protagonist's "analytically intuitive" nature rarely manifests in specific observational patterns. Prose tends toward elevated register ("volcanic tenderness rise within him") that doesn't align with an arsonist's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues: "volcanic tenderness" appears four times, "analytically intuitive" twice, creating template cadence. The phrase "rescued a promise" and variations appear five times. Some sentences achieve lyric beauty ("dust danced like ash"), but paraphrase loops and abstract descriptors ("fierce love tempered by gentle heat") reduce precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core concept of an arsonist becoming guardian of stories offers genuine freshness, particularly the inversion of fire from destroyer to illuminator. The lost civilization's belief that "narratives could melt steel" provides non-obvious depth, though execution relies on familiar redemption arc patterns.</comment>
