<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elya's motivation to rebuild after loss is clear, but her internal state remains largely abstract ("trembling," "tingling") without embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final choice to create vessels with hidden compartments shows some earned development, though the transformation lacks visible cost beyond the initial fire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery leading to artistic renewal. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elya integrates the smuggler's methods into her art, though the cost remains primarily retrospective (the fire) rather than arising from present choices. The frost patterns create coherent linkage but the transformation feels somewhat predetermined.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The canyon setting and frost patterns provide vivid sensory detail, particularly the "glassy hush" and "basalt floor" specifics. However, the environment functions more as backdrop than constraint—the hidden path and abandoned mine don't force difficult choices, merely enable discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of artistic rebirth is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening through opposition. The journey follows a steady accumulation without reversals or trade-offs; finding the luminous glass shards feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose through loss emerges organically through the parallel between smuggler's survival and artist's rebirth. The recurring frost patterns effectively link destruction and creation, though the final insight about "quiet pauses where light lingered" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elya notices everything with equal poetic weight ("glassy hush," "luminous shards," "drifting resonance"). The repetitive "steadily adaptive" and template phrases like "scorched testament" suggest mechanical insertion rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe template cadence throughout: "She [verb]" opens most sentences, creating monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops ("drifting resonance" appears 4 times unchanged) and overwrought figurative language in nearly every sentence ("glass towers," "black snow," "amber light") obscure rather than clarify. The final third particularly suffers from synonym churn around the same concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artistry with smuggler's frost-pattern navigation offers a moderately fresh angle, though the execution relies on familiar rebirth-through-destruction tropes. The specific detail of incorporating hidden compartments into glass vessels shows some originality but doesn't transform the archetypal journey.</comment>
