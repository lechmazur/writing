<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's motivation to "listen for unheard stories" drives consistent action through stitching patterns synchronized with flame rhythms, though her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The final choice to send the chart creates change but lacks visceral cost—we see ash but not what she sacrifices or risks by exposing the conspiracy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building toward sending the chart, but closure lacks visible cost beyond the ember becoming ash. The conspiracy's exposure happens off-page through a courier, deflating the stakes established throughout. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory with brass domes and glass roof creates atmospheric specificity, and the flame's heat traveling through silk provides tactile detail. However, setting rarely constrains choices—the observatory could be any isolated workspace without affecting the embroiderer's actions or the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes around preventing the coup through exposing conspiracies are declared but remain abstract—we never see what the coup would cost the city or what sending the chart risks for the embroiderer. The pattern of flame-reading to stitch-mapping provides texture but no escalating pressure that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths emerging through patient observation resonates through the flame-reading and galaxy-chart metaphor. However, the ending's assertion that "History would remember the fire's glow, not the blade" tells rather than dramatizes the thematic payoff, and "truth could be sewn" reads as explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled imagery ("sky bruised with dying stars," "loom of light"), though some phrases drift toward purple prose. POV remains stable in third-limited, and the mystical tone suits the concept without dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "echoed silence" appears three times with minimal variation, and the conspiracy revelation repeats across lines 19-24 without advancing. Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions, though figurative language generally coheres within the mystical register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of reading conspiracies through flame patterns synchronized with embroidery offers a fresh angle on political intrigue. However, execution relies on abstract pattern-reading rather than specific, grounded details that would make this particular conspiracy and its prevention memorable.</comment>
