I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery and symbolic accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics. The lens/projector motif, the repeated "ambiguously clear" phrase, and the crystalline forecourt's transformative properties create a density pattern that culminates in collective revelation.

<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara functions more as a witnessing consciousness than an active agent with internal contradiction. Her motivations remain abstract ("thoughts folded like origami") without embodied emotional specificity. The piece relies on conceptual gestures rather than concrete character particulars, though her role as illuminator rather than judge provides some coherence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the town's collective transformation, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres around the transparency theme, yet the actual mechanism of change (lens projecting confessions) strains credibility without earned setup. No specific, visible price is paid by any character.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt functions as more than backdrop, becoming the canvas for truth's revelation and constraining the story's possibilities. Strong sensory work with "puddles that caught the last dim light" and "air smelled of dust and old velvet." The setting actively participates in the transformation, though some descriptions veer toward the precious.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "thawing mistrust with transparency" is declared but never tested through concrete opposition. No meaningful escalation occurs—Mara simply follows clues, finds equipment, and witnesses transformation without facing resistance or paying a price. The resolution happens to the town rather than through earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The transparency/honesty theme emerges clearly through the lens metaphor and accumulating imagery of light, reflection, and revelation. However, the thematic work remains somewhat abstract, relying on conceptual assertions ("honesty had freed them") rather than dramatized particulars. The final image of ongoing documentation provides some resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with its lyrical register but suffers from overwriting ("thoughts folded like origami," "resonant hush"). Some effective moments like "eavesdrop through ink rather than ear" show originality, but repetitive constructions ("She saw...She recorded...She noticed") create monotony. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Significant overwriting throughout with mixed metaphors and purple prose ("crystal whispering forecourt," "chorus of murmurs that felt like words after words become unnecessary"). Template repetition of "ambiguously clear" without earned payoff. Paraphrase loops evident in the repeated descriptions of transparency and honesty. The prose often obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of using a projector lens to make invisible truths visible offers some originality, and the notion of "eavesdropping through ink" is fresh. However, the execution relies on familiar tropes of collective redemption through truth-telling. The specific mechanics feel more magical than earned, reducing the story's distinctive impact.</comment>
