<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The "solemn playfulness" appears as a label rather than dramatized tension. Her final handoff of the pen nib represents a genuine choice with some cost, though the emotional progression feels overly smooth without credible irrationality under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Decisive Change (ledger discovered, accountability initiated) with visible cost implied through "orbits of regret" unwinding. However, the causal chain from pen nib to decryption feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through struggle. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting provides functional atmosphere but doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—Mira could have decoded the ledger anywhere with a console. Sensory details like "telescope pipes humming" and "glassy sphere" create texture without advancing pressure. The rosewood pen nib functions more as a key than an object shaped by its environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (exposing corruption) is signaled early but escalation occurs through convenient discovery rather than protagonist struggle. The console accepting the pen nib and instantly solving the cipher eliminates tension rather than tightening it. No meaningful reversal or cost forces Mira to sacrifice anything substantial for her victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" concept provides coherent thematic throughline about cyclical corruption, though it tends toward abstraction. The proof by contradiction method offers intellectual resonance but lacks embodied struggle. The ending's promise of accountability emerges from events rather than being stated, though the journalist's arrival feels thematically convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice shows distinct texture through phrases like "ink once fell like rain on dead stories" though occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lattice of possibilities"). The absent dialogue until the journalist's arrival creates purposeful compression that serves the solitary discovery beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("floating thought, solemn yet playful"). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical excess ("orbits of regret that anchored the city's most whispered conspiracies") but no major loops or scaffolding that obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fusion of newsroom legacy with astronomical observatory offers moderate freshness, and "proof by contradiction" as decryption method shows some ingenuity. However, the core premise of uncovering corruption through hidden documents follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
