I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered fragments, filtered perceptions, and accumulating memories that reweight meaning at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The unnamed narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in their bureaucratic erasure, driving the search for "erased histories." Internal experience is concrete through sensory filtering and the texture of memories. The final choice to become "the unnamed keeper" shows earned endurance with visible cost - accepting permanent marginality to preserve others' stories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator accepting their role as "unnamed keeper," with clear cost of remaining forever marginal. The accumulative lens holds as fragments layer into meaning. The orientation anchors (port, containers, narrator's dead status) establish by ~100 words. Deduct -0.2 for slight ambiguity in how the label mechanism works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The port setting with "towering labyrinth of shipping containers" creates vivid spatial maze that mirrors thematic disorientation. Sensory details filter through POV effectively ("sepia hue," "cold filament"). The poison label as micro-setting object constrains choices and charges the final image of the narrator as keeper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake - recovering erased histories - escalates through discovery of the label's power to project hidden stories. Meaningful deepening occurs when narrator realizes they're a "conduit for the forgotten." Cost is visible in accepting permanent namelessness, though the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and memory emerges organically through concrete details without explicit moralizing. The label as filter/key creates resonant metaphor for how perspective shapes reality. Final image of "stitching the world back together" offers non-literal answer to the central question of recovering lost stories.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with poetic compression and purposeful repetition ("layers filter reality differently"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature strong through filtering metaphors. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("palimpsest of voices") slightly beyond character's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm and varied syntax, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("rusted bones," "thin paper," "cold filament" in close succession). Information density generally high with purposeful compression. Deduct -0.5 for repetitive "erased histories" phrase and -0.2 for slight template cadence in middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of bureaucratic erasure creating a liminal archive-keeper offers fresh angle on memory and identity. The poison label as reality filter is inventive. Story commits to its conceptual premise without retreat, though the execution occasionally relies on familiar literary tropes of fragmentation and palimpsest.</comment>
