I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "find the sacred in the ordinary" drives consistent micro-choices through bread discovery and tea ceremony, with embodied reverence ("lifted the loaf with reverence"). However, interiority relies on abstract labels ("tenuous absolution," "heuristically gentle") rather than concrete embodiment, and no meaningful internal conflict or contradiction acts in scene—the character proceeds without resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>This reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern-building through garden/palace/bread imagery culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tea house "uncloak[s] its hidden purpose." However, no visible cost appears on-page—the bread's discovery and sharing create atmosphere without foreclosing options or exacting price. The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words (palace, twilight, gardener-figure).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard with "cracked marble arches," "collapsed columns," and secret tea house creates vivid tactile setting that the protagonist navigates purposefully. Sensory details balance sight/scent/taste effectively ("jasmine mingled with steaming oolong," "taste of the crust"). The guerrilla garden and vine-wrapped architecture constrain movement and shape the discovery, though they don't force a costly choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding meaning in ruins signals early but never faces pressure or complication—the protagonist discovers bread, carries it to tea house, shares it symbolically without obstacle or trade-off. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens; density increases but doesn't narrow options or force choice. The "tenuous absolution" arrives without earning through conflict or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming sacred meaning from abandonment emerges through concrete images (guerrilla garden, preserved bread, secret tea house) rather than statement. The bread becomes "a quiet altar" and empty chair accepts offering, creating resonance through particulars. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined without complexity—no counter-force challenges the protagonist's quest for meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("creeping normality noticer slipped through"). However, abstract register ("tenuous absolution," "heuristically gentle") clashes with the embodied scene work, creating distance. The POV filters setting effectively but relies on elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies the emotional core.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repeated abstract phrases ("tenuous absolution" 3x, "heuristically gentle" 2x, "uncloak" 3x) that become loops rather than purposeful pattern. Overwriting appears in mixed metaphors ("bloom of a weed as a confession") and elevated register inappropriate for scene pressure. Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" constructions, though some lyrical passages achieve genuine rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The guerrilla garden in abandoned palace offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic recovery, and the preserved bread from vanished bakery creates specific mystery. However, execution relies on abstract philosophical language rather than grounded particulars, and the "finding sacred in ordinary" theme follows predictable arc without transformation or surprise.</comment>
