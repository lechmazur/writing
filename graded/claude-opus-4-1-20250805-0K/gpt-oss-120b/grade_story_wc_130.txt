I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage. The mathematics metaphor, recurring glass eyes, and orchard imagery create density that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation remains abstract ("gently inventive," "mathematics of emotion") without concrete embodiment of his emotional state. His actions follow a ritual pattern but lack internal contradiction or cost - he performs his task and leaves satisfied. The "ambiguous loss" never manifests as specific character pain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation of loss into growth ("grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth"). However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt - the conjurer experiences no visible sacrifice or struggle. The accumulative lens holds but the closure lacks dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric work with the cavern orchard, dripping stalactites, and moonlit setting creating a dreamlike space. The mosaic stone functions as micro-setting that enables the ritual. Sensory details are selective and support the mystical tone effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding/transforming loss) never faces real pressure or opposition. The conjurer proceeds through his ritual without obstacles, discoveries that change tactics, or meaningful choices. The "equation" resolves too easily without earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mathematical metaphor for emotion creates thematic coherence, and the transformation of loss into growth resonates. However, the theme statement becomes explicit ("grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth") rather than remaining implicit. The final image of "buried optimism and ever-lasting wonder" provides resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent mystical voice with controlled diction and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting ("secretive conjurer slipped through the amber fog") but maintains atmospheric texture. The perceptual signature stays focused on the magical-mathematical lens throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwritten with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("silver shadows," "pale lanterns," "amber fog"). Multiple paraphrase loops: "ambiguous loss" repeated verbatim three times; "buried optimism" appears twice. Template cadence in "He carried...He placed...He traced...He walked." The prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity and momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mathematical framework for emotion offers a fresh angle, and the glass eyes as conduits for orchard healing shows inventive synthesis. However, the execution remains safe - the conjurer succeeds without complication, and the resolution feels predetermined rather than discovered.</comment>
