I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery and pattern recognition, culminating in a conceptual repricing about the nature of intentions.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and his ritualistic actions reveal character through specific gestures like "tenderly organized" compartments and careful untangling of threads. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract concepts ("shape of intentions") without sufficient embodied emotional complexity, and the character lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle beyond his philosophical quest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where intentions are revealed as "not a weapon but a seed," with the gardener's understanding creating a resonant reconfiguration. The accumulative structure builds through tapestry revelations and the sovereign case's transformative properties, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cemetery setting with its "cobalt silo" and "velveteen gloom" creates distinctive atmosphere that shapes the gardener's ritual timing and movements. The antique sovereign case functions as micro-setting with its compartments that "adjusted to fit the new parchment like a lover's embrace," directly constraining and enabling the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "the shape of intentions"—is signaled early and deepens through the Marlowe revelation, where misread cowardice becomes healing intention. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure; the gardener faces no real opposition or cost beyond patient untangling, making the resolution feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tapestry's revelation that intentions can be misread, culminating in the seed metaphor that reframes memory work as generative rather than archaeological. The circular shape of intentions binding "past and future together" offers genuine complexity without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinctive phrases like "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes," though occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("monolith that seemed to swallow the moonlight") that strains against the gardener's humble occupation. The perceptual signature is selective and atmospheric but lacks the granular specificity of lived experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. However, abstract phrases like "uncharted echoes of memory rise like mist" and "shape of intentions" recur without sufficient concretization, and some metaphors strain credibility ("compartments adjusted...like a lover's embrace" for an inanimate case).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cemetery gardener as keeper of forgotten intentions offers a fresh angle on memory work, and the tapestry's border as repository of truth inverts expectations. The synthesis of healing map and misread cowardice creates non-obvious moral complexity, though the piece plays somewhat safe with its philosophical abstractions.</comment>
