<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser's motivation to prove gardens reward careful hands is clear but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle. His patient polishing and eventual crowning show consistent traits, yet emotional complexity remains abstract ("dual nature," "blooming withering") without concrete embodiment. The character achieves change through labor but without dramatized internal conflict pulling in opposing directions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through marble polishing that culminates in garden recognition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden crowns its keeper, though cost remains primarily metaphorical ("weight of both bloom and rot"). The piece teaches its symbolic system early but the transformation from "mended deception" to "shining pathways" lacks a concrete price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The garden maze setting with its "pulsing rhythm" and "breathing walls" creates atmosphere but rarely constrains specific choices. Sensory detail focuses heavily on visual ("glimmered," "shone," "glistened") with minimal other senses. The environment does charge the final crowning image when vines twine around his arms, satisfying the constraint requirement minimally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving the garden's awareness through marble polishing, with escalation occurring through accumulation (each polished marble opens new pathways). The dominant stake remains consistent but pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten—the garden responds positively throughout without forcing trade-offs. Cost stays abstract ("blooming withering," "fragile yet fierce triumphs") rather than manifesting as concrete loss or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal awareness between gardener and garden emerges through action but relies heavily on abstract declarations ("gardens know their gardeners," "blooming withering symphony"). The cracked marbles as "mended deception" carry symbolic weight yet the concept remains opaque. Final paragraph explicitly states the thematic message ("Your wisely pragmatic heart has turned cracked promises into shining pathways"), reducing resonance through directness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though diction occasionally elevates beyond the character's established perspective ("commemorating small victories elaborately"). The garden's direct speech feels forced rather than earned through prior personification. Perceptual signature exists in the attention to surfaces and textures but lacks distinctive bias beyond general poetic observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract density ("blooming withering," "tentative bloom," "measured steps") and repetitive figurative constructions. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("He lifted...He whispered...He sensed...He knelt"). The phrase "commemorating small victories elaborately" reads as awkward construction that disrupts flow. Information density is moderate but clarity diminishes under accumulated abstractions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a sentient garden recognizing its keeper offers a fresh angle on gardener-garden relationships. The "luck becomes measurable" worldbuilding element and probability gauge add originality. However, execution relies on familiar mystical garden tropes and the resolution follows expected patterns of mutual recognition without surprising transformation.</comment>
