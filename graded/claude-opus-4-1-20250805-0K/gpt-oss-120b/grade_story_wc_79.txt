<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and builds from curiosity to mission, with concrete embodied choices (tracing shell patterns, following whistle resonance). The transformation from cartographer to pattern-keeper shows earned change through discovery. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract statements ("a calm current beneath the city's bright glare") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final vow feels slightly unearned given the limited struggle shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-discovery driving escalation through mosaic crack, hidden passage, and light-language revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira realizes the expedition "became part of the pattern" with visible cost (the city's isolation). The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt, and the final vow to "keep listening, forever" lacks the weight of dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city creates a vivid, constraining environment where geography literally shapes movement ("narrow stone corridors that curled like the shells themselves"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (amber dread, sea-green glow). The setting actively drives choices through the cracked mosaic map and sun-triggered passage. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("horizon stretched like a molten ribbon") that prioritizes prettiness over precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing fossilization) is signaled early but remains largely abstract. Escalation occurs through pattern-discovery beats that deepen understanding rather than raise concrete cost. The revelation about the expedition provides meaningful reweighting, but agency feels limited—Mira observes and interprets more than she chooses under pressure. The "sunwashed dread" dissolving to "quiet resolve" suggests emotional shift without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pattern-language concept—communication beyond words, connection through geometry and resonance. The reed whistle becomes a thematic bridge between human and non-human understanding. The ending's revelation that "the true lost expedition was...the city's own willingness to listen" offers resonant repricing without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for the final "forever" which edges toward sentiment over earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("spiral-shell cartographer whose maps spiraled outward"). The prose modulates effectively between description and discovery. However, diction occasionally drifts into unnecessarily ornate constructions ("gargantuan turtles that trudged eternally") and filter phrases appear without clear voice motivation ("Mira understood that").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance world, character, or atmosphere simultaneously. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with clarity ("bronze ribs of iron," "molten ribbon"), and some repetitive structures emerge ("She traced...She raised...She tucked"). The filter-verb cluster in the revelation sequence ("Mira understood...Mira realized...she vowed") dulls immediacy at a crucial moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-city premise offers genuine freshness, and the pattern-language concept provides non-obvious angle on communication themes. The revelation that the expedition "became part of the pattern" transforms expected rescue narrative into integration story. Specific details like "spiral-shell cartographer" and shell-ridge language show imaginative synthesis. Minor deduction for safety in emotional range—the story maintains mythic distance rather than risking messier human complexity.</comment>
