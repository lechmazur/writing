<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to "translate silence into music" is clear and drives the harbor ritual, but characterization relies heavily on abstract poetic descriptions rather than embodied contradiction. The transfer to Lira provides continuity but lacks the internal conflict needed for higher bands—both characters operate as lyrical vessels rather than conflicted individuals making costly choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Arlen's ritual creating the harbor's silent music, then Lira discovering and continuing the practice. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Lira's vow to "return to map silence" carries no stakes or sacrifice. The Resonant Reconfiguration attempts to land through "creation thrives even in forgotten moments" but remains conceptually abstract without dramatized price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor setting effectively constrains the ritual through moonlight, waves, and pier architecture, with sensory details like "silver sigh" and "kelp and nostalgia" creating atmosphere. The empty camera and sign language gestures function as micro-settings that shape the central action, though the piece could ground physical choreography more precisely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating music from silence to soothe forgotten souls—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. The ritual proceeds without obstacle, and Lira's continuation lacks any trade-off or narrowing of options. No meaningful tightening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the piece maintains steady atmospheric pressure without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in absence emerges organically through the harbor ritual, with "joyful sorrow" and "mapping silence" avoiding direct statement. The ending image of Lira walking toward cliffs to continue the practice resonates thematically, though the piece would benefit from more concrete particulars to ground its abstract concepts about memory and creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "mute grammar" and "living stave," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—both Arlen and Lira perceive the world through identical poetic filters. The elevated diction ("luminous," "tableau," "choreography") creates distance rather than immediacy, and the voice convergence between characters suggests a single authorial presence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("silver sigh," "frozen memories," "mute grammar," "living stave") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She lifted...She pressed...She walked"). The prose prioritizes poetic effect over clarity, with abstract phrases like "creation thrives even in forgotten moments" replacing concrete resolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of translating sign language into harbor music offers a fresh angle, and the image of the empty camera as a tool for "mapping silence" shows originality. However, execution relies on abstract poetic assertions rather than grounded specifics, and the piece doesn't fully commit to its premise's implications—we never experience the actual music or its effect on the "souls who remembered nothing."</comment>
