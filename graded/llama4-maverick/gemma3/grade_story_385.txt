<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hospital ward and obsidian skyscraper create a vivid atmosphere, and the pre-sunrise quiet effectively enhances the mood. The beach setting for Thorne's nighttime walks adds a contrasting element that enriches the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story evokes a sense of intrigue and curiosity, with effective use of symbolism (ice skates, footprints, seeds) and metaphor (weakening footprints). The narrative has subtext and deeper meaning, and the ending feels purposeful.</comment>
