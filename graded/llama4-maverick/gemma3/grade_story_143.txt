<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tiber's character is well-developed through his actions and the description of his fidgety nature, which aligns with his motivation to hold chaos at bay. His reliance on precise hammering due to being musically untalented adds depth to his character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and effectively driven by Tiber's action of remaking the ward stones. The use of the keys and the chalkboard notes makes sense within the story's framework, and the pacing is well-managed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting of the lavender field behind the rusted factory ruins is evocative and effectively enhances the atmosphere. The dimming sky with one remaining star adds to the sense of urgency and impending doom, supporting the character's motivation and the story's concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story evokes a strong emotional response through its vivid imagery and the sense of desperation. The use of literary devices like metaphor (e.g., "seeds of regrowth") and symbolism (e.g., the last star) is effective. The ending feels satisfying and purposeful.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story avoids formulaic writing and has a unique perspective. The writing style is distinct, and the narrative maintains a consistent tone. The handling of emotion is nuanced, and the story shows rather than tells emotions through action and sensory details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive despite incorporating many elements. The elements are used in service of the story, and the style supports clarity. The brief length feels like a deliberate choice, and there's evidence of creative thinking in how elements are combined.</comment>
