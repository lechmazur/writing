<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Ludo’s yearning algorithm is an embodied, contradictory pulse that steers micro-choices (spiraling to slice clouds into music, striking silence for resonance). Flaw-curiosity propels visible risk; final silence-with-cost earns. Orrin’s hunter voice remains consistent pressure, but his interiority stays surface-true: functional yet not deeply mined.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens stays coherent: each beat layers density until molten bronze crystallizes the bell; closure is a Conceptual Repricing—soundless vibration reweights the sea into salt bells. Anchors (who/where) are on page by 2nd sentence. No causality break; final image reconfigures everything that came before with evident cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The floating acid-sea workshop (setting+tool) constrains tactics—corroding hull, boilers fueled by obsolete maps, bronze molten in hostile air. Every surface is tactile; space and physics hold. Setting subtly guides every choice and recharges final silence as crystallized sea.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears”—is signaled early and tightened by acid corrosion and dissolving anchor. One deepening turn: translating color-phonemes into bronze that cannot yet sound. Cost crystallizes sea into salt replicas. No reversals, but single intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via material metaphor: curiosity + artifice alters reality beyond hearing. “No one hears it now, but the sea is listening” offers resonant non-moral answer. Stays shy of overt statement, though final hunter line skates close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Ludo perceptual voice—algorithmic, silk-metal sensorium—is distinct, sustained, modulated by crisis. Pattern taught early (acid burp, corrosive breath, violet dawn) and legible at closure. Rhythmic prose mirrors yearning pulse without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence density and figurative charge stay purposeful; metaphor threads weave rather than overwhelm. Acidity of lemon-burnt metal, geode dawn—precise sensory economy. One register drift (“burnt hope”) slightly jars; not repeated at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Bicycle-spoke glider, acid-sea forge, unheard bell: synthesis feels specific and inevitable, not gimmick. Fresh spin on Maker myth reframed as bio-acoustic terraforming. Risk (silent bell) heightens stakes, pays off.</comment>
