<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the slide, the hammer of her heart—but the older Mara remains a cipher, flattening the relationship crucible. The driftwood sculptor identity is embodied through action (carving, lashing) rather than label, and the final renunciation carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the empty slide projects the next loop, making the before/after of stewardship legible. Causality is tight—every alliance spirals forward—and the 650-word mosaic holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is not backdrop but pressure: its ribs vibrate, its shadow anchors orientation after GPS failure, and its rebuilt driftwood heart beats with borrowed time. Micro-setting (the lantern crate at dawn) constrains the final wait.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to keep the loop of alliances alive—escalates through each arrival: cartographer, musician, sailor, child. Each adds a plank or chime, tightening the spiral until the blank slide forces Mara to reimagine again. Cost is felt in the perpetual return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: alliances as spirals, not chains, scaffolded by the simplest knot. The final image of the empty slide reweights every prior gift as future obligation, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded—“turbine-hum reverie,” “grain still remembered”—with rhythmic control that modulates under storm pressure. No head-hopping; older Mara’s speech is distinct in cadence and diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “threads of light weaving outward,” “questions stacked like vertebrae.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language serves the accumulative design without muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The time-loop mentor-self trope is transformed through tactile driftwood craft and communal layering, making the familiar premise feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky circular structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
