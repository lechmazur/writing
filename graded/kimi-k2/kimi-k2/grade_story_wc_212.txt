<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the seed-saver’s contradictory impulses—yearning to open the spiral yet fearing its rupture—play out in micro-choices (placing seeds, touching the membrane). The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost: she seals the vortex and accepts stewardship rather than possession. One notch below 9.0 because the “texture of borrowed time” remains slightly abstract, blunting the cost’s edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral folds back, the acorn cap is pocketed, and the keeper’s stance crystallizes with visible cost—she must now live the letter she begins. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed-spiral → vortex → resealed spiral reweights the premise. No causality breaks; orientation is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound atrium, cracked dome, and Fibonacci seed array are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action—cold limits touch, starlight guides placement. The acorn cap itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. One hairline slip: “furiously tranquil” is asserted more than enacted by the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inheritance as responsibility versus possession—tightens when the membrane threatens to tear; her choice to seal rather than seize narrows future options. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate knowledge and assumes lifelong guardianship. Escalation is single but decisive under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: inheritance is permission, not property. The final image—acorn cap beating beside her heart—offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior seed-memory. No moralizing; complexity remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“low hum… like glaciers deciding to forgive”). Perceptual signature is distinct: scientific diction (“decreasing entropy”) braided with mythic cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and concept without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“reverse avalanche returning to the peak”). Zero loops or scaffold; clarity never falters at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes climate grief, quantum mysticism, and seed stewardship into a singular, non-obvious whole. The “vortex inheritance” trope is transformed through tactile ritual and generational memory. Risk-taking (entropy reversal as spiritual practice) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
