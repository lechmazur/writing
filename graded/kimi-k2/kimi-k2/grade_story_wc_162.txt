<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iona’s interiority is embodied and specific—kneeling, tracing grain, knees trembling—yet the father’s sudden reappearance and tidy exposition (“I built the maze to teach you…”) undercuts the earned cost of her three-year separation. The final silence is credible, but the reunion feels frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze folds, the terrace settles, and the father-daughter distance is reweighted with felt cost. Causal chain holds—weather code → grain reading → threshold crossing—though the father’s survival is lightly motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, glass creak, and corn-maze shimmer are vivid and selective; the terrace’s final settling directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reunion across sacred distance—tightens once when the maze opens its silver corridor. Cost is visible (Iona’s trembling step onto the rail), but escalation is single-note; no secondary pressure complicates the path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of sacred thresholds earned by necessary distance emerges organically from grain rings, weather code, and the folding maze. Final image of sanding the chair reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“featherly determination,” “shattered butterflies”—with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Iona; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“shattered butterflies” echoes the butterfly effect). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction fits the fabulist tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-code divination, drifting control-deck terrace, and maze-as-prayer feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky fabulist elements heighten stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
