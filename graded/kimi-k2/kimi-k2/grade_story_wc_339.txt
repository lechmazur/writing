<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressure mirrors the one pressing against my ribs”), but the protagonist’s analytic stance keeps emotion at a cool distance; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the mingling of 1937 sky with 2023 water reweights the entire premise; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the leaking globe shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned library is not mere backdrop; its silt, coral throne, and rusted chandelier physically constrain movement and echo the theme of inevitable surrender, charging the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightened once through the act of releasing the globe; the cost is the relinquishment of proof, felt in the empty palms offered topside.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the literal act of release; the final dissolved sentence reconfigures the entire narrative without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature that notices “salt and ink” and “candle smoke”; patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the final blizzard broadcast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; only a faint echo of stacked metaphors near the coral throne keeps it from 9.0. Every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes, and the final image is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The Earhart myth is transformed into a meditation on surrender rather than discovery; the leaking snow globe is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
