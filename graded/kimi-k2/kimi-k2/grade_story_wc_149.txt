<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"her voice like wind through dead leaves"—but the ghost bride’s contradictory impulses (love vs betrayal) are summarized rather than enacted in-scene, keeping her final forgiveness slightly abstract rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bead’s dissolution and dawn’s crack constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each luminous fruit, frost touch, and resonant awakening tightens toward the final release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s black glass and glowing fruit constrain every move; the oldest tree’s brightest fruit literally cages the alchemist’s soul, charging the final image when it dims at dawn. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repaying the soul-debt—is signaled early and tightened through each resonant awakening until the bead’s dissolution forecloses further wandering. Cost is visible: the bride’s own dissolution and the orchard’s loss of magic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of love transcending betrayal emerges through concrete particulars—poisoned elixir, glowing fruit, bead etched with shifting symbols—without moralizing. Final image of ordinary fruit under clear glass offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“ephemeral cameo appearances”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and perceptual signature is consistent—frost, ash, starlight filtered through centuries of regret.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“glowed like captive stars”—and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the bride’s fading, earning the quiet closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar ghost-lover tropes into a fresh alchemical myth; the bead as portable soul-cage and the orchard as afterlife engine feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
