<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia and hope are embodied in tactile choices—twirling the brush, painting glyphs—rather than labels. The final refusal to sleep carries cost: the brush dissolves, a visible forfeiture. Interiority is specific and sensory, not diagnostic. The only gap: the janitor’s sudden tearful confession feels externally supplied, not filtered through Mira’s strained perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted glyphs ascend, reconfiguring the city’s night sky and Mira’s stance toward sleep. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each saffron stroke thickens moonlight until the manuscript detaches. The Orientation Test is met by line 3. One minor wobble: the pigeon’s speech momentarily externalizes causality, but the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, iron grating, and drifting saffron haze anchor every move; the glass ceiling literally becomes the canvas that constrains and enables the climax. Micro-setting—the moon-tipped brush—functions as setting-object hybrid, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: turmeric scent, pigeon’s twin-moon eyes. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mira rouse enough remembered kindness to justify her sleepless vigil? Pressure tightens as moonlight thickens and the brush begins to sing; each glyph is a visible cost of pigment and stamina. The final ascent of the glyphs crystallizes the stake without resolving it tidily—an Earned Stasis that forecloses her sleepless quest. Agency is continuous; coincidence (janitor’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulation: kindness as a recoverable, transmissible language. Subtext lives in gesture—the half sandwich, the purring cats—never in moralizing. The final image of drifting saffron glyphs reweights the premise without a stated moral. Only a hairline slip: the janitor’s explicit articulation of theme edges toward Echo, but the resonance survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with saffron-tinted synesthesia and controlled rhythm. POV remains tight third-person; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices “bruised outlines of towers” and “liquid mercury” moonlight. Compression is purposeful; elisions (how glyphs ignite stars) are paid off by atmospheric shift. Dialogue minimal and subtextual—pigeon’s trill, janitor’s single line—both filtered through Mira’s understanding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, color, and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphorical coherence is maintained (“charcoal sketch someone tried to erase”). Rhythm modulates with fatigue and wonder. Occasional elevated diction (“manuscript of recovered grace”) stays within Mira’s painterly lexicon. Only a faint risk of purple in “daydreams sparked by moonlight,” but the pattern earns it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—insomniac painter revives lost kindness via lunar calligraphy—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (magical brush, city redemption) are transformed through saffron specificity and accumulative texture. Risk in lyric fabulation is balanced by grounded sensory stakes. Transformation test passes: swap Mira’s vocation or pigment and the emotional calculus collapses. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
