<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—cultivating distance yet yearning to connect—drives every micro-choice; the final dissolution is earned because her earlier estrangement tactic is visibly exhausted. Embodied emotion (flicker with the bulb) and the ledger’s blank “Begin” column crystallize cost. Only slight under-dramatized shift from operator to self-subject keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of wrong-number calls thickens until the glass loop reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara becomes “the interval between two notes”—with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; no causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tunnel’s single flickering bulb and the glass disc function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the final image of commuters hearing the four-note phrase from the rails recharges the entire atmosphere. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether estrangement can be reversed—tightens when Mara must apply her own method to herself. The disc’s loop escalates from background hum to structural force, forcing her recursive self-call. Cost is the literal shattering of her tool and her dispersal into wires.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of endings as disguised origins emerges organically from the ledger’s blank column and the final commuter refrain. No moralizing; the transformed melody offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior confession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under the switchboard sparks. Perceptual signature—“the tunnel had no exit on the schematic”—is unmistakably Mara’s. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Only a single mixed metaphor—“voice melodically haunted, like a lullaby remembering it had once been a scream”—momentarily muddies. Otherwise zero loops, high specificity, and cadence shifts match pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise of an underground operator who turns wrong-number grief into rebirth via a haunted glass disc is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky recursive self-call pays off without gimmickry; specificity anchors the surreal.</comment>
