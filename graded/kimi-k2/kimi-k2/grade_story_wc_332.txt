<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The librarian’s contradictory impulse—yearning to possess the dream yet gifting the palette—drives the final renunciation; the embodied cost (shadowless exile) is legible and scaled to the piece. Interiority remains concrete and character-specific, though a touch more micro-choice under pressure would lift it to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the palette’s transfer reweights the premise and forecloses pursuit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers absence until the final absence becomes lantern. Causality is lyric but coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago, palette, and jetty constrain every move; the palette’s sunrise charge directly shapes the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the librarian’s perceptual bias. Micro-setting (palette as compass) functions as setting and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—vitalizing the runaway dream—tightens once when the librarian chooses to relinquish rather than complete it. The cost (loss of palette and shadow) is visible and felt. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn-photography beat deepens the absence until the final gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “almost” and the ethics of possession emerges through action and image, never asserted. The luminous absence motif reweights at closure, transforming hollow into lantern. No moralizing; resonance is earned through the librarian’s costly renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (salt-ink, iron-lilac taste). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift; syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional pressure. Dialogue absent, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, no mixed metaphors. Occasional near-repetition (“hush of improbable beginnings”) is purposeful refrain, not artifact. High information density; every sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian myth, light-painting, and salt-map longing feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are inverted: the dream escapes not from neglect but from being fully seen. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
