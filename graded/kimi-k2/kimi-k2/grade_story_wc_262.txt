<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interior motive—“find where unused love is stored”—serves as constant engine; each micro-choice (threading the film, singing the lost tune, leaving the quartz) springs from that need, culminating in her renunciation of literal pursuit and acceptance of internalised tenderness felt on page. Embodied contradictions (trembling palms, cracked voice) manifest mid-action, never abstract. The cost of no longer following Lin is explicitly paid by walking away from the station a second time, now carrying the melody that had hunted her.</comment>

<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: every lyrical image—dusty reels, quartz glow, disembodied lyrics—adds density until the final cadence resolves stakes without causal plot reversals. Closure occurs as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s realisation that “love unused is love still” reweights every preceding object and silence. Cost is tangible in the film-flutter farewell and the decision to descend the stairs carrying irreversible lightness.</comment>

<comment>The projection booth is rendered with tactile specificity—hot carbon velvet, candy tin edges—and later refracted through Mara’s spatial imagination to yield the image of the theatre as anatomy. This micro-setting physically constrains access (narrow stairs, single window) and charges the climax when the beamless projector illuminates only through the crystal’s redirected light. Place becomes active vessel rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake is introduced in the first three sentences: locate the storage place of unused love. Each beat deepens that search: first as inventory deception, then as psychometric excavation, finally as recognition that love hides in the dark interval between frames. The tightening is subtle but legible—options narrow from external rescue to internal embodiment, and the price is paid by relinquishing reunion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges entirely from concrete particulars—celluloid ghosts, seat-row ribcage, the tune’s return—rather than authorial commentary. The story’s final image offers conceptual repricing: untouched love is not loss but latency, a resonance rather than an archive. This reconfiguration is experienced through Mara’s bodily reaction (melody in chest) instead of explained.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is sensual, eccentric, unerringly consistent—“a hushed thunder of reels turning above empty seats,” “psychometry… incubating the emulsion’s memories”—and remains anchored in Mara’s sensorium throughout. Syntax contracts under pressure (“Her voice cracked the booth’s stale equilibrium”) and exhales in lyrical release, teaching its pattern and delivering at closure without head-hopping.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Each sentence propels—sound, scent, memory, decision—achieving high information density without loops. Metaphors are startling yet coherent (“balcony as clavicle”) and never clog urgency. Final image crystallises earlier motifs (dust, quartz beam, song) into resonant single motion.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Takes familiar tropes (abandoned movie palace, lost love letter) and fuses them through psychometric practice seldom dramatized this viscerally. The crystalline re-embodiment of Lin as refracted lyrics is a fresh transformation that feels inevitable once the celluloid confesses its weather. Risk lies in sustained lyricism, but compression and closure preserve clarity.</comment>
