<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arlen’s interior contradiction—wanting to trap wonder yet remaining “peripherally focused”—is embodied in every micro-adjustment of dial and flame; the final renunciation (sealing wonder in the cellar while hearing its reverse-tick) carries a felt cost of exile from immediacy, earned by the preceding angle-by-angle surrender of lived echoes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reversed timer releases stored echoes into darkness, reconfiguring Arlen’s stance from hunter to archivist with visible forfeiture of wonder’s presence. Causal chain (angle → reflection → capture → cellar) holds without gaps; the marble cavern’s disorientation is taught early and pays off in mirrored infinity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marble veins, frost fingers, and duplicated candle-flames are not backdrop but instruments: the cavern’s reflective geometry dictates the 43°/31°/0° angles that drive every choice, and the final empty mirrors re-echo the loss. Sensory hierarchy is locksmith-precise, filtering wonder through tool and light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder before season’s lull ends—tightens with each dial click; the harvest of echoes narrows from boundless laughter to a single boxed note, the price being exile from spontaneous wonder. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of stored memories increases until the cellar’s silence becomes the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the violence of archiving wonder. The duke’s whisper and the girl’s laugh are not symbols but casualties filed in velvet. Final image of reverse-ticking cellar reframes earlier playfulness as preserved specimens—an earned, unsettling resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, and perceptually specific: “wings of memory” brushing beard, “moths of light” from coughing gears. Syntax mirrors locksmith precision—measured angles, soldered cracks—while lyric compression teaches its own pattern and pays it off in the cellar’s hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: every image doubles as action (reflections fold, frost creeps, sparks become moths). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent within physical logic. Final cadence slows to the soft reverse tick, earned by prior rhythmic acceleration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “preserve beauty” trope into a reverse-engineering of memory itself, using precise optical mechanics rather than sentiment. Risk lies in the abstract premise, but specificity of angles, brass ribs, and boxed echoes makes the concept inevitable and singular.</comment>
