<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fear of emptied dreams and her healing-by-witnessing both manifest in concrete micro-choices (aligning the telegram, naming the drowned). Corin’s grief is embodied in his trembling finger and unguarded smile, but his arc is slightly less textured. The final renunciation (offering guilt and fear) is earned and costly, though Corin’s offering feels briefly summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple dissolves, the telegram blanks, the seed pulses—cost is felt in the blank page and the lighter pocket. Causal chain holds: telegram → variable stars → shared naming → temple materializes → payment exacted. One clean transition from observatory to temple and back; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brass orrery, spectrograph lens, and daylily shadow are not mere scenery—they constrain action (aligning the petal with Betelgeuse) and charge the final image (seed inside blank telegram). Spatial choreography is tight; the observatory roof irising open is a tactile, lived move. Sensory selection narrows under urgency (scent of daylilies thick as ink).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the inscriptions by sharing burdens—is signaled early and tightened when the temple demands payment. Agency: Elara and Corin must name losses aloud, then surrender the heaviest. Cost is visible (blank telegram, seed in pocket). Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of shared sorrow emerges through specific particulars: each named loss becomes a fixed star. No moralizing; the temple’s rule (“enter by naming what you carry”) is dramatized, not stated. Final image of the blank telegram and pulsing seed reweights prior material without a thesis. Subtext in Corin’s first unguarded smile carries the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“stars jittered,” “thick as ink.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s: astronomical diction, dream-logic compression. No head-hopping; Corin’s interiority surfaces only through gesture and speech. Patterned elision (telegram’s ink rearranges off-stage) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“constellation of shared sorrow”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadence for wonder, clipped for revelation. Minor elevated diction (“chronicler,” “inscriptions”) fits Elara’s scholarly lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid-dream astronomy meets grief temple, anchored in brass orrery mechanics. Daylily telegram as living interface is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky celestial-astral transition lands because the brass pillars echo the orrery. No derivative echoes; the premise would collapse if names or places were swapped.</comment>
