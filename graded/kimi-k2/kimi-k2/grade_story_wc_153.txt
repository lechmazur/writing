<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—fierce tenderness vs. vanishing—are embodied in the shard’s dual role as weapon and balm; her micro-choices (cutting, kneeling, bleeding onto the blank letter) escalate under pressure. The final renunciation (“I choose to stay present”) is earned by the causal chain of embodied cost: blood, dissolution of letters, scarless sealing. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding therapy-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard dissolves, letters vanish, and Lira’s stance crystallizes with visible cost—her healed but once-bleeding palm. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density (letters, condensation, singing) until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint—moonlight healing only after dark—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are not backdrop but active pressure: roots form corridors, spirits condense messages, moonlight enables healing. Micro-setting (shard, cut palm, bark) constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—brine, humming, luminous bud—filtered through Lira’s bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the apology and face the cost—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened through each condensation message. One meaningful deepening: the blank letter forces Lira to pay blood for words, foreclosing avoidance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues. The felt price (scarless cut, dissolved letters) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of presence vs. vanishing emerges organically from the unsent letters and embodied ritual; no explicit moralizing. The final mirror image reweights earlier motifs (shard, moonlight, boy’s face) without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in gesture—blood on bark, shard crumbling—creating lingering ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect arises from concrete particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: rhythmic compression (“tasted their ink whenever she spoke of anything else”) teaches the pattern early. Perceptual signature is distinct—Lira’s synesthetic noticing of brine, humming, reversed script. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, culminating in the crystallized final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pattern-taught (“luminous bud,” “bridge of moonlight”). High information density without overwriting. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for approach, fragments for revelation. No artifacts in peak beats or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The unsent-letters ritual in a singing mangrove feels fresh, not a trope checklist. The shard’s evolution from weapon to dust is an inevitable yet non-obvious transformation. Specificity of condensation-script and moonlight healing anchors universals. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
