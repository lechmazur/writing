<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"fingertips still numb," "first sting of returning nerves"—and the bellhop’s contradictory impulses (remain vs. leave) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the bolt’s whisper and the staircase’s bleeding mark, with visible cost: the fortress collapses behind him. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Flawed passivity is credible and complicates the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change: the gate opens, the fortress falls, and the bellhop steps into memory-laden snow. Causal linkage holds—bolt → whisper → choice → gate → collapse—under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the fortress’s cracking walls and the single spoken word “Enough.” No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment (cobalt walls, snow, staircase discoloration) constrains every move and charges the final image when the fortress becomes “simply stone under stars.” Sensory selection is urgent—numb fingers, frost breath, salt-snow taste. Micro-setting (bolt, banister bruise) functions as setting that alters tactics. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain vs. leave—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the bolt’s whisper forces a trade-off between safety and memory. Cost is visible in the collapsing staircase and the swallowed screams. Agency drives the final turn; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. safety emerges from concrete events (bolt, gate, collapsing walls) without direct statement. Final image of snow falling upward reweights the premise with conceptual cost. No thematic echo or moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“color of winter dusk,” “bruised lavender,” “snow that tasted of salt and old songs.” POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“seraphically mundane,” “angel of ordinary metal.” Rhythm accelerates with pressure—“He lifted the bolt, felt the fortress shudder.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a fortress that devours memory, a bolt as key, snow falling upward. Tropes (haunted edifice, silent guardian) are transformed through specific sensory detail and conceptual reweighting. Risk-taking (lyric compression, surreal closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
