<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mortician’s contradictory impulse—clinging to the sparks of the dead while yearning for release—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing the chip, releasing it). The final renunciation carries visible cost: her empty palms and the map of faces etched in air. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no therapy-speak intrudes. The smile at the end is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the threshold collapses into a point of unbearable brilliance, reweighting every prior spark into a single beam. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the pattern of faces spirals, compresses, and is released. Orientation is anchored early by the lip of the skyborne grotto and the frost of breath. Cost is legible in the emptied grotto and the mortician’s unweighted palms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora, and glowing stone constrain the ritual; the emerald chip itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—frosted breath, starlit stone, green fire—filtered through the mortician’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is coherent: she steps, lifts, presses, releases. Weather and environment affect action; the aurora dims in respect, guiding choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the last sparks from oblivion—is signaled early and tightened once: surrender them all or lose them anyway. The mortician’s agency drives the escalation; her decision to infuse and release the emerald narrows options irreversibly. The cost is visible: the grotto empties, the aurora dims, her palms are empty. No coincidence resolves; the reversal is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the mortician’s vocation: beauty as defiance against oblivion. The final image—the map of faces etched in frost—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: the release of the chip, the unguarded smile. The ending reweights the premise; the salon she will open becomes a quiet perpetuation of the same defiance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure: “the radiant hush became a chord.” Perceptual signature is character-specific—patterns in static, geometries of grief. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Compression and elision are taught early (“she had no name for the place”) and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the mortician’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“green fire,” “map of frost”—without overwriting. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for memory, clipped release at climax. Grammar and pronouns are clean; spatial tracking precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of beautician-mortician, emerald chip, and threshold of stillness feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes are transformed: the afterlife is a skyborne salon, the mortician’s art becomes cosmic preservation. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reprise of the salon reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
