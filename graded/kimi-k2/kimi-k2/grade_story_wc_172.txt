<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—profit-driven drought vs. secret tenderness for the egg—are dramatized in every beat; her final renunciation costs her empire and is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and character-specific. The micro-choice to pour contraband water visibly forfeits her leverage, sealing the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drought she engineered is undone by her own hand, with undeniable social and financial cost. The inferred lens is Causal—because she nurtures the egg, therefore the river returns—and the pattern holds without contradiction. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or retroactive fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but active antagonist: its cracks form the map that guides her, its thirst swallows her water, its crystals cradle the egg. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The setting constrains every choice and charges the final image of the returning river.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control of water—tightens when her sentimental impulse forces the release that ends the drought. One meaningful turn: pouring the stolen water narrows her options to zero and triggers the river’s return. Cost is visible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of preserving beauty against utilitarian gain. The final image of the indigo-gold feather drifting beneath newborn water reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture and silence; no thematic echo is spoken aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm that accelerates under pressure. POV remains tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Lira’s plausible lexicon; perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and coherent; no mixed vehicles. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Zero line-level artifacts in the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—amoral philanthropist engineers drought to hoard water yet sacrifices empire to resurrect an extinct bird—feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details (salt-feather crystals, contraband river water) transform familiar eco-fantasy tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyrical ending pays off with resonant cost.</comment>
