<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reaper’s interior contradiction—wanting to forget yet compelled to remember—drives every beat; the crystallized names literally refill his hollow ribs, a visceral cost. His micro-choice to press the atlas to his chest seals the arc with earned stasis. Backstory is woven through present-tense cues (wax cylinder, prism shards) that tilt his stance without summary drift. The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper’s stance shifts from haunted to lantern-bearer, cost etched in the swallowed starlight of the names. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each crystallized syllable increases density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how the prism re-activates) is forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frost, broken dome, and brass gears are not backdrop but instruments: frost records absence, gears echo toothless time, prism fractures light into memory. Micro-setting (the atlas page) becomes the membrane that must be aligned and later folded into the coat—choice-constraining object-as-setting. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: brine and lullabies surface only when names awaken. Final horizon glow charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming the nameless to release the dead—tightens via each crystallized word that siphons light from the atlas. One meaningful deepening: the monsters dissolve into “mere outlines,” proving fear was smaller than love. Cost is visible in the atlas’s darkening and the cold starlight sinking into his ribs. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal turns, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion: beasts were sacrifices compressed by terror. Subtext hums in the lullaby-scented air and the woman-laughing wave—grief transmuted into guardianship. No moralizing; the final smile is earned, rueful, and ambiguous. Thematic resonance crystallizes in the reaper’s whispered “I name you, and in naming, I keep you,” a non-literal answer that reweights the entire atlas.</comment>

<comment>Voice is mythic yet tactile—“boots crunching frost that had never known a living footstep”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Compression (“echo of sacrifice trembled in the rafters”) teaches the pattern early; payoff in the final “lantern beneath the waves.” No head-hop; POV stays locked to the reaper’s perceptual signature. Diction is precise, never purple: “crystallized names pulsing like second heartbeats.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: every line advances image, memory, or stakes. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective—“constellations wheeled like slow clock hands”—and never clutters the climax. Syntax modulates from long breathless spirals to the stark final clause: “ready to speak the next forgotten phrase.” Zero artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise reframes sea monsters as compressed human sacrifice—fresh, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. The reaper’s task of naming fear is ancient yet rendered new through the atlas-prism mechanic. Risky lyric compression pays off: the ending’s “woman laughing” wave reconfigures grief into guardianship without sentimentality. No derivative echoes; the voice feels singular.</comment>
