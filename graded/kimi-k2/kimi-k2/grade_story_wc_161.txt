<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—preserving a lost music she can’t hear vs. rewriting her past—are dramatized in every micro-choice (sealing the skylight, forging papers, releasing the pigeon). The final renunciation of her violinist identity is earned by the prior cascade of lies and the returned feather’s promise. Monsieur Vidal’s quiet complicity supplies relational pressure without stealing focus. Interiority is embodied (dust on eyelashes, trembling paper) rather than labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned pigeon minus the meteorite but plus a new feather crystallizes “trust begins where the song ends.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rewritten document and dust-mote pattern layers density until the final swirl reweights everything. Causality is intact: the boy’s letter forces the climactic release. No orientation debt; attic, skylight, and stakes are anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The attic’s brass cages, cracked encyclopedias, and dust motes under the skylight are not backdrop but instruments: the cages trap and release, the motes map lies, the cracked spines echo broken histories. The micro-setting constrains every choice—balancing on atlases, feeding papers to the stove—charging the final image of shadows dissolving into swirl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether Liora can bear the cost of her own lies—tightens when the letter arrives and the meteorite is sent. One decisive deepening: the pigeon’s return without the chip but with a feather forces her to abandon the paper trails. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust as the antithesis of curated history emerges through concrete particulars: forged programs burned, dust motes that remember, a child’s drawing that refuses erasure. The final image of ash spirals indistinguishable from dust offers a non-literal answer—truth is what survives revision. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the empty cages that slowly refill.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“dust motes could swirl like notes above the rafters”). Perceptual signature is Liora’s synesthetic mapping of dust into music and history. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden; Monsieur Vidal’s “I know” carries entire histories.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers texture without clutter. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“feathers snowed down among the dust”). No loops or scaffold; information is multiplexed. Minor elevation in register (“blooming withering light”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of pigeon trainer, meteorite compass, and forged violinist history feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test: swap any element and the emotional calculus collapses. Risky lyric structure holds under pressure, culminating in the earned stasis of emptied cages that slowly refill.</comment>
