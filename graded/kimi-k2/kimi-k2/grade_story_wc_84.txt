<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to slot the chip into the drone’s “injured bird” heart crystallizes her arc. The pilgrim’s silent pressure and branded wrist create a credible crucible without head-hopping. Only the pilgrim’s vanishing feels slightly convenient, trimming the top edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—star-charts, gears, matrix chip—and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “WE ARE THE MISSING PIECES OF EACH OTHER” reweights the entire pattern. Orientation is anchored by dusk, copper domes, and crunching boots within 120 words. No causality breaks; the pilgrim’s exit is earned by prior pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s “brilliant dimness” and dismantled orrery constrain every move; the meridian line literally guides the chip’s placement. Sensory selection is urgent—metal taste, rotor whispers—filtered through Lira’s pilot gaze. The micro-setting of the drone’s exposed heart functions as a second, mobile environment that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in the pilgrim’s first line and tightened when Lira risks burning her fingers. The final star-wink and open-parenthesis glyph force a trade-off: she completes the bracket, accepting perpetual itinerancy. Cost is felt but not yet paid, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative leaving of pieces; no character states it outright. The drone’s projection reconfigures the premise: belonging is a rhythm, not a location. Final resonance—“how complete a missing piece could feel”—is earned, unsentimental, and lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “shadows pooled like ink,” “gears gaping like mouths missing teeth.” Compression is taught early and paid off in the final glyph. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s dusk-soft diction contrasts cleanly with Lira’s tactile pilot idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense: each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Twilight solder the edges together” is exact and gorgeous. Rhythm accelerates with rotor whispers and slows for the final silence—flawless line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of type-foundry matrix, drone dream-logic, and pilgrim relay system feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk-taking—non-linear star trails as navigation, parenthesis glyph as closure—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No recognizable template; the story owns its mythic tech-pilgrim hybrid.</comment>
