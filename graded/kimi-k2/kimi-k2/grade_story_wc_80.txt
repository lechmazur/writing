<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her fingertip tracing “grief pressed into mortar” shows stoic sensitivity in action. Motivation (archeologist of absence) is dramatized through micro-choices: dropping ink, measuring hollows, writing notes. The final whispered promise earns a resonant cost, though the heartbeat-in-the-wall moment edges toward convenient epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ink-drop and measured absence layers density until the inkwell’s new map reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pavilion’s sigh and the ink’s refracted floor-plan crystallize options without tidy resolution. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is not backdrop but active constraint: moonlit cracks guide Elara’s notes, fish-scale commas mirror lost syllables, and the rising drawbridge enforces the scene’s ticking clock. Final image of the lantern-lit absence could not exist without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recording absence before water returns—tightens via each measured hollow and the ink’s finite drops. One decisive intensification: the inkwell absorbs absences and redraws the pavilion, foreclosing further mapping. Cost is felt in the weight of the inkwell and the dawn deadline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from Elara’s acts; no moralizing. The chandelier’s ghost and the silt-sigh reconfigure meaning without statement. Final slip—“May the next dream find courage”—earns resonance through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “hushed blaze of silence,” “amphibious heartbeat.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices negative space, smells cedar in ink, hears chains as thunder. No head-hopping; compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors (“ivy through a ribcage”) are precise and earned. Minor drift—“reluctant tears” skirts cliché—but no loops or scaffold in peak beats. Final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—mapping drowned dreams with living ink—is fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of ruin-exploration and ghostly architecture are transformed through Elara’s cartographic grief. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
