<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—cartographic control vs. emotional surrender—are embodied in every beat; the scar, the backward-facing seat, the final inward-pointing arrows all dramatize her renunciation of mapping others and acceptance of mapping herself. The cost is visible when the fortress folds into the punch and the cracks heal, foreclosing her old habit. Interiority stays specific and sensory, avoiding therapy-speak. Only the mother’s translucent appearance edges toward convenient spectral exposition, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mother’s confession dissolves into stardust that re-weights Elara’s compulsion, turning the arrow outward-in. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each station’s silhouette layers regret until the spiral staircase erases habits one step at a time. Causality is tight: the phantom punch’s bite causes the scar, the scar causes the gate to open, the confession causes the inward arrows. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The starlit mist, glowing pavement cracks, and moonlight-stitched train are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze. Micro-settings—seat fabric matching her birthmark, staircase stone matching the grave marker—constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: the fortress’s “silence shaped like a building” is felt more than seen. Only the watercolor-smear towns risk decorative excess, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the unspoken sentence—tightens when each station deposits a regret-silhouette, raising the cost of continuing. The spiral staircase physically erases bad habits, a visible price that narrows options. Agency remains Elara’s: she presses the punch, ascends, accepts the confession. No coincidence resolves; the train vanishes only after the inward turn is complete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: maps as self-portraits, wounds as compass. The final reconfiguration—“hurt is also the compass”—is never stated but enacted when stardust arrows point inward. Subtext thrives in silence: the mother’s confession is a moth in glass until touched. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the healed-yet-curved final crack.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively Elara’s—analytically artistic, synesthetic, compressed yet lyrical. Syntax mirrors her mind: long, layered clauses when charting, fragment bursts under pressure (“She walked.”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked. The punch’s ticking “second heart” and the seat’s constellation fabric are perceptual signatures, not decorative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“ghosts of every wrong turn,” “stations named after apologies”). Rhythm modulates with stakes—short beats on the staircase, lingering cadence in the confession chamber. No loops or mixed metaphors; even “watercolor smears” fits the painterly POV. One minor scaffold: “analytically artistic” appears twice in close proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The phantom-train-as-memory-vehicle feels inevitable yet fresh; the route-mapper who maps only her own wounds is a non-obvious synthesis. Tropes—midnight train, spectral parent—are transformed through Elara’s cartographic lens. Risky lyric compression pays off: the fortress as “silence shaped like a building” crystallizes stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
