<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nadia's emotional interiority—"wreckage of her own mind," "salt-stiff hair"—is embodied and specific, yet her contradictory impulses (cling vs release) are only implied. Her micro-choice—breathing on the globe—catalyzes a cascade, but the leap from salvaging a childhood desire to ghost-collector ethics feels lightly driven by prior material. Backstory/Reflection stays within the 20 % cap and lands via the final rescue; still, her flaw (obsessive collection) is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens dominates; pressure is built via layered dream-snippets rather than causal chains. Closure arrives via Conceptual Repricing (CR): locket seals the "rescued snow" and forecloses collection, reweighting salvage as release of secrets. A minor temporal leap—from globe to memory to shrine—doesn’t undermine orientation because the glacier/shrine frame is continuously anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glacier, shrine, candleflames, and narwhal-tooth locket are all vivid and specific; micro-objects (globe, locket) constrain final action and charge the ending. No contradiction, and the cold/heat polarity feeds internal tension. Meets the micro-setting gate for 9+ but lacks a constraining environmental obstacle beyond temperature memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—purify memory by emptying the wreck’s ghosts—is signaled early and tested by each dream-cameo. Escalation comes as each artifact unearths a deeper second of loss, until the "perfect sphere" forms and locket closes, deepening cost. Final payoff: release of the radioman shows a visible price, though the act itself relies on metaphor rather than scene resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of salvage as relinquishment emerges organically from images (melted globe yielding pure snow, radioman's release). No overt sermon; final image of “snow that never stops falling” reconfigures value without naming it. The ambiguity around purity vs memory hoarding feels earned. A slight risk of ethereal abstraction stays within the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct neoprene-and-brittle-star diction remains consistent and voice-bound; the clipped “14:07 nostrils fill, 14:08 hull buckles” functions as textured list-rhythm. Purposeful uncertainty (“dream of reaching into a whale’s heart”) taught early and paid by ghost-release. A single possible POV shimmer (radioman’s kiss) is handled as metaphoric rather than psychic leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies from long breath-sentence to staccato timestamps of death. Dense metaphor (“auroras… like borrowed starlight crackling”) occasionally overlays: not purple on first read, but second pass picks up minor figurative echo chains. No redundant loops or scaffold. Information multiplexing keeps every line propulsive; clarity never taxed at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fuses “ghost-as-cameo in strangers’ dreams” with “wreck-diver mystic” in a synthesis that feels specific rather than gimmick—the cameos grow literal and constrain later action. The transformation test: cannot swap names, place, or objects without breaking dream-collection logic. Risky lyric mode pays off in the final whale-heart release, earning +0.2 within band.</comment>
