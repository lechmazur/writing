<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s contradictory impulses—smuggler’s bravado vs. caretaker of fragile language—are embodied in micro-choices (tongue-hiding seed, pitcher-plant flick) and culminate in the earned cost of grafting his spark outward. Interiority is vivid, but the “candidly cryptic” label is slightly external; still, the final renunciation of safety feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the warp completes, gardens exhale defiance, and Lysander’s spark grafts outward with visible social cost. Causal chain (seed → beetle → scent → citywide pattern) holds; the greenhouse beats anchor orientation early. One minor ellipsis—how auditors miss the scent—doesn’t break legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s humid air, pitcher-plant acid, and beetle clicks constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (leaf-vein hiding spots, loamy pot) functions as tool; sensory hierarchy reflects Lysander’s smuggler priorities. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unlicensed language—tightens when mimic auditors land; Lysander’s agency drives each beat (planting seed, flicking mimic, checking glyphs). Cost is felt: spark may burn the hand. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic resistance emerges through concrete particulars: taxed metaphors, beetle pheromones, chlorophyll graffiti. Final image reweights premise without moralizing—defiance becomes airborne fragrance. Subtext in “grow so loud they can’t hear the tax” carries double edge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating from rogue charm to reverent caretaker. Distinct perceptual signature—“fountain-pen nib” legs, “redacted footnote” scent—anchors POV. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“captive cicadas” sets lyric pattern) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere (root shaped like question mark → exclamation). Minor elevated diction (“obsolete taxonomies”) fits scholar POV. Rhythm accelerates with warp completion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—taxable thoughts, insect couriers, living cipher—synthesizes familiar dystopia with fresh biological linguistics. Transformation test: story collapses without beetle dialects and gourd seed. Risk in lyric density pays off; no close echoes.</comment>
