<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is rich—her “perceptively calm gaze” and tactile ritual with the child’s photograph embody motive—but the arrival of secondary characters dilutes her agency; the final renunciation (emptying the case) is earned yet shared with the collective, softening individual cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral of photographs becomes a living manuscript, cost felt in the empty case and the archivist’s departure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added image increases density until the field itself transmutes pain. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lavender rows and rusted factory interweave with action—soil warmth, iron scent, vines blooming atop the smokestack—charging the final image. The setting constrains placement of arcs and mirrors the spiral, making environment an active participant in healing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute pain into masterpiece—tightens as each photograph narrows the spiral toward center. Collective arrival escalates texture rather than conflict; cost is diffuse but legible in the archivist’s relinquishment of her collected memories to the soil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges through image and scent, never sermon. The spiral’s transformation from grief to luminescence offers a non-literal answer; final laughter-through-tears embodies complexity without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“green fingers curling like signatures,” “lullaby sung by ghosts”—sustains perceptual signature under pressure. POV remains anchored; no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision (e.g., “silver and scent”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or emotion. Rhythm modulates with scene needs, climaxing in the final spiral image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of memory-archive-as-healing-ritual feels fresh; transformation of abandoned factory and photographs into living symphony is specific and inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
