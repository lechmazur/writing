<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—she both clings to and doubts the borrowed astronomer persona; embodied micro-choices (locking reversed type, pressing halo to heart) reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation to “solve emotion” is dramatized through tactile risk, not label. Final renunciation of borrowed identity carries visible cost: halo cracks, workshop dissolves, leaving unborrowed uncertainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “To measure emotion, first become the distance it travels” reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of star-loss and ink-dark sheets tightens until the final blank sheet darkens with reader’s future sadness. Causality intact: each beat (inking, printing, reversing) follows because/therefore logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz roof, copper glow, and ink stone anchor early; micro-setting of chase and halo constrain final reversal. Sensory hierarchy narrows to pulse-cold glass and starless hum, mirroring internal erasure. Environment evolves: walls thin into transparency, floorboards pace—setting actively pressures the choice to reverse the press.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy be transposed without hollowing selves—signaled in first paragraph. Escalation via accelerating star-loss tightens denominator toward zero, forcing reversal. One decisive tightening: she chooses to run press backward, paying with cracked halo and dissolved workshop. Cost is visceral and conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: regret distilled into 12-point Garamond, then returned. Final theorem is earned image, not statement. Ambiguity (“I was never here” vs “stay”) reweights premise without moralizing. Resonance lingers in cracked glass bead—ordinary object now maps where understanding begins.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyric, yet precise: “tear turned inside out,” “captive weather.” Perceptual signature filters everything through letterpress lexicon (chase, broadside, Garamond). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical lines collapse into “She stepped outside.” No head-hopping; POV remains locked to operator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “stars blinked out in sequence” compresses cosmic and emotional scale. Syntax accelerates under stress—fragments mirror disorientation. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—emotion as measurable vector distilled into letterpress ink—is fresh synthesis of grief and typography. Risky reversal of press pays off: blank sheet darkens with reader’s future sadness, a conceptual twist that feels inevitable. Specificity of 12-point Garamond and halo petal anchors universals. No close echoes.</comment>
