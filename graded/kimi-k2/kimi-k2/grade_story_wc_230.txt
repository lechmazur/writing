<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—her involuntary honesty vs her self-protective skepticism—is alive in every micro-choice; the glass-eye surrender embodies the earned cost of accepting stewardship, renouncing isolation after line “roots tightened around the glass.” Minor flaw: Dr. Kestrel’s motives remain slightly under-examined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands in the soil: a reconfiguration—truths become voluntary lullabies, orchard and narrator stabilize in one motion—felt cost on page. Causal links hold (eye planted → compulsion eased → roots anchor cliff) without reversals to exceed word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ravine geography, pendulous boughs, flood-scoured gullies and storm scents constrain every move; the orchard itself is final anchor that makes the closing sway meaningful. Sensory economy is high, no clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single escalating pressure: storm approaching → fear will collapse orchard → plant eye → risk of exposure. Final beat locks down options and displays felt price. Storm does not save them; their own act does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of confession as structural timber emerges organically: “the orchard will mistake your honesty for stability.” Final image of singing trees reframes earlier fear without preaching. Nuanced, unsentimental grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lira’s voice owns every sentence—skepticism, tactile precision, lyric compression under pressure: “black diamonds of the earth,” “hush like snowfall inside my skull.” POV never wavers; prose modulates with storm’s crescendo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density per sentence yet clean, e.g. “leaves lifted, catching rain like chalices.” Figurative layering controlled under word-limit; one mixed metaphor risk (“shattered mirror still reflects”) but it serves thematic fracture, not artifact.</comment>

<comment>Post-empathy-virus world, relic-smuggling orchard, glass-eye-as-guardian: synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Stakes intimate yet singular; nothing swapped in for generic placeholders.</comment>
