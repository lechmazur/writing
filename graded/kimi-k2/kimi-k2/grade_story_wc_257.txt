<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The maker’s grief is embodied in sustained sensory detail—beads weighting pockets, scent of damp earth, locket she “cannot finish.” The single on-page beat where she kneels and threads jet beads as mulch crystallizes irreversible renunciation: mourning gear re-purposed into garden feed with visible, felt cost. Internal contradiction—still love versus necessity of letting go—remains active until caretaker’s final line. No major slips, yet emotional beats occasionally drift toward poetic summary rather than concrete gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: the unfinished locket planted as seed is a decisive image carried through micro-beats. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—crane coordinates and garden overlays accumulate until meaning re-shifts under starlight; the cost is felt in the instant locket vanishes into soil. No orientation drift, timeline stable. Slight compression on caretaker’s final speech but effect lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory dome, brass caretaker, origami sills, and garden overlay function as micro-setting: physical telescope tripod becomes living trellis, marble floor smells of damp earth. These items constrain choices—only the dome stays open, only marble accepts planted seeds—final bloom image directly charged by the setting’s transformation. Sensory specificity is layered and unobtrusive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—will she teach the garden to bloom or stay locked in grief—signals early and tightens through each crane fold and seed string. Agency steadily forecloses the path of finishing the mourning locket; final planting is earned renunciation. Cost (locket forfeiture) is dramatized, pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens without external luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of grief as fertile cultivation emerges organically from image sequence—jet beads as compost, locket as root—rather than explicit statement, save for single final line that is earned by concrete acts. Subtext thrives in silent exchanges and object weight, final image non-literal yet conceptually priced. No sentimentality because imagery is specific and embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical density suffuses the POV—maker’s noticing filtered through tactile details of brass wings and garden scents—while compressions remain legible under Accumulative lens. Rhythmic control under stress—“taste like first rain”—never breaks causality. Dialogue minimal but purposeful subtext when caretaker speaks once. Register stays consistent; poetic syntax feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose exhibits high information density, zero paraphrase loops, vivid diction (“root and stem at once”). Figurative layering dense but purposeful, no metaphors contradict established physical logic. Momentum propulsive without scaffolding. Minor moments of elevated lyric diction occasionally flirt with ornamental excess yet never stall the beat or cloud the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Mourning-gift-garden graft is fresh synthesis; AI astrolabe caretaker with soft wings feels inevitable in hindsight, never gimmick. Transformations—jet beads as mulch, origami seeds as star maps—are singular, not templated. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in resonant reconfiguration without causality loss.</question>
