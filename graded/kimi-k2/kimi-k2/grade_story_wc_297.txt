<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. memory-loss—are dramatized in the seed-offering beat; the cost (surrendered dreams) is embodied in the wrist-scar reconfiguration. Interiority is specific, but “anxious elation” recurs as label-speak, blunting peak emotion. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra becomes the new covenant, scars rearranged, mirrors adjusting—felt cost is the memories braided into the seed. Causal lens holds: each beat (scar signal → clipping planted → memories traded → mirrors shift) links by “because/therefore.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s mirrored grass and glass-stalks constrain movement and reflect memory; the miniature maze at the center literally shapes Lyra’s shrinking path. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Final image—moonlit pollen—recharges the glade’s equilibrium, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore balanced light—tightens when Lyra must choose which memories to surrender; the seed’s demand narrows options. Escalation is causal: each memory offered intensifies the maze’s glow and the mirrors’ tremble. Cost is visible on her wrist and in the reclaimed dusk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “abandoned futures” emerges through the seed that folds premature timelines; no direct statement, only image and action. Final whispered vow reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the scar-sigil and pollen-dissolution lingers with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters world through Lyra’s root-bound lexicon (“root-bound archives,” “glass-grass”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during seed-offering, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned early (“cobalt glade shimmered like a bruise”) and paid off. Minor loop: “anxious elation” repeats three times, a small drag. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—orbital mirrors stealing tomorrow’s light—feels fresh; the living maze as covenant contract is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression taught early and held. Transformation test fails if names change, confirming originality.</comment>
