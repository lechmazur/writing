<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the “blushing stillness” and the tactile knotting of thread—yet her contradictory impulses (need to commemorate vs. acceptance of forgetting) remain slightly under-dramatized; the final renunciation is earned but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral, keeping her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice becomes an invitation rather than a monument, and the slackening red thread marks the grotto’s acceptance and forgetting. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added layer of thread, wing, and shadow deepens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s transient soil and breathing vines physically constrain Lira’s tactics—she must build light, temporary, biodegradable signals—and the moth wing’s magnified shadow literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is disciplined, altitude-cold and orchid-indigo filtering through her precise, esoteric gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether a fragile amen can answer an interrupted cadence—tightens once when the tower’s knot loosens and the thread goes slack; the cost is the grotto’s inevitable forgetting. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more cadence-shift than causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: overlooked histories persist as folded micro-archives, not monuments. The final projection of the erased city’s shadow offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting every prior knot and scale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet crystal-clear; patterned elision (“blushing stillness,” “ghost generations”) is taught early and paid off in the final shimmer. Syntax mirrors the character’s esoteric precision—no head-hop, no register drift, and perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image performs double duty (orchids like chandeliers, moth wing as map). No loops, no mixed metaphors, and the closing cadence of slack thread and starlit shimmer lands without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—monarch migration as micro-archive, semaphore lattice as elegy—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the erased-city shadow is a fresh inflection that could not be transplanted to another setting unchanged.</comment>
