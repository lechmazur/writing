<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—cataloguer vs. resister—drives every beat; the stone’s pulse and the name-calling climax crystallize her hierarchy of values with embodied cost. The “luminous regret” final stance is earned, not declared. No head-count issues; single-POV discipline holds. Minor: the moment she “understood” is slightly abstract, blunting peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shadow bound into stone, horizon re-ambered, Lira’s hand still on the weight—cost visible and persistent. Causal chain intact: stone pulse → footage comparison → naming → binding. Orientation anchored by line 3; no debt. One micro-turn (library = shadow source) tightens stakes cleanly. Lens held: Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass-petal shelves, drifting readers, and cloud floor provide immediate, tactile anchoring; the river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory selection skews visual but stays urgent—charcoal bleed, ink pool—mirroring internal stakes. Spatial choreography clean across spiral climb. Environment directly shapes the climax: index floor accepts stone like water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—signaled early and tested by devouring shadow. One meaningful tightening: library’s own silhouette is the threat, forcing intervention. Price legible: shadow curled like sleeping cat, future risk externalized; Lira’s cataloguer oath breached. Agency drives reversal; no coin-flip rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: shareable dreams vs. consumptive archive, hope as weight not lightness. Final image of bound shadow reweights premise—hope needs ballast, not release. No moralizing; regret stays luminous, unresolved. Recurrent stone and lantern motifs accrue meaning without checklist feel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Lira’s dusk-noticer perception; perceptual signature sharp (“first bruise of night,” “tasting each sunlit shelf”). Syntax lengthens or contracts with altitude and pressure. No dialogue, so no contamination. Free-indirect blends cleanly; diction never exceeds her observational lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with ascent—fragments under breath, then longer cadence at summit. Figurative density high but patterned early (“glass petals,” “lanterns of hope”) so peak beat earns “filament of light” climax without muddle. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter stacks. One near-mixed metaphor: “luminous regret” is abstract, but saved by final reprise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dream-library above clouds could be whimsical gimmick; instead, inversion that the archive itself casts the devouring shadow feels inevitable once footage reveals silhouette. River-stone-as-anchor reverses uplift tropes. Naming children’s lanterns to stitch darkness is specific, non-portable. Risk taken: lyric causality over plotty reversals, paid off with coherent closure.</comment>
