<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the archivist’s contradictory impulses—grief, duty, longing—co-exist in real time. The final choice to stay and dissolve is earned by the mother’s precedent and the locket’s reweighting. Micro-choices (pressing the petal, capping the pen) reveal value hierarchy. Only the slight abstraction “haunted euphoria” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist becomes annotation, the covenant preserved in pigment and heartbeat. Causal chain—mother’s step, daughter’s repetition—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the locket’s mirror and her thinning body. No orientation drift; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, walnut vials, and locket function as micro-settings that constrain every move. Sensory selection (brine-roses, ink warmth) is filtered through professional urgency. Final image of the ordinary yet rose-tasting jetty recharges the whole. One notch down only because the broader village remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory or drown—tightens once when the jetty dissolves and she chooses annotation. Escalation is a single, decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; cost is the self’s erasure. No reversals needed; the covenant’s whisper suffices as pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden emerges through concrete particulars: petal on photo, ink drinking image, locket mirror. No moralizing; final smile is haunted, euphoric, complete—an earned non-verbal answer. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under dissolution. Perceptual signature—“walnut time,” “impossible bloom”—is consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final annotation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, texture, and consequence. Occasional elevated diction (“metaphysics,” “annotation”) is voice-motivated. No loops or mixed metaphors; final line is crystalline. One stray “haunted euphoria” label is the only blemish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise of cyclical floral covenant is fresh; execution grounds it in tactile process (steeping ink, pressing petal). Transformation test fails if names change—details are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric dissolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
