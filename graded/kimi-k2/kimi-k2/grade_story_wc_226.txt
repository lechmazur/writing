<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lysandra’s drive is clear and embodied in her choices—e.g., “pressed her charcoal-stained fingers against the pale spire”—but interior tension is stated rather than dramatized (“understood now the price of forgiveness”). The final refrain feels earned yet the moment of internal contradiction remains generalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure takes the form of an earned re-instrumentalization of the towers, reweighting their meaning from judgment to prism; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. The cost is perceptible—“the pale spire cracked”—but the transition is slightly smoothed rather than sharply staked, reducing final punch.</comment>

<comment>The canyon, bone towers and refracted light are vivid and continually constrain options—access paths, acoustic loops, optic properties. The towers function as both setting and tool, directly enabling the climatic refract. Sensory anchors are present by line 3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—liberate forgiveness from the Council’s monopoly—is signaled early and tightened as the ritual clock approaches. Escalation is textural: each poem adds chromatic density and social risk until collective defiance crystallizes. One meaningful intensification is cleanly delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars rather than meta-statement; the towers’ literal transformation into prisms of reclaimed story embodies the thesis. Final resonance—“let every flawed moment stand in the light”—is felt through visible spectacle without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, rhythmic control with purposeful compression (“her heart heavier with the weight”). Interior focalization remains consistent and urgent under pressure; the poetic diction never drifts into explanatory over-articulation.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose propels and compresses—most sentences advance tone or plot. Minor over-figuration occurs—“forged hush before the ritual”—yet clarity never falters near closure. One looped stem “refract… refracted” appears but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bone-tower prism, refracted confessions, and ritual-clock coup are an original synthesis; no wholesale template matches this exact conceit. Inventive use of physics-as-metaphor keeps the concept grounded in on-page action.</comment>
