<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—logic versus wonder—drives every beat; the stamp in her palm crystallizes her choice to abandon certainty. Embodied emotion (“reclaimed stillness settle on her shoulders like silt”) anchors her arc. Final renunciation of digital verdicts costs her institutional authority and is earned by prior tactile discoveries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the stamp pressed into clay reweights the library from “refuge” to “ark of pre-language memory.” Causal chain—blackout → manual test → vault breach → new catalogue—holds without gaps. Cost is the surrender of sanctioned history.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled to tools and architecture: the lantern flame elongates, bronze doors yield, clay tablets speak. Each detail constrains tactics (dead seals, water level) and charges the final image of dawn through fathoms. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth of the library’s origin—tightens when the blackout forces analogue inquiry. One decisive deepening: the stamp’s magnetic turn reveals a third timeline, collapsing the binary histories. Agency remains Lira’s throughout; cost is the loss of institutional certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus sanctioned narrative emerges through tactile objects, never exposition. Final image of dawn reframes “dappled resolve” as emergent truth rather than imposed verdict. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and lightly archaic (“pre-ink, pre-paper”) without slipping into pastiche. Syntax mirrors Lira’s indexing mind—catalogue-like clauses that tighten under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to her perceptual filter.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective (“lantern flame elongated, as though the stamp drew light the way tide draws moon”) and never stalls momentum. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during vault breach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sunken-city fantasy with epistemological mystery; the library as pre-lapsarian memory chamber feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky compression—wax tablets, magnetic stamp, blackout—pays off in a single crystallized gesture. No derivative echoes.</comment>
