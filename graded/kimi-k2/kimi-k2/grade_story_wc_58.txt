<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"tasted explained absences in it"—but the final renunciation feels slightly under-motivated; the thread’s warmth is vivid yet the cost of letting go is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s hush and the glowing thread reconfigure the traveler’s stance with felt cost—“the part of herself that had waited on every dock.” Accumulative lens holds; each lantern-word tightens the pattern toward the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shadowed garden, cracked marble, late quince scent—details are selective and bias-filtered; the thread against pale stone in the final image constrains the promise and charges memory with tangible weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping absence to heal—tightens through each written lantern; the final line redraws the coastline, foreclosing endless waiting. Cost is visible in the traveler’s stiff knees and emptied hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-country emerges through concrete particulars; the final non-literal prayer—“coastline we redraw together”—reweights prior images without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with perceptual signature—“leaves looked like a small, deliberate obituary”—and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language serves pattern—lantern-words, moth-face—without clutter. One minor loop: “presence can be projected beyond the body’s jurisdiction” slightly restates prior beat, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief ritual transformed through inkless writing and thread-magic; synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking (writing on air) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
