<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulses—truth-seeker vs. protector of fragile peace—are embodied in the moment she folds the compass into the Apple and replants it. The interiority is specific, never diagnostic; her heartbeat registering with the orchard is a lived, bodily cost. The final renunciation is earned: her father’s letter predicts her arrival, so silence is both betrayal and mercy. Only the courier’s death feels slightly external, not fully filtered through her stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: replanting the Apple reframes the entire orchard from lie to living archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each torn strip, each pulse of quartz, thickens the pattern until the final image reweights history itself. Cost is legible in the “sharper gaze” she carries away and the orchard’s “eventual harvest,” a deferred reckoning. No causality breaks; every object and rumor pays into the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard is no backdrop; its radioactive dust, hybrid trunks, and quartz stillpoint actively shape tactics—she reassembles letters beneath translucent quartz because the place widens time. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: iodine-cinnamon wind, flawed glass fruit, Geiger-silent dawn. The setting constrains the final act: only here can the Apple become a tree of memory. Micro-detail (saddle-leather satchel, paper compass) grounds the speculative frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. further graves—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when her father’s letter names her as the experiment’s trigger. One decisive deepening: the Apple is not cursed but engineered, forcing a choice between broadcast and burial. Agency is hers alone; coincidence (courier’s death) complicates but does not resolve. The cost is felt in her empty pockets and the orchard’s silent compass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as justice and memory as weapon, never stated outright. The orchard’s fruit literalizes buried history; the paper compass becomes a fuse that chooses slow growth over explosive revelation. Final image—dust drifting east while the orchard “quietly compassed itself”—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext in shredded letters and mineral data keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, irradiated, precise: “sky spat grey radioactive dust,” “genetic spilled from mass graves.” Perceptual signature is Lina’s—scientific detachment laced with inherited guilt. Syntax tightens under pressure: long sentences for discovery, fragments at the stillpoint. No head-hopping; every perception is filtered through her dosimeter and her father’s handwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no purple stacks. Rhythm modulates with stakes: measured cataloguing of shredded strips, then clipped cadence at the replanting. Zero loops or scaffold; “stillpoint,” “compass,” and “harvest” recur only when they reweight meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—memory-bearing fruit grown from mass graves—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Familiar tropes (post-apocalyptic orchard, cursed object) are transformed through genetic-quartz specificity and the father-daughter experiment. Risky choice to end on renunciation rather than exposure pays off: the orchard becomes a living archive, not a revelation device. No derivative echoes; the voice and world cohere as singular.</comment>
