<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marisol’s involuntary truth-telling trait is dramatized early and shapes her final, costly admission; her embodied climb and the warm coin in her hand give tactile cost. Interiority stays specific to her, though the “wonder” epiphany edges toward label-speak. The earned stasis—accepting that the tower’s song has changed key—feels proportionate to the 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s hum shifts from mechanical to bioluminescent, reweighting the blackout from failure to cocoon. Causal chain—riddle → match → filament reveal → bee rebirth—holds without gaps; cost is the emptied matchbox and the irreversible change in the tower’s nature. Orientation is anchored by lantern, dusk, and toll stool within 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lightning tower, nectar dusk, and burnt-ozone air are vivid and selective; the copper sculptures and lacquer box act as micro-settings that constrain her climb and the final placement. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent; the tower’s height and spiral stairs guide her ascent and descent without drift. The setting’s transformation into glowing bees charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid systemic collapse—is signaled early and tightened when Marisol must decide whether to trust the riddle’s promise. One clear escalation: the match strike awakens the tower, foreclosing the option of permanent blackout. Cost is legible in the irreversible metamorphosis of the bees and her acceptance of a new, uncertain song.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of failure and transformation; “wonder” is not asserted but demonstrated through the bees’ rebirth. Subtext resides in the lacquer box’s sealed click and the warm coin—small, wordless proofs of value. The final whispered riddle-answer offers a resonant, non-moralizing reweighting of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Marisol’s toll-keeper diction; sensory filters (“nectar dusk,” “burnt ozone”) feel specific to her. Syntax modulates with ascent—longer clauses for climb, clipped fragments for wonder. No head-hopping; POV distance stays intimate. Patterned repetition (“wonder, always wonder”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“bioluminescence of reborn bees”) is earned by context. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of blackout, bee-hive failure, and involuntary truth-telling yields a fresh mythic tone. The riddle’s answer—“wonder”—reverses the expected tech-restoration plot. Specificity of toll coins and lacquer box prevents generic feel. Risky lyric compression succeeds; closure remains legible and charged.</comment>
