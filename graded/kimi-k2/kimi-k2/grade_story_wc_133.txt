<question>1</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ishka’s exhaustion, paint ritual, and the mother-backstory brooch all serve her charged micro-choice—handing over the heirloom. One slip: the stranger’s “hungry eyes” and star voice edge toward stylized archetype rather than specific interior, damping full individuation, but the final beat still feels earned by prior yearning. Minor deduction capped at −0.3.</comment>

<comment>Closure folds “now and then” into the folded canvas—an unforced Resonant Reconfiguration where surrender re-weights both past and future with a felt cost. Each beat follows under Accumulative/Textural lens: tide rises, brooch passes, future seeps into present without causal leaps. No teleporting props or timeline drift; orientation held.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Battered tide-pools and basalt wings constrain every step toward the causeway; amber gleam guides the literal transaction and then reappears re-configured inside the reopened eye. Senses are selective: salt rust, violet dawn, iron thunder—each filtered via painter POV. Micro-setting succeeds without landscape overspill.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the need to exchange memory for rest—intensifies as tide tightens the walkway window; cost (loss of family relic + surrender of wakefulness) crystallizes when she closes her eyes to the painted tomorrow. One meaningful tightening only, but it narrows options palpably. Conflict stays legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</figure>
<comment>“Exchange dreams to keep the planet breathing” threads ecological and mnemonic themes without sermonizing; the final image re-weights insomnia from burden to gift without stating a moral. Complexity embraced through the uneasy barter—no false equivalence, just ambiguous necessity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice remains painterly throughout—color scream, sodium dusk, slow sunrise—each metaphor alive under pressure and anchored in Ishka’s palette lexicon. No head-hop or register drift; compressed lyric syntax accrues urgency without obscuring causality. The hush-hush cadence pays off in final line’s ear-echo.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lines carry information density—basalt “old wound reopened,” glass shards bedding “with mussel shells.” One overwritten stretch “gravity itself were pliable in his wake” strays into poetic excess (−0.3), but it does not cloud the final image. Overall rhythm propels to end without paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-war insomnia trading future memories for relic sleep is fresh enough to transcend template. Transformation arises from specific painterly materiality, not abstract dream-science. One recognizable line—“Tomorrow, maybe”—echoes familiar graffiti but is contextualized with earned specificity.</comment>
