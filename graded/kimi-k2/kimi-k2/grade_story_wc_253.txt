<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The farmer’s interiority—grief muted by mandate—rings embodied and specific; the blank-faced performer’s motives remain opaque, but his micro-choices (whittling, petal placement) enact the stated goal. The cedar heart handed over at the end is a credible Earned Stasis that costs both men their remaining shields. Minor drift: the performer’s “blank face” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hollowed cedar heart plus final petal crystallizes a shared, wordless mourning under the remade hush. Causality is accumulative/textural—each whittled shaving and plucked petal layers density until the final scattering reweights the silence. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Farmhouse porch, turbines, and cedar shavings are selective, tactile, and filter through the farmer’s narrowed attention. The turbines’ shadows literally sweep across the porch, guiding the slow choreography of grief. One minor slip: “colorless sky” repeats without fresh sensory charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor forbidden grief—tightens via each petal removed and shaving dropped. The final act (cedar heart + petal) forecloses the option of public mourning; the cost is the mandate-trained silence that swallows even tears. Escalation is steady, not explosive, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mandated joy and smuggled sorrow; the dried bouquet and whittled heart embody the illicit persistence of grief. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: silence becomes almost a lullaby, a conceptual repricing of the remade hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to the farmer’s perceptions; the performer’s blank affect is filtered through the farmer’s wary readings. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, and avoids filter clutter. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden; voices remain distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; figurative language (“pale feathers,” “tiny yellow boat”) is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“lid clamped over screams”—momentarily jars.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia feels freshly grounded in the tactile exchange of cedar and petal rather than exposition. The conceit of “dramatically narrating mundane tasks” could read gimmicky but is earned through the performer’s ritual function. Specificity of grief-smuggling via dried bouquet is memorable.</comment>
