<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse surfacing “like distant surf” under the whirling silence. The arrow-tip memory flash is a sharp micro-choice that re-weights her motive from data-gathering to stewardship. The final pocketing of the tip and the smile of recognition show earned endurance with visible cost. One minor slip: “memorial, each tree fed…” drifts toward label-speak, blunting the embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sapling flares, echoes braid into heartwood, gravity reasserts, and Kael departs carrying the word “endure.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo and arrow shard layers density until the braid locks. Causality is intact: because she inserts the tip, the grove salutes and seals. Cost is legible in the sealed arch and the irreversible shift from observer to guardian.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The inverted river, floating arches, and luminous spores are not backdrop but tactical terrain: Kael navigates by water flow, uses zero-G to reach the mother-tree, and escapes the re-sealing arch. The arrow-tip constellation inside the cavern constrains the final insertion and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One missed sensory layer (smell) is negligible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—source of resilience—tightens when the echoes reveal themselves as stored courage. The pressure point is the narrowing hour of inversion; each beat (scanner tug, arrow vibration, vortex eye) escalates risk and narrows options. Agency is active: she chooses to enter the arch, slot the tip, and accept guardianship. The cost is the sealed path and the irreversible shift in identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the braid of memory and growth: resilience is not botanical but memorial. The arrow constellation and green-flare sapling embody this without sermon. The final word “endure” is earned resonance, not assertion. Complexity is honored—no tidy moral, only the living map of courage now rooted beneath her wings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and precise—“boots grazing the silverleaf canopy,” “stone teeth that snapped shut.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer lyrical lines in calm moments, clipped fragments under time crunch. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Kael. Occasional elevated diction (“venerable mother-tree”) is consistent with her trained observer persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances discovery or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“luminous spores drifted upward and seeded the underside of the floating arches.” No loops, no scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“choir of last stands vibrating through her bones”—is brief and does not blur clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The inversion of gravity and memory-as-nutrient feels inevitable yet fresh. The arrow constellation reforged into living core is a non-obvious synthesis that reweights the premise. Risk is taken—lyric accumulation over causal turns—and pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
