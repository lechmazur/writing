<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is embodied in the saffron veil and her tactile avoidance of patterns; her contradictory impulse to both resurrect and purify memory crystallizes in the final choice to crack the core. The child-self memory anchors motivation and pays off in the Earned Stasis of irreversible truth. No secondary character pressure, but single-POV depth is sustained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism dissolves, the pagoda crumbles, and the historian’s stance crystallizes with the cost of unshielded grief. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each spiral of shelves and memory loop tightens until the final cadence shift. Orientation is taught early by the crumbling arch and humming pagoda; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive’s steadily unpredictable script and dust-thick tiles constrain every footstep; the bronze prism’s hum vibrates in teeth, charging the final image when it turns to dust. Micro-setting (veil, cracked tiles, liquid-light core) guides choices and reweights meaning at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the day innocence ended—tightens through escalating memory loops and the irreversible act of purification. One decisive deepening: cracking the core releases raw grief, foreclosing comforting nostalgia. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates. Cost is felt in the collapsing archive and luminous veil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specific image of saffron pollen and burning fields; no moralizing. The final prism-dust reweights the premise: purification is subtraction, not cleansing. Subtext in the veil’s phosphorescent blood and the child’s crushed firefly charges the ending without statement. Complexity embraced—truth hurts, yet is chosen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“steadily unpredictable,” “atoms of nostalgia”—with rhythmic control that accelerates toward collapse. Perceptual signature filters every detail through the historian’s sensory bias; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“shelves spiraled upward into darkness”) and paid off in the final spiral downward.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“dying star,” “phosphorescent blood”—and never muddle causality. High density: “veil, dyed with the pollen of extinct crocuses, fluttered like a wounded moth” does triple duty. No register drift; prose stays within historian’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of memory physics, saffron extinction, and bronze prism feels inevitable and fresh. The purification-as-subtraction angle transforms familiar “archive of memory” trope. Specificity of extinct-crocus dye and humming bronze anchors universals. Risk in lyric density pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
