<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"pulse left wandering through her ribs"—but the character’s choices are largely symbolic rather than concrete, softening the arc. The final transformation is earned by the accumulative pattern rather than a single decisive act, so the cost feels diffuse. Still, the voice is distinct and the emotional stakes are palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held to the end; each repetition of “centuries of layered dust” tightens the spiral toward stillness. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—her becoming the next tower—charged with conceptual cost. The pattern is legible and the final image reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon and towers are not backdrop but active memory-structures; their “historically reverent grief” constrains her only option: to join them. Sensory selection is urgent—wind equations, crystallized patience—yet never stalls momentum. The micro-setting of her own body-as-map is vivid and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to navigate without moving—escalates through each recursive beat until the only resolution is to become the map. Pressure intensifies via pattern accumulation rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: she trades motion for monumentality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of images—dust, pulse, bone—rather than statement. The final transformation offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stillness as the ultimate navigation. Subtext operates in silence and crystallized grief, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; the repeated cadences (“centuries of layered dust,” “pulse left wandering”) function as incantation, not monotony. Perceptual signature is consistent—she sees through bird-patterns and bone-song. No head-hopping; focalization remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“wings writing equations”—and serve the thematic math. Minor loop risk in “centuries of layered dust” is offset by escalating context each time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—learning stillness by becoming stone memory—feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation of birds into towers and skimmer into monument synthesizes mythic and geological time without cliché. Risk-taking (entire plot in recursive lyric mode) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
