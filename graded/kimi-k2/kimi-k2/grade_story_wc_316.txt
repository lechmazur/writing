<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the numbness vs. thaw is visceral. The twin Kaels’ contradictory impulses—ownership vs. surrender—play out in real time on the tatami. The final co-stewardship choice is earned by the shared admission of numbness and the cost of re-sensitization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: joint custody dissolves into co-authorship, with the vivified brain’s “I am the feeling you outsourced” crystallizing the shift. Causal chain: jar cracked → memories spill → mutual surrender → scroll rewrites. The floating dojo’s event horizon is anchored early; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetized obsidian cradle, glowing tatami, and dripping cerebrospinal fluid are tactile constraints that guide the custody ritual. The jar itself becomes micro-setting, charging the final image when relabeled EMERGENT. Selective sensory detail mirrors the thawing numbness without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who will possess the duplicate brain—tightens when the scroll rewrites itself mid-scene. The decisive micro-turn is the clone kneeling instead of striking; this surrender escalates pressure under the Situational lens and forces the joint-stewardship resolution with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: possession vs. guardianship of shared sensation. The rain inside the jar reweights the earlier memory of tasting rain, offering a non-literal answer to defeating numbness. No moralizing; the scroll’s final line is earned by the scene’s embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, and consistent; “chronal heat,” “theta rhythm,” and “neon cities blinking” feel native to the ex-corporate shaman. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight to the two Kaels’ shared yet distinct perceptions. Dialogue minimal but purposeful—flat vs. whispered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. Metaphors (“newborn sun,” “anesthesia through shared veins”) are precise and never muddle causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the rising pulse of the brain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—custody battle over one’s own duplicated consciousness—feels fresh and fully committed. The floating rock dojo above rewriting history could be gimmicky, but it grounds the emotional stakes. The synthesis of Zen ritual, biotech, and ego death is specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
