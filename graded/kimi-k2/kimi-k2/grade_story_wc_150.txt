<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the diaspora returnee’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home yet fearing its ghosts—surface in her tactile handling of bones and roots. Motivation to “restore lost faith” is dramatized through micro-choices (speaking to bones, aligning the sundial) rather than stated. The final renunciation—leaving the orchard yet carrying its soil—earns its cost on the page. Voice remains coherent, though a few lyrical abstractions (“time learns to circle”) edge toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s first noon light reframes exile as cyclical return, with felt cost in the portable orchard she now bears. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned images of roots, bones, and light accrue until the final image reweights them. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis (how she persuades the gravedigger) is tolerated under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is rendered through sensory triangulation—myrrh-scented wind, iron vines, bone dust motes—each detail filtering the protagonist’s curator gaze. Setting constrains choice: roots dictate excavation paths, the sundial’s shaft of light fixes the final alignment. Spatial choreography holds across the seven-day stay. One near-purple phrase (“cathedral ribs”) is forgiven for its immediate sensory payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring faith in a forsaken soil—is signaled early and tightened by each unearthed bone. Escalation is textural: each relic increases the weight of memory until the sundial’s light crystallizes the cost of remembrance. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the arc. The price—carrying soil that is both orchard and graveyard—is legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of roots and bones: memory is not preserved but grown, a living graft of past to present. Subtext resides in gestures—tracing unreadable letters, cradling a child’s clavicle—rather than exposition. The final image of “pocket-sized dawn” offers a non-literal answer to the question of exile without moralizing. One line of overt thesis (“time devours, but also circles home”) is offset by its placement in a diary fragment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is curator-poet: precise, tactile, yet capable of compressed lyric leaps. Syntax modulates from long, archaeological sentences to the clipped final exchange with the gravedigger. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices patina, fracture, dust motes, never tourist vistas. No POV leakage; even the grandmother’s diary is filtered through present handling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion (“roots threading through skulls with intimate patience”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates during excavation, then exhales at the orchard’s final shimmer. One mixed metaphor (“time learns to circle instead of devour”) is borderline but saved by its conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, and broken sundial feels inevitable yet fresh; no template match found. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Specificity of the curator’s gaze transforms familiar tropes of homecoming and ancestor veneration. The final reconfiguration—“portable orchard of reconciled histories”—is unforeseeable yet earned.</comment>
