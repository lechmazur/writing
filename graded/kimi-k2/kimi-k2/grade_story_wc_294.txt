<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic caretaker vs. time-robber—surface in embodied micro-choices (folding peso into boat, lighting euro). Interiority is specific, but the father-robber lineage is asserted more than dramatized, softening the final renunciation’s cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the burning euro reconfigures the loop from trap to cradle with visible ritual cost. Causal chain (bills as territorial markers → drone retreat) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only a trace of outline drift in the startup backstory keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Abandoned circus train is tactile—warped floorboards, lion cage bars—yet never traps bodies; instead it supplies the ritual stage that constrains the final choice. Dusky harmony saturates without cliché, and the paper-money fence becomes micro-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—whether to stay inside the looping ruin or exit—tightens when demolition drones appear. Escalation is one deepening beat: marking the loop with currency buys a night’s reprieve and crystallizes Leo’s stance. Cost is felt (loss of last 5-euro keepsake), though external pressure could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of circularity emerges through concrete particulars—foreign bills, lion cage, drone circle—without moralizing. Final image of burning euro reweights the premise: the loop is cradle, not trap. Subtext in Mara’s silence and Leo’s match-strike carries more than dialogue ever could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; diction (“polished calm,” “dusky harmony”) belongs to Leo’s perceptual signature. Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Only minor scaffold—“rose on a surge…then collapsed” could tighten—keeps it from 9.0. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; final ash image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crypto-startup meets derailed circus via foreign currency ritual. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without lion-cage cradle and paper-money fence. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; echoes feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
