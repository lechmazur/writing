<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and glass-specific; the mentor’s palm-code and “follow the pause” crystallize motive. Yet the cartel remains off-stage, so external pressure is second-hand and the final renunciation (“not to avenge but to remember”) is asserted rather than forced by an immediate, embodied choice—cost is felt but not paid in a visible forfeiture beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost lattice → obsidian trail → kiln-ghost projection tightens pattern rather than causal chain. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the turquoise shard fuses and projects the full ledger, reweighting beauty’s complicity in smuggling; the price is the irreversible knowledge now burned into canyon walls. Orientation is clean by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and glass pool function as micro-settings that constrain movement and finally project truth. The warm glass under her palm is tactile, specific, and charges the culminating image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to use the ledger for revenge or memory—tightens when the frost trail proves the kiln still exhales. The projection beat forecloses denial; options narrow to witness. Cost is conceptual (burden of complete betrayal) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass metaphors: transparency vs. concealment, beauty weaponized. The final projection reframes earlier “drifting resonance” as ethical obligation without moralizing. Subtext in frost “writing” and the mentor’s pause pattern deepens on re-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to sensorium, glass-maker diction (“color learned to sing”) consistent throughout. Rhythm modulates with altitude: long breaths at starlit opening, shorter clauses amid steam and shard. No head-hop; compression (“sleep was a shallow pool”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence variety and information density high; each image advances pattern or stakes. Occasional poetic overlap (“frost feathers that feathered”) is intentional cadence reinforcement, not loop. Metaphors stay within glass/canyon physics; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of cartel thriller with artisan lyric is fresh; kiln as waypoint and frost as map invert expected surveillance tech. Risk resides in quiet closure, but repricing of glass itself justifies the gamble. Could edge higher with one more concrete detail that only this canyon could contain.</comment>
