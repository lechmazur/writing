<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Helini’s interiority is embodied and specific; the compass-under-tongue beat crystallizes her renunciation with felt cost. The withheld apology and final drift toward “blue beyond apology” trace a credible internal arc. Only the apprentice remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of lace, compass, and mist deepens until the cedar-box sealing reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the tutor’s stance crystallizes with compass beneath tongue and trees “pointing toward the open sea.” Cost is legible in the swallowed cold point and the wordless vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Islet, rain-soaked boards, salt air, and juniper twig all constrain choice and charge the final image. Micro-setting (cedar box, moss, compass) functions as setting-objects that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—tightens once via the mist-given instruction and the compass’s new bearing. Escalation is accretive: each lace row, mist shift, and needle tremor reweights regret. Cost is visible in the swallowed compass and the relinquished student.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of apology-as-color emerges from concrete particulars (lace holes, mist hues) without moralizing. Final image of “blue beyond apology” reweights prior motifs with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in silence and withheld color; complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: syntactic elongation mirrors slow bonsai cadence, perceptual signature is tutor-specific. No dialogue; internal voice remains coherent under pressure. Patterned elision (mist instructions) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Minor elevated diction (“cerulean regret”) stays within lyric contract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusion of bonsai craft, maritime ghost lore, and textile magic feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No recognizable template; specificity prevents swap-out. Final reconfiguration of trees as ships is unforeseeable yet earned.</comment>
