<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “listening” gift is embodied in tactile beats (keys on fountain, palm on mailbox). The final act of hanging the locket is earned by her prior micro-choices and carries visible communal cost. One minor slip: the phrase “pulse felt urgent” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mailbox opens, letters spill, courtyard exhales. Causal chain (hear rattle → trace locket → return it) holds under Causal lens with felt communal cost. No orientation drift; anchors set by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard tiles, rosemary scent, and welded mailbox constrain Mira’s path and charge the final image. Micro-setting (mailbox iron) functions as crucible. One hairline slip: “muted amber” sky is slightly stock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal sealed grief—tightens when curfew sirens intrude, forcing Mira to act. One decisive turn: she chooses to open mailbox despite external threat, paying communal emotional cost. Agency drives escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges organically from Mira’s method and the courtyard’s collective catharsis. Final image of locket on mailbox door offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“pulse of every chipped saucer,” “scent sharp enough to cut”—anchors lyric voice. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor (“metal answered metal; the solder cracked like dry earth”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar grief-ritual trope is transformed through sensory specificity and communal stakes. Fresh inflection: curator returning artifact to “rightful exhibit.” Risk-taking (lyric causality) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
