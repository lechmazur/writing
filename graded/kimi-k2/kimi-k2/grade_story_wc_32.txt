<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s stoic sensitivity and heretical resolve drive every micro-choice. The final surrender of blood and memory feels earned, with visible cost (bleeding palm, emptied past). Minor drift: “hopeless” label is asserted early but not dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the vivified crozier rewrites dogma into open inquiry, cost paid in blood and exile. Causal chain holds—each ingredient and surrender tightens options—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; twilight anchor is immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus and twilight bloom are not backdrop but crucible: heat, light, and hush directly enable the transmutation and charge the final image of wing-shaped coals. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the alchemist’s ritual focus. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interrupt calcified destiny—tightens through each ingredient added and each memory surrendered. Escalation is Accumulative: density of ritual, cost of blood, and reconfiguration of the crozier’s meaning. One decisive intensification suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of creative destruction emerges organically from ritual action; no moralizing. Final commandment “unmake what was made too certain” reweights prior dogma without sermon. Ambiguity lingers—cathedrals unlatched, bell towers cracked—inviting reflection rather than dictating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates under ritual pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: soot-stained robes, violet embers, copper taste. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the alchemist’s sensorium. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and action without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“luminous scar singing with new scripture” lands. Minor loop risk in successive “approximation” phrasing, but cadence shift at climax prevents monotony. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses alchemy, relic, and heresy into a fresh synthesis; crozier-as-seraph is unforeseeable yet inevitable. Transformation test passes: story collapses if any element is swapped. Risk-taking (ritual vivification of a liturgical object) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
