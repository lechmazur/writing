<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid—her “methodically playful” trait drives every micro-choice, from tapping the nickel to pressing it into the heart. The contradiction between restoring permanence and craving impermanence is embodied, not stated. The final renunciation—leaving brushes, walking lighter—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Only the hobo’s miniature scale strains embodiment slightly, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each sonic layer intensifies pigment awakening until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lila’s deliberate flaw and lighter gait crystallize the cost of choosing curiosity over certainty. The hobo’s warning (“you will become the next layer”) is the felt price that lingers. Pattern taught early (sound-garden chords) and paid off in the wall’s new hum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is no backdrop; its bronze reeds supply the very medium that awakens pigment and later hushes to a secret-keeping whisper. Micro-setting—the nickel doorway—constrains the final choice by literally swallowing the coin. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Lila hears pitches, feels bone-conducted voice. Only a faint risk of tourist-catalog listing in the color cascade keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—certainty vs. curiosity—is signaled in the third sentence and tightened when the hobo demands “one answer for one wonder.” The final choice to embed the nickel and leave the flaw forecloses the path of perfect restoration with visible cost. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Coincidence (miniature hobo) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and impermanence; no statement, only the image of Lila walking lighter while the wall dreams onward. The nested awakenings motif reweights at closure: restorer becomes pigment, future restorer will wake her. Subtext in the hobo’s grinning doorway offers a non-literal answer to what happens “after the last color wakes.” No moralizing, only resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“colors woke in layers,” “sky pulsed inside the heart.” Perceptual signature is Lila’s synesthetic attention to pitch and pigment. Compression taught early (“every footstep chimed”) and held through the final whispered steps. No POV leakage; even the hobo’s voice arrives through her wrist bones, not omniscient ventriloquism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—sound as pigment, doorway as grin—never ornamental. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long cadences for wonder, clipped for the hobo’s warning. No mixed metaphors or register drift; the elevated diction remains within Lila’s artistic lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The hobo nickel as portal, the sound-garden as tuning fork, and the restorer-becomes-paint reversal synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky miniature scale and synesthetic magic are fully committed to, not hedged. Transformation test: swap any element and the emotional arc collapses. Specificity—“1937 became a tiny doorway”—anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
