<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cartographer’s interior contradiction—yearning to create yet fearing the cost—drives every beat; her micro-choice to sketch equations in frost embodies the trait “groundedly imaginative” and forecloses easier miracles. The final renunciation (accepting limits) is earned by prior modeling and carries visible cost: the quill dulls, the spire seals. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV interiority is specific and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian threads fuse with her vellum, crystallizing a sustainable future and foreclosing exploitative paths. Causal lens holds—each equation she scratches (“population curves, resource gradients”) directly shapes the spire’s response. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening when she adds the closed-loop sigil; cost is legible in the spent nib and sealed spire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian spire’s warmth and volcanic memory constrain her tactics—she must ground innovation in geological fact. Frozen lake’s seasonal melt becomes the literal energy source she models; micro-setting (frost on vellum) functions as tool. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and thermal detail over visual catalog. Final image of icegrass shoots rooting along her modeled melt patterns charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seed innovation within constraint—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when she refuses the “easy miracle.” Escalation is causal: each equation narrows the spire’s response until only the sustainable loop remains. Cost is visible: dull nib, sealed spire, unchosen paths. No coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: sustainable creation born of limitation. Subtext in the spire’s “memory of every eruption” reframes human innovation as geological collaboration. Final image of icegrass roots following her equations offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent; perceptual signature filters detail through cartographer’s professional gaze (“charting blank spaces”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long reflective sentences give way to spare, equation-like fragments during modeling. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; “sigil” and “lattice” fit her vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“spiraling upward like a signature” is apt. Rhythm accelerates during frost-sketching, then exhales at closure. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Premise—writing the future on an obsidian spire that remembers every eruption—is fresh synthesis of geology and epistemology. Kingfisher quill transformed from relic to modeling stylus feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression succeeds; closure image of icegrass roots recharges earlier melt equations. No derivative templates.</comment>
