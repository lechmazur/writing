<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—palms tingling with “rational enchantment,” the lullaby memory folding fear like paper—but the final surrender reads slightly abstract; the cost is felt more as concept than embodied consequence, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s choice to weave herself into the gallery’s cortex forecloses escape with visible conceptual cost (“eyes open, weaving endlessly”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each pattern intensifies until surrender is the only remaining texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gallery breathes, liquefies, loops—environment actively constrains every move. The sinew-thread-as-setting micro-anchors Mara’s choices; mirrors and corridors reconfigure under her touch, charging the final image of her fused nervous system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the texture of connection—tightens when Mara realizes the gallery feeds on architects. One decisive intensification: cutting the thread fails, surrender is the only path left; cost is the permanent loss of self-boundary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-control emerges organically from the literal act of weaving oneself into the system; no moralizing, only the resonant image of “a knot that could never be untied.” Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is fever-bright, syntactically controlled—“realistically imaginary,” “unsettling calm”—with perceptual signature sustained. No head-hopping; curator’s borrowed mouth serves as externalized projection, not POV breach.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern-teaching (“threads writhing like eels”). No loops or scaffold; final image crystallizes without overwriting. Minor elevation in register at “conceptual cortex” is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise reframes the haunted-house trope as cognitive architecture; sinew harvested from nightmares, gallery as synaptic mind—specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky second-person mirror payoff lands cleanly.</comment>
