<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s internal arc is coherent: the impulse to “repair” becomes the acceptance of impermanence with visible cost (the empty film canister). Interiority is sensuous—trembling fingers, luminous ache—rather than diagnostic. Micro-choices (not stopping the hand but tilting the lens) tether motives to action and foreclose the former goal. The emotional contradiction is embodied early and paid later, satisfying the earned-cost clause.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure—empty canister, now-motionless hand—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern’s density peaks as the film becomes “transparent” and the clock hand rests, forcing the reader to recalculate sight, loss, and escape. The drive holds from the spinning hand to the final image. Cost is unmistable: “the ache inside her answered, bright and hollow.” A single tightening, no plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome, brass gear, and moon-dust grains are handled, not catalogued; each constrains choice (tilting the lens toward the void instead of Earth-light). Sensory selection is biased by Elara’s profession—precision tools, “brass casing,” “silver blur”—and the final image repurposes the reflective hand as fractured moons. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The environment actively charges the closure unit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“harness the ephemeral” versus surrender to it—tightens once through a credible turn (re-tuning the lens for streak imagery) that forecloses the repair mission. The price is dramatized: “empty canister,” “luminous husk.” Agency remains consistently on the page; no coincidence rescues. One deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme of impermanence and surrender emerges organically from concrete objects (spinning hand, emptied film). There is no didactic statement; the reversal is subtextual and embodied in the final image. The luminous ache reconfigures meaning rather than preaching it. The resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose carries a hush, lyrical-technical register unique to a camera-repairer-sage: “gear train had rearranged itself into a spiral.” Rhythm modulates with seismic rise and breathless fall. Sensory filtering is character-true; no POV leakage. Compression and ellipsis are taught early and resolved.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every line advances story or atmosphere; no padding loops. Metaphor density is high but consistently paid off (spinning hand → rocket unwinding seconds). Sentence variety prevents drumbeat. Clean pronoun control. Final line “luminous husk that no longer hurt to hold” crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<grade>9.2</question>
<comment>The frame—“moon observatory cameras teaching escape velocity”—is non-clichéd and transforms the technical term into poetic constraint. Synthesis feels inevitable only after reading; no scene functions identically with generic substitutions. The risk of transparent-film imagery is fully committed to and lands with emotional cost.</comment>
