<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—shrapnel ribs, violet seams mapping futures—but the final broadcast gesture feels slightly abstract; the cost is legible yet not fully dramatized in her body. Motivation stays coherent: grief transmuted into perturbation hunt. Micro-choices (sealing half the geode, thumbing the console) anchor stakes. Still, the shift from private ritual to external broadcast could use one more embodied beat to earn the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the grave of potential becomes the medium she now moves through, broadcast on all channels. Causal chain holds—geode calculations → orbital release → algorithmic falter—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the “clean surgical” vision that slices her open. Minor waver: the rebooting observatory could be one sentence tighter to crystallize the irreversible shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating observatory, copper domes, coolant mist, and geode-as-micro-moon constrain every move; spatial choreography is exact. Sensory hierarchy (violet seams, auroras, zero-g cradle) mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. The setting’s cooling breakers act as live clock, tightening final choices. One stray—“widowed moon” edges toward poetic excess—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating and reclaiming unused potential—tightens through each calibration and orbital release. Agency is continuous: repurposing instruments, rerunning models, broadcasting coordinates. Cost escalates from private grief to system-level perturbation. The tightening is singular but sufficient; the drones’ silence answers with metallic cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repurposed loss emerges through concrete acts—spectrographing grief, mapping graves—never stated. Final image refracts every vow across violet light, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the geode’s pulse registering on seismographs. Complexity lingers: potential neither saved nor erased, but re-circulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, and character-bound: “intangibly tangible,” “bleak exhilaration” feel coined by her mind. Syntax modulates with pressure—long accumulative sentences under auroras, staccato release at airlock. No head-hop; POV stays locked. One near-repeat—“intangibly tangible” appears thrice—just avoids loop status by serving as pulse motif.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, physics, and emotion. Metaphors are precise—geode as “miniature moon of mourning.” No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Minor register lift in “perturbation theory” fits her scientific repurposing. Clean copy; rhythm breathes with scene beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drone-survivor grief with orbital quantum cartography—fresh synthesis, inevitable in hindsight. Geode-as-grave-mapper transforms trope of crystalline memory. Risk of lyric abstraction is embraced yet grounded in embodied stakes. Final broadcast to drone fleets reconfigures genre expectations without gimmickry.</comment>
