<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Witness’s interiority is vivid—cedar/ozone scent, dictionary’s weight loss—but her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. dissolve meaning) are stated more than dramatized. Micro-choices (aligning “unify” with vacuum quill, pressing palm to lectern) are embodied and specific. Final swallow of the dot is a decisive renunciation with felt cost, yet the shift from observer to librarian feels slightly bestowed rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of vanishing definitions, tightening spiral, and hush density. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—library folds into her chest, cosmos re-reads itself—cost legible in her fragmentation and the blank dictionary. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but taught early; causality is lyrical, not linear, yet coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is richly sensory—tessellated floor, petrified-dawn lectern, Möbius aisles—and constrains movement: the spiral path literally shapes her tactics. Micro-setting (dictionary as tactile anchor) charges the final image when it becomes a pulse in her hand. Spatial logic is dream-coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witness must decide whether to preserve or release the last word. Escalation is textural—definitions evaporate, spiral tightens—until the blank page forces the choice. Cost is the erasure of her own witness identity, paid on the page. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of unity-through-erasure emerges from concrete events: vanishing ink, collapsing tenses, swallowed dot. Subtext whispers in “resounding hush” and “paper bird returning home.” Final image of cosmos reading itself aloud offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity honored; no tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “galaxies stutter,” “sentences orbited her like fireflies.” Perceptual signature is cosmically scaled yet intimate. Patterned elision (e.g., “wanderingly exact”) is taught early and paid off. No POV drift; diction stays within witness’s numinous lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept. Occasional stacked metaphors (“black hole of meaning”) risk overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax, longer coils during spiral walk.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eschatology with bibliophilia in a fresh synthesis; “librarian of the beginning” reframes apocalypse as genesis. Risky lyric structure holds together under Accumulative lens. Specificity of petrified dawn, vacuum quill, and cedar-ozone scent grounds the cosmic. Transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
