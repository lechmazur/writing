<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is specific—walking the lace of her own unease—and the contradiction between ambition and reconciliation is felt in her chest when she swallows flame; Earned Stasis is viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every image layers, tightening choices until the final reconfiguration reweights memory itself; cost is palpable in the act of inhaling starlight and exhaling mercy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory curation—cobalt grotto, quartz seam, iron-and-pine resin heat—grounds POV under pressure and constrains the climb; each detail cues action, tightening the mountain’s hold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the sky will die within three nights—compresses time; each beat of ascent raises bodily cost and ethical stakes, culminating in the queen choosing to carry (and become) the spark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: lantern, firefly, first spark—never moralised. The final image reconfigures crown as blessing rather than burden; ambiguity around mercy lingers, earned by bodily ordeal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression and pattern teach early: lace of menace becomes lace of memory via rhythmic repetition, paid off in closure. Perceptual signature—“wispers plotting”—remains consistent, no filter drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or artifact clog during peak beats; every sentence multi-tasks. Metaphor density is earned—frozen lightning, violet flames—and controlled so the final image stays vivid, not murky.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen-meets-child encounter is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight; personal mythology is reframed without tropes, the firefly lantern’s redemption specific to this psychic terrain.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Setup: stated on line 1. Drives two causal beats—ascetic climb and flame inhalation—charging earned stasis in the final image.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Early setup, middle development, and closure: the grotto hosts the queen’s climactic negotiation with child-self; its cooling stone literalizes the cost of absorption.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Foregrounded from the astronomers’ warning, starlight is not only celestial backdrop—it is the literal payload the queen inhales and transforms, reconfiguring sky and self.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Trait appears thrice in voice that “softly commands” the mountain; the cadence itself becomes performative, guiding the shared exhale and crystallising the choice.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>The climb is not locomotion but crucible: every step tightens stakes; it redefines the queen’s agency and makes the flame-swallowing possible.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Prophesied method enacted on the ridge—queen and younger self perform the shared exhale—transforming firefly into violet ribbon; mechanics explicitly dictate the closure image.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>Acts as mirror and origin of ambition; cobalt grotto above clouds anchors memory and reappears refracted in dawn’s new light at closure, a visible reweighting.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>The three-night countdown compresses urgency into the queen’s body; time pressure alters pacing and choice—final ascent on final night.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Dream-quest is not abstract; queen’s climb is literal real-time method of solving the “first spark” mystery, with cost paid on the ridge.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</question><quote>Lacy menace shifts from threat to memorial lace as the pattern deepens—tone evolves with each turn and remains coherent to the closing word.
