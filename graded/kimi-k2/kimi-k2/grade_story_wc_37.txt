<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—“pulse of a heart that was not hers” grounds empathy in tactile contact. Motivation (save the orchard) is clear, but the final scattering of her own memories feels slightly under-motivated; we don’t feel the cost to her identity until the last sentence. Micro-choices (kneeling, tying the blossom) reveal hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so 9+ gate not met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn-thread and blossom layers density until the tapestry reconfigures the sky. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—orchard breathes, night peels away, her memories scatter as seeds—cost is legible in “lighter now.” Orientation is taught early via mica window and etched runes. One transition (stepping inside) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse, mica panes, glowing fruit, and etched lullabies are vivid and selective. The mica window constrains the final image—its brightening reflection becomes the sky. Spatial choreography is coherent; trees lean, she climbs, tapestry settles. No static cataloging; every detail is filtered through her urgent perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the realm from final frost—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accumulative: each dawn-thread and blossom tightens the weave against unraveling night. Cost is visible—her memories scatter, voice cracks. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-salvation emerges through concrete acts: stealing dawns, tasting first peach, braiding grass crowns. Final image of a child tasting a peach and remembering her name offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in runic lullabies and mirrored river carries cultural memory. No thematic drift or explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded—“air tasted of iron and lullabies” marries danger and comfort. Perceptual signature is consistent: selective noticing of glowing fruit, etched runes, grass crowns. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breath-like sentences under canopy, short fragments during climb. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and paid off—“fish scales,” “woven dawns,” “mother tucking in a fevered child.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with emotional beats. Minor risk of overwriting in “unbearably white,” but it serves the climactic sensory overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—dying world, memory guardian—are transformed through tactile specificity: thread spun from stolen sunrises, peach-blossom as infant. Synthesis feels inevitable; no close echoes. Risk in lyric accumulation is rewarded by coherent closure. Conceptual integrity holds; no retreat into abstraction.</comment>
