<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—wanting to fix grief in stone yet learning it must flow—drives every beat; the embodied moment of touching the glowing ribbon and deciding to carve a single line shows earned change with visible cost. Her flaws (inability to “lift” grief alone) shape tactics and final stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Slight reserve: spectral mentor’s guidance edges toward convenient wisdom rather than earned friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carved gravestone and the village’s wordless weeping reconfigure collective grief into migration, cost legible in the stone’s single line and the butterflies’ departure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dusk visit layers density until the final calm. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s wet loam, bruised citrus, and vibrating glass constrain mood and action; the ribbon and chisel act as micro-settings that literally guide Mara’s cuts. Final image of the stone catching dawn light and tears recharges the setting’s sensory palette. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to shape communal grief—tightens from refusal to release, through nightly readings and carvings, culminating in the single-line stone that forecloses monumentality. Agency clear; cost is the letting-go of fixed form. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence and migration; the carved river-wing line offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the butterflies drinking from grooves and villagers weeping “without knowing why” deepens the thematic echo. No late thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with sensory diction (“pollen drifted like pale snow”) and rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Mara; no head-hop. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, sound, or motion. No loops or mixed metaphors. The single-line stone image crystallizes without overwriting. Minor elevated diction (“fiercely meditative”) is voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carving as butterfly migration map transforms a familiar grief trope. The ribbon-to-wing metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
