<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between Kellerman’s detachment and her growing entanglement is dramatized through micro-choices (kneeling, striking the match, speaking aloud). The final renunciation—choosing resistance over data—earns its cost by the father’s revealed sacrifice. Minor slip: “watchfully calm” is repeated as label rather than embodied in the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s stance toward preventable death shifts from statistical to testimonial, with the lantern left burning as visible cost. Causal chain holds—each discovery (compass rose, scars, journal) tightens options until she must reframe her report. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tunnel’s mineral drips, rust patterns, and compass-scorched bricks constrain Maya’s measurements and later reveal the route’s history. Lantern light reconfigures the space into a map of escape; the final image of rain tapping grates charges the setting with applause-like release. Micro-setting (toolkit satchel) also functions as setting-object hybrid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to file death as statistic or resistance—tightens when the journal proves her father’s death was deliberate. One decisive turn: she chooses to name preventable deaths as acts of resistance, paying the cost of breaking Kellerman’s doctrine. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: data vs. witness, safety vs. solidarity. The lantern’s North Star motif reweights from artifact to beacon without overt statement. Final image—rain as applause—offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures grief into purpose. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the sealed path.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, sensory, and character-specific: “the lantern’s copper ribs still smelled faintly of coal smoke.” Compression and patterned elision (“sound and light swapping roles”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift; diction stays within Maya’s investigative lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers temperature, humidity, and memory without redundancy. Metaphors (“flame became a scream”) are coherent under pressure. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she noted… she traced… she read”) mid-story, but artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: preventable-death investigator meets underground-railroad archaeology. Lantern as time-bridge and North Star reprises historical escape routes through personal memory. Risky compression of past and present pays off in the final silhouette of conspirator, not victim.</comment>
