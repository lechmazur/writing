<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra’s interior contradiction—truth-telling vs. self-protection—drives every beat; the moment she speaks her withheld apologies to the vapor, the cost (loss of safe silence) is embodied in the brightening mist. Micro-choices (pocketing the postal plate, planting vials) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible stakes. The shift from gilded ink to plain rice paper crystallizes earned change. Minor slip: the “brother’s last letter dissolved unanswered” is summary, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s rule (truth only) forces Lysandra to voice withheld apologies, reconfiguring her future path—she will now “return the words to living tongues.” Causal linkage holds: map fragment → archive → vial → planting → new growth. One transition (hatch descent) is clean. Cost is legible in the mango tree’s exhale and her own relinquishment of silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city’s glass, acid rain, and respirator moss constrain every move; the mango tree’s roots splitting the dome floor literally blocks the path to the hatch. Sensory selection (crushed-mint apology, hissing rain) filters through Lysandra’s urgency. The final silver-leafed tea plants etched with voices charge the closing image. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost honest speech—tightens when the archive’s rule demands she speak aloud her withheld truths; the price is the irreversible loss of her protective silence. Escalation is causal: each vial collected and planted raises the stakes of public truth-telling. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the mango tree’s relief is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of candor emerges through the archive’s vapor logic and Lysandra’s embodied cost; no explicit moralizing. The final image—tea leaves etched with remembered voices—offers a non-literal answer: truth must be replanted daily. Subtext in the wilting vine and brightening vapor avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: copper-ink shimmer, beetle-shell strokes, respirator moss—details filtered through Lysandra’s craft. Rhythm modulates with pressure; short clauses during hatch descent accelerate tension. No head-hopping; interiority stays concrete (“sweat fogging the glass”). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (“Grow”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: “zinc-etched postal codes no courier had dared deliver” does world, character, and stakes in one line. Metaphors are precise (vine as barometer). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor purple in “toxic sky bruised violet” is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: postal-archive of spoken vapor, gilded-leaf calligraphy, and greenhouse survivalism cohere into an organic whole. The lost-conversations premise is transformed through tactile specificity (vials, wax-sealed vapor). Risky lyric compression pays off in the final silver-leafed tea shoots.</comment>
