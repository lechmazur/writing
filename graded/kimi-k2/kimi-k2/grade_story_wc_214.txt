<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor’s interiority is vivid—his slow, root-like curiosity and willingness to let the void enter him are embodied in tactile micro-choices (kneeling, pressing forehead to floor, opening his chest). The final renunciation—breathing out instead of sweeping—earns its cost through prior vulnerability. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station’s backward-counting chronometer and beating constellation reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light threads and meteors intensifies until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is taught early via the cracked domes and lantern shard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s brass gears, cracked domes, and meteor-scratched sky are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the yellow lantern glass evolves from shard to heart, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent; the barefoot walk among light filaments is tactile. One notch below 9+ only because the environment does not physically block an alternative path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the janitor can hear the station’s silence—tightens when meteors veer toward him after he equalizes pressure. The cost is visible: his pulse flickers, centuries of neglect spiral backward. Agency drives the turn, though the price could be even more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as doorway, not wound. The final image of the lantern becoming a beating heart reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the amber ripples and collective sighs; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“meteors scratched pale signatures across the black parchment of space.” Perceptual signature is consistent: the janitor notices through tactile, cosmic metaphors. Patterned elision (e.g., “the sky had forgotten how to speak”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during meteor landings, longer breaths in stillness. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a cosmic janitor who heals abandoned star-trackers by surrendering to darkness. Familiar tropes (lighthouse shard, meteor seeds) are transformed through embodied specificity. The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by tactile grounding.</comment>
