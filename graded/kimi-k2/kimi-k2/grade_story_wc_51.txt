<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Deep embodiment: her ribs "calcify without breaking," her collarbones feel "wet wool." Internal contradiction sustains—she both gathers and surrenders burdens. The avalanche failure is dramatized not explained; its weight absorbs flame in the climax. Micro-choices (tilting burner, pursed exhales) scale motive. Earned stasis: calcified bones decide she can leave but remain permanently alloyed to grotto. All high-band tests met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—weight accumulates as textured frost until pattern break (sphere absorbed by flame, then re-plated into bronze). Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—last stanza reweights "some weights are meant to be carried by stone." Visible cost in the grotto’s warm bronze heartbeat and her new calcified gait links. Orientation crisp by clause two. One micro transition (inside → outside) allowed and paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory economy drives stakes: bronze drip, oxidized ribs, whalebone reverie across walls. Micro-setting becomes active—walls accept burdens, exhale after settling weights. Spatial anchoring sustained ("under starlight filtering through cracks") and mirrored in burner shadows. Constraints crystallize final stance: stone not flesh now holds. 9+ gate test met: grotto calcifies to constrain and carry her absolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measure all gathered burdens before escape—signaled early. Accumulative pressure escalates via sphere-to-flame absorption culminating in calcification; options foreclose when bronze reclaims her body. Cost is visceral: coral-to-stone transformation visible on page. No external antagonist; burden itself is pressure. Closure reconfigures her walking world into tethered gentleness. Meets 8.8+ guardrails.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of guilt's weight transformed from crushing to held emerges quietly through embodied acts rather than statement. Motifs (frost, bronze shingled hush, whalebone light) accumulate meaning through texture then reprice at end when "shingled hush kept its own slow time" accepts perpetual custody. Avoids tidy moral; instead offers open resonance. Penalty-free for high-band though hair short of 8.9 resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Luminous lyric voice, controlled syntax fractaling to mirror title craft. Perceptual signature sharp—"each bead sliding...like a slow confession"—biased to metallics and marine. Rhythm calibrates pressure; sentences elongate when sphere loosens, compress to creaks when stone seals. No dialogue; evaluative note met. Elisions pattern-taught early and paid off in final disappearing smoke. 9+ met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high information density (single sentences doing sensory, metaphor, motive): "She lifted the burner, tilting it so the flame elongated..." Metaphors disciplined to embodied stakes; no mixed vehicle violations. Exceptional sonic pattern without algorithmic cadence. Closing image—cooling lamp, smoke spelling her name—precise, non-scaffolded. Only hairline slip: slight register wobble in "calcify without breaking" but justified by lyric lens. Clean up to final clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis—frost-feather weights + bronze absolution + marine echoes—felt inevitable yet uncliched. Fractal loom made literal absence then reweighted to stone custody at close. Risk in abstract concepts (shingled hush, whalebone reverie) paid off by charged specificity. Near-echo of ancient myth but transformed through embodied labor and marine salvage. Meets 8.8+; close to 9+ territory but absence of overt innovation keeps .1 short.</comment>
