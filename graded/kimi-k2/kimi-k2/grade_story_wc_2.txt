<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—oil-and-regret rag, “beneath the ashes of every plan”—and his micro-choice to kneel and dip the compass reconfigures his stance with visible cost. The shift from mending certainty to teaching improvisation is earned, though the widow’s backward-running clock is more reported than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: fused compass, wordless clock-face “Perhaps,” and Elian’s new vocation all reweight the premise with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—compass tug → lake parts → cabin memory → fused instrument—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens pattern rather than linear reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Greenhouse trapdoor, petrified-wood stairs, and black lake that “reflected nothing” are selective, tactile, and constrain every choice. The subterranean waterfall charges the final image when its echo becomes the workshop’s heartbeat, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live once certainty fractures—tightens when three clocks stop at 11:17, forcing Elian to choose descent or denial. The cost is legible: he forfeits conventional repair for improvisational mentorship, a felt trade-off under Accumulative pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of provisional maps emerges from concrete particulars—compass roses, backward clocks, wordless dials—without moralizing. Final image of the never-settling needle offers a resonant, non-literal answer: embrace the pause between ticks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “leaves turned like a page,” “lake parted like a curtain.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; “oil and regret,” “dry bones” are precise and earned. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest tropes—lost relic, secret passage—are transformed through clockwork metaphysics and the fresh angle of teaching uncertainty. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking (backward-running time, wordless clock) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
