<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the camera wheel vs releasing every story—are dramatized in real time; the final renunciation costs her the very tool that defined her scavenger identity, an earned stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fragment gathered intensifies the pattern until the backward carousel unwinds every regret; the closure beat—“carousel completed its backward circuit and halted again, this time forever”—delivers resonant reconfiguration with felt loss of all stored stories.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, brass horses, and mirrored water are not backdrop; they physically constrain negotiation and ultimately fold into the silver coin that drops into her pocket, charging the final image with earned specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release every ambition to restart the ride—tightens once: each fragment returned raises the cost until the single remaining option is total surrender; the price is dramatized as the camera wheel clicks empty and vanishes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambition emerges from the tactile negotiation; the final backward turn offers a non-literal answer—time rewound, regret dissolved—without moralizing, leaving a charged poise that invites reflection on what remains after everything is let go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“brass horses still breathed steam into the kinetic lagoon”) and perceptual signature that filters every image through Mara’s scavenger bias; compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure; figurative language is sparse, purposeful, and never muddies causality; final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Carousel-as-memory-lagoon, time-shifting negotiation with splintered selves, and the disposable camera as mechanical heart form a fresh synthesis; the backward ride that unwinds regret is both inevitable and non-obvious, a bold structural choice that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
