<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (obedience to the library’s hush vs. the urge to act) play out in micro-choices like tracing the grotto rock and slipping diagrams under doors. The final renunciation—teaching the rebellion quietly—earns its cost in the dawn fatigue and the promise of endless tomorrow. One slip: the “unspoken words” trait is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the synchronized displays crystallize the town’s new stance while Mara’s promise to keep teaching forecloses louder revolt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the twilight pulse reweights meaning. Cost is legible in her locked-door walk home through the grotto, “cradled like a winning endgame.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and mist function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: the library’s hush demands secrecy, the grotto’s tug aligns hearts, the mist thickens stakes. Sensory detail is selective—fogged windows, iron-rich stone, star-scratched constellations—filtered through Mara’s urgency. One hairline slip: “shuttered shops” is slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><<comment>Dominant stake—planting second thoughts—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s agency: diagrams under doors, shopkeepers’ cooperation, twilight pulse. The tightening is one decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in her dawn exhaustion and the irreversible public shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet subversion over loud protest. The chess motif reframes power without preaching; the final star-constellation checkmate reweights the premise wordlessly. No moralizing—only the hush that “walked outside in small shoes.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“humble rebellion,” “forests of second thoughts”). Perceptual signature is Mara’s—she hears books regret, feels magnetic tug as “librarian’s shawl.” No head-hopping; compression taught early (“cobalt library in mist”) and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor elevation (“prophecy walked outside”) is earned by pattern. Final line cadence mirrors opening fog-breath, achieving closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—chess pedagogy as quiet revolution, magnetic grotto as civic heart—is fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; the town-wide window display feels singular to this voice.</comment>
