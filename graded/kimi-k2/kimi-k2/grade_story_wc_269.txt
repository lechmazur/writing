<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied in tactile memory (ghost-white reef) and micro-choices (tapping the wall, kneeling to lift the page). Her motivation—discover why routes vanish—drives every beat, culminating in the descent and renunciation of data-logging. The cost is felt: she logs no data, anchoring herself to sky and abyss. One character only; no relationship crucible required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored atlas page and silver thread reconfigure the premise—paths wait for witnesses. Causality is lyrical but intact: tapping rhythms → station tremor → coordinates → descent → restoration. Orientation is clear by line 4; no disorientation. The final image crystallizes options with visible cost (secrecy, solitude).</comment>

<comment>The station’s titanium legs, bioluminescent plankton, and glass-smooth circle constrain every move; the raft and sextant are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (ghost-white reef, solder-lit seams). Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room syndrome. Environment guides choice and anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why routes vanish—tightens through each beat: erased charts → coordinates → unsounded circle → folded paths. Agency is renunciation: she chooses descent and silence, foreclosing data as a path. Cost is legible: she logs nothing, accepting perpetual secrecy. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: vanished lanes, bleached reef, silver thread—paths as memory awaiting witness. Subtext operates in gesture (tapping) and silence (no logged data). The ending offers a non-literal answer—paths fold until witnessed—without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the image of coral-bright sails below.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control matching the tapping motif. Perceptual signature is Mara’s: coral memory, solder-lit seams, withheld data. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (“periodically eternal”) and paid off at closure. Syntax mirrors her slowed, oceanic attention.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned (heron-asleep station, solder-lit seams) and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with descent and ascent. Clean grammar; no typos. Final line recharges “periodically eternal” with earned poise.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fossil-fuel ban, coral grief, and mythic oceanic code merge into a singular vision. The folding-lane conceit is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky descent into spiral chamber pays off without gimmickry. Specificity (Kiritimati, Banaba, unsounded) anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
