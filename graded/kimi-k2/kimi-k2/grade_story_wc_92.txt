<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile attention to the quill holder and the “conspiratorial wink” of silence reveal layered motives. The final bow with glinting bronze shows earned duplicity and cost. Minor: her flaw (obedience vs rebellion) is stated more than dramatized in mid-scene beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → sigil → stair → birds → pamphlet, each step tightening her complicity. Closure is a Charged Poise: the gate “warm with borrowed fire” crystallizes irreversible complicity. Cost is legible in the single line “the lock is awake; the gate is listening.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight fort, blackout, forge vents—each detail filters through Lira’s sensorium and constrains tactics (darkness hides her, vents guide birds). The bronze holder’s shadow aligning with the sundial’s ray is a micro-setting pivot that literally changes her path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent revolution—signaled in paragraph one and escalated by each mechanical bird. One decisive tightening: releasing the first bird commits her irrevocably. Cost is the permanent duplicity she must now live; felt in her serene face as guards pass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silent subversion emerges from concrete acts (sigil, birds, pamphlet) rather than statement. Final image of the gate “listening” offers non-literal resonance: silence itself becomes insurgent. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether dawn brings victory or reprisal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“luminous fort,” “cursive fire”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during bird release. POV remains tightly anchored to Lira’s perceptions; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: she “counts the degrees between memory and desire.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conspiratorial eyebrow”) stays within Lira’s heightened register. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize the charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-keeper as clandestine cartographer, blackout as canvas, mechanical birds as pamphleteers. The half-painted sundial as code device feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric density pays off in closure image.</comment>
