<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction—relief at volunteering versus the old Mara who monetizes bread futures—grounds every beat; embodied details like inked fingers anchor her. The final renunciation feels earned by prior regret ("I volunteer to be the pressure") and visibly costs her any future monetization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration ("single diamond... inscribed") under a dominant Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds via mushroom-spore lattice teaching her bones the diamond recipe. Cost is crystallized on-page in that last gleam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The farm and elevator strata are evoked through active verbs—walls sweating, floor sticky—rather than postcard vistas. The bolt-as-key reconfigures the corridor, then itself into a diamond, constraining both journey and payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (regret into clarity) is signalled early with a single tightening beat: "reconciliation meant letting the pressure... press regret... into sharp futures." No extraneous reversals; coincidence complicates only.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the specifics—broken contracts compressed into diamond clarity—without moral tags. The echo of "pressure shared" reframes the failed pyramid with felt cost, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct syntactic glitches in the texts and sensory compression ("color of a promise") create a sonic fingerprint. The narrator’s perceptual voice stays tight inside Mara’s skepticism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</question>
<comment>Occasional abstract stacking ("concepts become physical… when thought could bruise") flirts with overwriting yet pattern-teaches the liminal hour without disrupting clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis combines ex-missile silo, fungal quantum compression, and contrite crypto-bro; none of these parts alone are new, their orchestration is. The late rule of spore lattice diamonds feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
