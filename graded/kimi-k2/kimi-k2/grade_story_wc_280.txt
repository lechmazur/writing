<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ghost’s bow-craving interiority is vivid but the only micro-choice—dancing while gathering memory-ovations—reads as external orchestration rather than character-driven. No interior contradiction or genuine flaw shapes the climax; her fusion with dust feels predetermined.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s hush becomes the preserved moment, paid for by the ghost’s dissolution. Cause is lyrical rather than causal—coincidence permitted under Accumulative lens. Timeline logic teeters between two memories but the final image makes the cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory density is lavish yet purposive; moon-petals, coin-bloom, scent of 1952 roses all braid into the closing chord. Setting as micro-cavity in tree trunk literally reassembles time—qualifies as constraint that charges closure. Occasional synesthetic overload risks overwriting but stays serviceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake “save the collapsing timeline” is clear and escalates as coin-cold deepens and single ending threatens. Tightening beats: coin exhalation → hoop rolls → tree drinks coin; cost is her erasure. Agency is poetic more than tactical; escalation still narrows to a single preserved hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme of perpetual artistic possibility emerges through image-chords rather than statement. Final preservation of “the hush before the overture” resonates without moralizing. Nostalgia is rendered tangible enough to charge closure, though lightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice sustains lush synesthetic register—cinnamon thunder, cymbal-dew—without head-hop. Pattern of lyrical elision is established early and the closing chord teaches payoff. Minor register shimmer (“time knits tight”) remains intentional under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Most sentences carry double freight; figurative density rarely stalls and imagery accrual matches closing intensification. Occasional near-echo (“stage light” used twice inside forty words) is minor and does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fusion of theater ghost, dying timeline, and orchard synesthesia feels non-derivative. Every fresh image grows from prior seed (tarot coin as spinning spotlight that casts her own performances onto apples). Risk pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
