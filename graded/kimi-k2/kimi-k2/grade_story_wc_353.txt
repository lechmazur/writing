<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“throat aches with borrowed sorrow”), but the sculptor’s contradictory impulses remain largely implied rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat; the final renunciation of force in favor of invitation is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the grove’s first returned note crystallizes stakes and cost. Orientation is immediate; no causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grove, porcelain insulator, and lichen strands function as micro-settings that constrain tactics; the insulator’s spiral cracks literally guide the final breath-note, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore birdsong—tightens through each micro-resonance gathered; the adagio’s quietness itself becomes the escalating constraint, culminating in the single siskin note that reweights all prior silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy as active listening emerges organically from action; no moralizing. The final image of glowing cracks reconfigures the premise: silence is not broken but taught to breathe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained—compressed, sensorily precise diction (“moss so thick it swallows sound”)—with no POV drift; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density; figurative language disciplined to pattern (“porcelain… crazed with hairline fractures that catch the dawn the way dew catches breath”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telegraph insulator turned resonator, hedgehog as barometer of trust, stress-cracks read as musical notation. Risky quietness pays off in earned sonic climax.</comment>
