<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—his “soundless laugh that shook his shoulders like a tambourine” shows contradiction between grief and joy. Motivation (translate silence into music) is clear and drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—walking away soaked, footprints fading—earns its cost. Only the “quietly charismatic” label is asserted rather than dramatized, a minor slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “long, low chord” reweights the premise—silence becomes music without audience. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of signing to tide, camera as tuning fork, water rising as bass note all tighten toward the final image. Cost is legible in soaked clothes and footprints that “would fade by dawn.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, pier planks, vintage camera, and rising tide are vivid, selective, and purposeful. Camera-as-metronome constrains the final gesture; water level shapes the bass-note immersion. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and shimmer, mirroring internal state. Micro-setting (camera on bollard) charges the closing silhouette. No excess; every detail earns its place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate silence into music before total anonymity. Escalation is accretive—each signed phrase tightens the cadence until the final arpeggio forecloses return. Cost is the literal submersion and the symbolic erasure of footprints. Agency remains with the composer; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art persists beyond recognition, silence is not absence but medium. Final image of the city “hum[ming] his tune without knowing why” reweights prior anonymity. Subtext in the camera’s empty chamber and the gull’s wing-beat cymbal. No moralizing; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“moonlight distills water to silver” is both sensory and metaphorical. Rhythm modulates with action: long sentences for lull, fragments for signing beats. POV stays locked; no head-hop. Compression taught early (“no one remembers you”) and paid off in final anonymity. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, musical, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—camera as tuning fork, bubbles as dotted half notes. Zero artifacts in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm supports the musical conceit without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf composer mapping silence into unheard music—is fresh and fully committed. Vintage camera with no film, invented sign language for wind and water, and joyful sorrow tone synthesize into singular vision. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; transformation is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
