<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s cool-headedness is embodied in her deliberate zigzag path and calm heartbeat; the surrender of that trait to house the goddess’s echo is dramatized through the rail-spike bargain and her final burning resonance. Interiority stays concrete—salt ache, net patience—without diagnostic labels. The cost is felt: she forfeits the very trait that defined her. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira renounces her defining coolness, the spike glows, and the sky re-settles—cost is legible in the glowing brand and her new burning gait. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern breaks and density increases until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early by the sound-garden’s sensory cues; no causality breaks. One continuous scene, single POV, within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but active constraint: every footstep becomes chord, every breath tremolo, guiding Lira’s zigzag tactics. The rail spike and iron lore function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—reed sine waves, pebble polyrhythms—filtered through Lira’s fisher priorities. Environment directly shapes the bargain and the closing hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the bargain demands her coolness. Escalation is textural: pattern breaks intensify until the spiral funnels starlight into the spike. Agency drives the final cost; coincidence merely complicates. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the surrender of control for communion: silence as feral lullaby, iron as memory, patterns as mutable grammar. Subtext lives in gesture—the spike’s glow, the tide’s harmonics—never stated. Final image of Lira “burning, a walking resonance” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the goddess’s echo is both gift and wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control—“wolf mouths snow,” “moonlit mussels”—that modulates under pressure. POV stays tight to Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is fisher-specific: herring, storm petrels, salt lungs. Experimental compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without loops. Metaphors are coherent—iron as locomotive lullaby—and never muddle causality. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final third remains clean, allowing 9-band consideration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of sound-garden physics, sleepwalking constellations, and fisher myth feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed: the rail spike is antenna, lullaby is feral, silence is voiced. Specificity—“ultraviolet yawn,” “cymbal crashes of coastal names”—anchors universals. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
