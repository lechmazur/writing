<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her “buffering” of reality and the moment she labels the wings “Post-Flood Specimen #1–12” crystallize her arc. The contradiction between her neutron-star precision and the slow erosion she witnesses is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation of loud endings carries visible cost in the sealed envelope beside the data drives. One slip: the phrase “kindled humility” edges toward label-speak mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each wing and dust pattern layers density until the gradient from vivid to ashen reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the envelope and seedlings reconfigure meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One hairline slip: the thunder promise is external coincidence, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s torn roof and pooled rain are tactile constraints—she kneels in debris, collects wings from specific benches, and the drip acts as metronome. The monarch wing and dust function as micro-setting objects that charge the final spectral map. Seedlings threading through debris evolve the space causally. No 9+ only because the storm itself remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the quiet arithmetic of decay—tightens through each wing collected; the gradient of color loss is the escalating cost. Agency is attention and renunciation: she chooses to archive rather than mourn loudly. The final envelope forecloses spectacle. Slight deduction for thunder as external intensifier rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gradual versus sudden endings emerges from the dust patterns and color gradient, never asserted. The lullaby of decay is earned through the chrysalis that never opened. Final image of seedlings threading through debris offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is neutron-star precise yet lyric: “radioactive silicates condensing into whisper-thin rings” marries physics and elegy. Perceptual signature filters every detail through her professional gaze. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the drip, longer cadences in reflection. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers information without scaffold. Metaphors are controlled—“roof beams sagged like tired shoulders” is earned, not ornamental. No loops or synonym churn. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she began to speak aloud, softly”) could tighten further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star physics as lens for butterfly extinction. The spectral-analysis app repurposed for wing dust is a non-obvious turn that feels inevitable. Specificity of “Danaus plexippus” and “photonic erosion” anchors universals. Risk in quiet closure pays off with conceptual repricing.</comment>
