<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority crystallizes under pressure; “quietly enthusiastic” re-energizes during the coin-circle moment, grounding her final decision. The coins weight = heartbeat crystallizes the felt cost of acceptance. Minor slip is the backward-prophecy echo feels briefly diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: coin-alignment rituals escalate density until the fused-coin lens births new light. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—“light she sent now would become the light that had started everything”—reweighting the cosmos with stark conceptual cost. Pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Ambered deck’s resin walls, cracked telescope lens, and fused coin-lens actively constrain choices and charge the final beam; precise sensory selection anchors the scene without exposition drift. Environment directly narrows possibilities and reweights the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—alignment before ash—never wavers; pressure tightens as Mira’s micro-adjustments of coin position re-curve possible futures. Final chord-beam visibly forecloses all other outcomes and carries a cosmic-pricetag.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts: commerce-symbols (coins) distilled into a new lens for universal rebirth. Backwards prophecy’s echo crystallizes into a non-moral, resonant image of circular creation. No final-paragraph sermonizing; resonance achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice melds cosmic lyricism with tactile precision—“resinous walls holding the last light.” Syntax modulates: compressed phrasing under action density, expanded metaphor at climactic image. Unique perceptual signature held across POV without leakage or head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm flexes—long spirals for entropy, short strikes for coin movements. No synonym loops, no scaffold. Density is high; “distill meaning from those bursts” does double duty as action and thematic cue. One minor cadence stutter early, not in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-heat-death observatory, coin-currency rebirth, reverse-temporal message. Concept risks maximal abstraction yet lands through embodied micro-choices, not gimmick. Risk fully pays off in newborn light-thread.</comment>
