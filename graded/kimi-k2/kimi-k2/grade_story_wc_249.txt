<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradictions bloom through sensory percussion (“tasted someone else’s pearl wedding” vs “keep her own name”), and her renunciation of borrowed memory-ghosts lands with visible cost—her pulse on the rail the next morning. The rebellion is quiet but embodied: every drum tap forecloses one serum slot, and the final smile is the earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant lens—Situational crystallization—holds: pressure from the ward, the garden, and the lagoon narrows choice until Elara’s finger in the gold reconfigures memory ownership with undeniable cost. Closure (Reconfiguration/CR) satisfies; only mild orientation drift on first paragraph geography prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden’s resonant flora actively constrain the drum-choices (“resonant pedals hummed”) and provide the conduit for the conceptual CPR of memory-return. Micro-setting works as both garden and memory-organ; its final hush is the only place the breath could be released intact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—resist institutional extraction and restore original memory ownership—tightens with each percussive question; gold-water re-distribution removes extraction as option. One crystallizing escalation sufficient under situational lens—yet the external threat of tomorrow’s serum could have bitten one notch harder for 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Memory ownership, collective dreaming, and ethical medicine emerge organically through the drum-dialogue with the lagoon, never stated. Final dimming ember offers resonant, non-moral answer that re-weights every echo without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person intimate glints with precise, characterological diction (“auric lagoon,” “cedar scent burned away”) and rhythmic percussion that mirrors focalizer urgency. Zero POV drift; no unmotivated lyric inflation—every cadence teaches the garden’s language and yields at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lush imagery stays precise and motive-driven—metaphors accrete weight instead of prettifying. Only near-overload in the vine’s mourning D-sharp briefly stalls breath; no artifact drags the closure beat, and sentence-level propulsion is near-virtuoso.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fusion of synaptic memory-banks with vegetal sonic garden is fresh and specific yet inevitable; experimental paradigm and lyrical execution feel non-derivative but risk-controlled. Minor withholding (exact institutional tech) keeps it 8.9 rather than 9+ pure.</comment>
