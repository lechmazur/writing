<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—trespass vs. destiny—are embodied in her micro-choices (wading, tilting the clarinet). The final renunciation of speech for a wordless note carries visible cost: she now shares breath with the ghost, foreclosing ordinary music. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “lately inspired” is asserted, not dramatized until the silence lesson.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the flood recedes, the program blanks, and Mara’s single note suspends her between silence and song. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each water-stain glyph layers pressure until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact—every ripple and droplet leads to the treble-clef door. Cost is legible in the vanished prima-donna reflection and the empty house.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The flooded opera house is no backdrop; water depth dictates movement, lantern reflections choreograph breath. The antique program, clarinet, and rising tide act as micro-settings that constrain choices. Spatial tracking is flawless—no impossible positions. One hairline slip: algae on velvet is vivid but doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode the ghost’s silence before the house claims her. Pressure tightens as water rises and lanterns dim; each glyph decoded narrows her options to perform or drown. The final performance is earned agency with felt cost—she forfeits ordinary music. No reversals needed; deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: silence as generative, the space between memory and forgetting. Subtext lives in gesture—lifting the clarinet to water instead of lips. The blank program’s single line reweights all prior glyphs without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the ghost was never trapped, yet the invitation exacted a price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, matching a musician’s perceptual bias—sound, pressure, resonance. Syntax breathes with the scene: long sentences in calm water, fragments when lanterns flare. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mara. Compression (“second heartbeat”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each image does double duty (“droplets…like suspended stars”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with stakes—accelerated clauses as water rises. One minor scaffold: “as if the house itself inhaled” could trim, but it doesn’t dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The drowned opera house as silent score is a fresh synthesis; water as solvent and quill transforms a familiar ghost trope. Risk—wordless climax via water-filled clarinet—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Every detail is irreplaceable; swap the program or flood and the logic collapses. Specificity grounds the uncanny.</comment>
