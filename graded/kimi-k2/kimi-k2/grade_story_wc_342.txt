<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira’s face-blindness, micro-choices, and embodied hesitation at the coin create an interior spiral that justifies every pigment and star; her final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible conceptual cost as the mural fractures into seeds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fractal star map, encoded coin, and destruction timeline lock together under causal pressure—each star pressed from the coin reroutes the sky and final image; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost felt at the instant the hush deepens into silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The hollowed trunk’s amber dust, copper smell, and fractal mural transform a dying library into a living organ of memory; setting constrains brushstrokes and recharges the final image when stars drift upward as pages.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure mounts from dawn deadline and claw veins tearing bark; cost is legible when the mural must be finished before collapse, forcing Lira’s limit-discovering push and the cosmos-to-dust transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theming knowledge’s endurance piggybacks on a single image—the sky mirrored in a seed of wood—delivered without preaching; final silence reweights the premise that memory outlives containers.</comment>
