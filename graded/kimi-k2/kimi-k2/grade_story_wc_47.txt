<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—public silence vs. intimate grafting—drives every beat; the micro-choice to splice the rose into the rack crystallizes her hierarchy of values (forgiveness over vindication) with visible cost (kneeling, thorns, peat). The amber pendant’s final flare is earned by prior tactile attention, not deus-ex-machina. Minor slip: “protected vulnerability” is named rather than embodied in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (drip, moss, hum) intensifies until the hologram reframes the lost conversation, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration—“forgive” in liquid morse—whose cost is the relinquishing of public reply. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Closure beat is legible, felt, and irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moss-warm rack and icicle-drip pattern are not backdrop; they constrain Lira’s grafting posture and supply the literal code that resolves the stake. Micro-setting (amber pendant as projector) charges the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to answer her brother’s viral confession—tightens once: from seeking scrubbed logs to choosing living rebuttal. The rose insertion is the single decisive act that forecloses online retaliation; cost is the thorn-scored palm and the wait for bloom. Escalation is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of mercy-through-metabolism emerges organically: data decay → chlorophyll memory. The final image (rose petal as wordless apology) offers a non-literal answer to “how to respond to public shame.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the patient drip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“honeyed hush,” “mycelial threads”) that never drifts into purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lira notices temperature, circuitry hum, salt crust—details that advance goal. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (amber ember, liquid morse). One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to twitch”) but does not stall momentum or touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cyber-ruin and living archive feels inevitable yet fresh; the grafting conceit transforms familiar grief-recovery arc into post-digital ritual. Risky lyricism pays off in the final reprojection. No derivative echoes.</comment>
