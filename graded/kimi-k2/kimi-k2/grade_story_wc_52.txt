<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the blank vs. compressing it—play out in embodied micro-choices under the kettle’s ticking clock. The final renunciation (carving becomes portable absence) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the carving is “already gone” yet pocketed. Interiority is concrete, specific, and avoids therapy-speak. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “harvested from the nights” edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of presses and absences reweights the stake until the ash holds “the precise temperature of memory.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the carving glows, is pocketed, and the loft exhales. Cost is legible in the final image—“already gone”—and the chains’ stillness. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is not backdrop; its condensation, chains, and eaves-drip constrain Mara’s tactile method and echo her interior state. Micro-setting (ash blank as “setting”) constrains the only possible action—compress, not carve. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Missing only a final constraint to push 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform inert grief into portable memory before the kettle screams. Escalation is the accelerating press-and-release rhythm that narrows options from carving to compression. Cost is the blank’s vanishing and the lions’ final departure. Agency is Mara’s alone; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tactile metaphor: love compressed, not erased. Subtext lives in gesture—thumbprints, dimples, the cooled carving. Final image reframes prior material without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity held in “hauntingly practical.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in circus diction (“old rigging chains,” “circus tea”). Perceptual signature is widow-specific: rain as slow applause, ash warming like a sleeping lion. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pattern-taught (“rain-light filled the hollows”). Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar widow-grief trope is transformed through circus specificity and the non-obvious method of compression-not-carving. Synthesis feels inevitable: the lion tamer’s secret (“never pretend they are tame”) becomes Mara’s acceptance of untamed loss. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
