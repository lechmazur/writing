<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingertips “humanize” the glass, the screw’s ridges “bloom like dried placenta.” The final micro-choice—placing the screw into the clock—earns a credible shift from sensory absence to synesthetic hearing of scent. One minor slip: the grandmother’s aphorism (“When you lose one sense…”) edges toward folklore convenience rather than lived memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s soft throb reweights Elara’s loss into a new sensory grammar. Fog thinning and light striping the floorboards provide a cadence shift that crystallizes the before/after. Cost is legible in the faint ticking she now carries—an audible scar of her renounced olfactory world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shop’s cedar ghosts and fog-pressed panes constrain Elara’s tactile reading; the copper-scarred water clock becomes micro-setting that houses the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: scent is absent, temperature and texture dominate. One hairline slip: “watercolor bruises” edges purple, but the image is brief and closure-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering a way to “read” emotion without smell—tightens when Milo asks her to feel for the fracture. The screw’s insertion is the single decisive act that forecloses reliance on fragrance; the cost is the audible ticking she must now bear. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no reversals, one deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tactile substitution of scent with pulse: “Clocks don’t measure time; they measure longing.” The final image—hearing cedar with her ribs—offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior sensory absence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the faint tick she pockets.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “the fog outside pressed against the pane, an occluded view that made the wheel look like a moon eclipsed by its own memory.” Perceptual signature is consistent—synesthetic, synecdochic, never ventriloquing Milo. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold; “rust had bloomed like dried placenta” is precise, not purple. One micro-slip: “watercolor bruises” momentarily overloads, but the cadence recovers before closure.</comment>

<comment>The olfactory-loss premise is familiar, yet the synesthetic pivot—hearing scent through a midwife’s screw inside a water clock—feels inevitable and fresh. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the final tick is both miracle and cost. No derivative echo; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
