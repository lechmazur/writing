<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s contradictory impulses—guard duty vs. memory stewardship—are embodied in micro-choices (kneeling, pacing, pinning the flower). His final renunciation of isolation is earned by the tactile cost of accepting the stranger’s grief. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: the phrase “communal burden” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s stance toward isolation crystallizes when he pins the Edelweiss to the rail and begins the journal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each observed gap thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the wilting petals and the whispered promise. Orientation is swift and functional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lantern form a micro-setting that actively constrains perception and choice; the gaps between pilings literally guide the keeper’s method. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The Edelweiss scent recharges the final image. No credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the keeper accept the transferred grief?—is signaled early and tightens through each gap counted. The deepening is driven by his agency (pouring memory into each vessel) and costs him his prior emotional insulation. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-burden emerges organically from the keeper’s embodied actions; no moralizing. The final image of the wilting Edelweiss reweights the entire pattern without a stated thesis. Subtext in the circle on his wrist and the backward-walking silhouette is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to maritime textures and alpine scent. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Purposeful elision (her face dissolves into foam) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and coherent. Minor loop risk in “softly persistent” repetition, but it serves the pattern. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The memory-transfer conceit is rendered through specific sensory and emotional detail rather than trope. The lighthouse-as-memory-warden angle feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric compression is rewarded by heightened resonance.</comment>
