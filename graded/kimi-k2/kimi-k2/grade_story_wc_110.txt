<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the registrar’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. professional reserve—play out in micro-choices (crouching, pocketing, scribbling). The final handshake is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost. Minor drift: the predecessor’s ledger confession is delivered via ticket-code rather than embodied action, slightly blunting his agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens held to the sky presents “the black sky exactly as it is,” crystallizing the new shared stance. Causal chain holds: eavesdrop → decode → reciprocal message → meeting → joint amendment. One seamless scene, anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Forecourt’s marble seams, puddles, and crystal columns are filtered through the registrar’s perceptual bias and constrain movement (crouching beneath cloisters, meeting at mirrored puddles). The lens and ledger function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Selective sensory economy supports tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust via transparency—tightens once when the decoded confession forces reciprocal honesty. Cost is felt: twenty years of falsified figures balanced in red ink, and the registrar’s own secrecy is relinquished. Agency drives escalation; coincidence only reveals, never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of honesty’s weight emerges through concrete objects (lens, ledger, tickets) and gestures rather than statement. Final image of the lens holding unfiltered moonlight offers non-literal, resonant answer: clarity itself is the earned warmth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “droplets slide like silent apologies,” “crystal whispering forecourt.” POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hop. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early (“after words become unnecessary”) and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, character, and theme. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. Occasional elevated diction (“ambiguously clear”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Final cadence slows appropriately to crystallize closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic guilt meets lyric ghost-story atmosphere. The projector lens repurposed as honesty-filter is specific and irreplaceable. Risky quiet ending lands because prior pattern earns the hush. No derivative echoes; transformation test passed.</comment>
