<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys’s interiority is rich—her chastity as “blade” and refusal to sing reveal layered motive. The final absorption of the prism is earned by prior withholding and reverence. Yet the story keeps her essentially flawless; no misstep or internal contradiction surfaces under pressure, so the arc feels slightly pre-ordained rather than risked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism seeds into her chest, reconfiguring memory’s silence into living echo. Causality holds—each untangled thread tightens stakes until the sanctuary shatters. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of light-dense images escalates to inevitable implosion with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, snow, and refracting walls are not backdrop but instruments: snow melts under released light, marble sings, walls crack along starlight seams. The prism itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; every sensory choice feeds the climactic collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices from imperial silence—is signaled early and tightened with each untwisted thread. Agency is continuous; Lys’s ceremonial untangling narrows options until the only path is release. Cost is palpable: sanctuary destroyed, her body now vessel for thousand screams.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image and action: silence weaponized becomes scream, memory as insurgency. No moralizing; the prism’s implantation is a non-literal answer that reweights the empire’s lullaby. Subtext of chastity-as-resistance threads through sensory choices without ever naming the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “snow fell in slow, deliberate flakes” teaches cadence early and sustains it. Perceptual signature—light as bodily inscription, absence as tongue—remains character-bound. No head-hopping; compression and elision are patterned and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“shards of glass,” “lattice of crystal and silence”—and avoid purple overload. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into the shatter without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of harvesting echoes into starlight threads is fresh; familiar rebellion trope is re-angled through sensory alchemy. Risky lyric structure pays off in a single crystallized image. Specificity of “chaste courtesan” and “prism sanctuary” makes the synthesis feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
