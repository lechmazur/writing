<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt, embodied in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, sifting, digging, replacing the hand), drives every beat; her renunciation of silence in the final paragraph is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the public tear of her notebook page into the sea.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page as a crystallized Charged Poise: fitting the salvaged watch hand restarts forward time and Mara explicitly chooses voice over silence, foreclosing her counterfeit practice. The causal chain—from driftwood → watch hand → mother’s initials → photograph’s message → physical reassembly—narrows without loopholes and leaves a felt loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The reclaimed terrace, driftwood carvings, wet sand, and corroded tin box all act as micro-settings that constrain search and reveal; the cobalt dusk and ocean fog are woven into the body’s chill and the final star’s question, making the environment active in discovery rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>One rising pressure line: need for authenticity versus manufactured guilt. The decisive deepening—the photograph’s handwritten imperative—“tell her the truth weighs less than silence”—reconfigures stakes; Mara’s choice removes any future market for false lineages with public cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The theme of erasure vs record emerges from objects (watch hand, scorched driftwood, blank certificates) rather than statement; final paper-boat image reweights earlier erasure into active testimony without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, slightly compressed free indirect style remains tightly focalized; vocabulary (“sieved hush”, “manufactured memories”) is specific to a narrator haunted by precision in forgery, never drifting outside POV lexicon; cadence modulates with surf-like ebb for breathless beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Elegant texture without density bloat; metaphors (time as ribbon) are purposeful, never clotted; one sentence-level loop—“sieved hush” appears twice, first literal, second charged—earned by echo, does not dull final propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Forged lineage vendor confronting her own erased lineage is a fresh nontemplate inversion; driftwood-as-archive and watch hand revival are specific to this world; minor proximity to “objects holding memory” trope acknowledged but transformed by concrete stakes.</comment>
