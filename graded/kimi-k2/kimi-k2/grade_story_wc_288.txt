<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her aching joints, the taste of ozone, the copper-rain chord—yet the final leap off the balcony feels slightly under-motivated; the brass whale’s promise of “possible futures” is abstract, not a concrete cost that forces the choice. Still, her contradictory impulses (cling to memory vs. release it) play out in scene, and the renunciation of the library is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira steps off the balcony into an unwritten world, the cloak of mirrors humming the stone circle’s frequency—cost is the forfeiture of archival safety. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of isolation → seed → door, with each image (sundial, circle, whale, cloak) deepening the cadence until the final descent reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal library, stone circle, and brass whale are not backdrop but instruments: the circle measures loneliness, the whale becomes lantern and cloak, the library’s shelves “breathe with the tide.” These micro-settings constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened once: the stone circle’s hum forces Mira to choose between remaining a memory or becoming the echo that sings alone. The cost is the library’s closure behind her; escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: isolation as seed, not prison. The final image—mirror-scales sketching paths across the blank map—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the shift from “alone” to “all one” is earned through embodied experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to light, salt, and frequency. Compression (“brittle, every joint aching”) and patterned elision (“the echo of wings that were never hers”) are taught early and paid off in the cloak’s song. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Mira.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“moonlight like spilled salt,” “warm snow”). The final descent is rendered with syntactic breath that matches the feather-tide motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>The cloud-whale librarian who translates finished lives into new alphabets is a fresh synthesis; the brass whale’s metamorphosis from timepiece to lantern to cloak feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in the quiet, lyric closure pays off by reconfiguring meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
