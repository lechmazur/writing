<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The herder’s grief-propelled quest is vivid and embodied; the micro-choice to shift the stone sequence crystallizes interior contradiction. Yet the mother-vision functions more as oracle than relationship crucible, so the relational pressure feels one-sided. Still, the final endurance—scattering the rocks while cradling the jar—pays the visible cost the arc demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the spiral’s completion reconfigures the curse from passive sight to active stewardship, cost paid in the jar’s weight and the mother’s permanent absence. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stone placement thickens pattern density until the surf freezes and the star-dust is caught. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words and serve the final image, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless surf are not backdrop but instruments: the absent friction lets rocks slide into perfect logarithmic form and allows the surf to pause mid-break, directly enabling the climax. Star-dust as micro-setting constrains the final choice—its warmth against the chest is the felt cost. Every sensory pick is filtered through the herder’s pattern-seeking eye, so environment and body merge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the stars from falling”—tightens when the tired star’s dust must be caught before it collapses. The protagonist’s agency is the stone-shift that stabilizes the vision; failure would scatter the promise and the star. Cost is legible in the jar’s weight and the mother’s final fade. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it delivers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: patterns as both promise and burden. The ending’s image of galaxies orbiting inside seawater reweights the premise—understanding is not control but caretaking—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the stars truly rest, or does the cycle merely renew? The refusal to declare victory gives the resonance weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—mathematical, tidal, grief-etched. Rhythm modulates from long auroral sentences to the staccato “heart ticking like a metronome” under pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early (“borrowed dawn”) and paid off in the final dimming. The diction stays within the herder’s plausible lexicon while reaching for cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion (“dust heavier than memory yet lighter than breath”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors remain coherent within the frictionless physics. A single clause—“surf hissed without resistance”—does triple sensory and world-rule work. Minor risk of purple in “inside of a shell,” but the beat is low-pressure and the image is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of eel herder, star-curse, and post-friction shoreline feels inevitable yet wholly new. Mathematical stone-placement as spell-casting reweights familiar ritual into fresh logic. The tired star’s dust caught in seawater galaxies is an image not seen before, yet it grows from every prior particular. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in a closure that could not exist without these exact elements.</comment>
