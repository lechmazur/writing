<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “chronically curious” trait drives every micro-choice, from prying shards to pressing the scarred mushroom. The contradiction between her hunger for knowledge and the cost of lost years is embodied, not labeled. The final renunciation—leaving the shard—earns its poignancy because we have felt the weight of the returned years settle “heavier now.” Only the mother’s voice remains slightly abstract, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky reassembles, years return, and Elara walks away humming, the cost of curiosity now literal in her heavier bones. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard adds density until the final cadence shift. Causality is tight: the lullaby loosens the root because the mushroom is the ledger. One hairline slip: the “broken heart” shard’s resistance is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but agent: its cider breath, shipwreck ribs, and glowing mushroom constrain every move. The salt roses and tidal mud are filtered through Elara’s folklorist eye, guiding her fingers to the scar. The final image—drowned trunks like “another wreck”—recharges the setting with new meaning. Micro-setting (the mushroom’s hollow root) literally siphons her years, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens when the ledger-mushroom reveals each ring as a decade owed. Escalation is one deepening: shards flare, sky reassembles, years return with “crisp nostalgia.” The cost is visible in her heavier gait and the shard left behind. Agency is hers: she sings the lullaby that loosens the root.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transaction: folklore exacts debts, curiosity is currency. The final image—apple that “finally learned how to rot”—reweights the promise of endless harvest without moralizing. Subtext hums in the lullaby’s echo and the shard left as payment. Complexity lingers: some debts are paid in wonder, not coin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, salted with sensory specificity (“cider pressed in 1973,” “driftwood pipe still warm”). Syntax mirrors Elara’s curiosity—long, winding sentences that tighten into short, cracked notes under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is hers alone. Compression (“chronically curious”) is taught early and paid off in the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“iron ribs entwined with salt roses and the ribs of three shipwrecks”). Rhythm accelerates during the shard-flare climax, then exhales into the final walk. One minor loop: “ribs” twice in the opening sentence, but the metaphorical layering justifies it. No figurative muddle at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—memory-for-apple immortality traded in a sunken greenhouse—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Shipwrecks grafted to iron ribs, constellation shards as frozen sky: these are not quirky ornaments but integral mechanics. The final inversion—rot as grace—transforms the trope of eternal harvest. Risky lyric density pays off in resonance.</comment>
