<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sentimentalist’s grief is embodied in luminous, tactile detail; her micro-choice to leave the gear behind crystallizes a costly renunciation. Interior contradiction—yearning to break the cycle yet fearing the loss of lineage—surfaces in the sync of heart and gear. The final dispersal into photons feels earned by the prior pattern of generational burning. Only the ancestors’ brief apparitions lack individuated pressure, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear’s stillness and the protagonist’s dispersal reweight the inherited pattern with visible conceptual cost—“light can be inherited without being ignited.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each petal and ancestral echo layers density until the final hush. No orientation drift; nebula, gear, and song are anchored early. A hairline slip: the causal link between song and gear-stop is implied more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The nebula garden is no backdrop; drifting petals shape transit routes and mirror the protagonist’s internal drift. The gear’s micro-setting—half-buried in stardust, cradled on plasma moss—constrains every handling beat. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “violet and rose and bruise-blue” read as emotional weather. The final mirror-circle of teeth reflects the nebula’s hue, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the generational burn—signals early and tightens through each ancestral flare. The meaningful turn arrives when the sentimentalist sets the gear down, renouncing possession to foreclose the cycle; cost is the dispersal of self into light. Pressure accumulates via ancestral apparitions and gear acceleration, all under the Accumulative lens. One minor slack: the song’s pacifying effect feels slightly external rather than agentive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete image of a gear that learns to stop; no moralizing intrudes. Subtext lives in the gear’s scratches—each a century of fire—reweighted when the teeth form a perfect circle of reflection. The final equation, grief ÷ shared light ≈ infinity, offers a resonant non-literal answer without sermon. Complexity is preserved: the ancestors are neither forgiven nor condemned, merely folded into the drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, its lyric cadence taught in the opening line and sustained to the last “quiet sigh.” Perceptual signature is coherent light and sonar pinging—metaphors consistent with the POV’s non-corporeal stance. No head-hopping; the camera never leaves the sentimentalist’s luminous sensorium. Occasional elevated diction (“approximating infinity”) is earned by the speculative frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Rhythm modulates—from the staccato of “tiny, futile clicks” to the legato of the final dispersal—mirroring the gear’s slowing. Metaphors are coherent: petals, sonar, and fire form a closed set. One micro-loop—“petals… petals”—is forgiven for its thematic echo at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of generational trauma, cosmic setting, and mechanical metaphor feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk-taking—non-corporeal POV, lyric accumulative structure—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The gear as both calculator and heartbeat is a specific, non-obvious object that could not be swapped. Final reconfiguration of “light without fire” reframes prior SF tropes into intimate family myth.</comment>
