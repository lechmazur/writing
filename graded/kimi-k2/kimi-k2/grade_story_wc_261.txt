<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the shard yet seeking release—are embodied in the act of re-cutting her own scar; the cost is the final silence of the plants, a felt forfeiture of her lifelong telepathy. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The closure choice is earned by the entire 23-year accumulation of guilt and plant-murmured memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the upward-falling grain dissolves the hourglass’s hold, and the tower’s tunnel closes with the plants’ collective exhale. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (ivy, coffee rings, meteor hush) tightens until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the sudden absence of green voices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower, ivy, and even the coffee mug function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply memory; the eastern balcony at dawn becomes the charged site where the final act must occur. Specificity is selective—iodine taste, frosted shard, linen bandage—never touristic. The environment evolves with the action: ivy loosens only after the miracle is released.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free her brother’s trapped moment or remain a living reliquary—is signaled in the second paragraph. Escalation is a single, deepening accretion of sensory memory until the only remaining option is to re-open the wound. The cost is the irreversible loss of plant communion, paid on the final page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: time displaced, guilt crystallized, and the price of returning a miracle. The final image of the empty dish filling with dawn light offers a non-literal answer—acceptance is the scar that no longer bleeds stories. No moralizing; the ambiguity of silence lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to vegetal whispers and surgical detail. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences early, then short, decisive clauses at the climax. No head-hopping; the single POV remains coherent and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (e.g., “meteor hush” compresses sky, silence, and scalpel). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates into the final upward-falling grain, then settles into the soft ticking of a new day.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of plant telepathy, surgical extraction of time, and coffee-ring divination feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric structure pays off: the displaced miracle is not explained but enacted. The premise could not survive a simple swap of names or places.</comment>
