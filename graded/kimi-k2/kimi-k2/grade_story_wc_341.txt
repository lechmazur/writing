<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—guilt for Dr. Vasquez threads every cloud choice, and her final embrace of mnemonic weather-logging is earned; flaw, motive and on-page cost coalesce. Minor therapy-speak once (“carry the weight of grief”) stops short of 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the sky itself becomes memory archive, visible cost as dawn charges final image. Causal Accumulative lens holds; drift without anchor tightens once, no causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The brass telescope and cumulus clouds are treated as active memory mediums; every description constrains Mira’s taxonomy work. Final altostratus echo reshapes meaning, meeting the 9- environment/tool gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving atmosphere remembers—tightens through iterative cloud readings, cost legible as dawn seals her atlas. One decisive intensification meets Causal lens escalation requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Empty spaces remember” emerges from specific catalogued clouds and crystallizes in final orbital reflection; no moralizing, pure reconfiguration. Charged poise earns resonance beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is concrete—meteorologist filter, cyclone-mimic rhythm. Purposeful compression (“spooled wholeness”) is taught early and drives closure; no convergence leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dense yet propulsive; occasional lyrical flourish is pattern-taught. No loops, one filter-stack in grief storm (-0.3), easily capped within high band.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: weather memory as archive is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Brass telescope motif constrains final taxonomy choice, cementing originality.</comment>
