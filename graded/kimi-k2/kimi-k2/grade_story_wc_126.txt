<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is sensorially rich and embodied; the violinist’s contradictory impulses—renouncing music yet conducting silence—play out in real time. The final choice to return nightly as listener is earned by the causal chain of giving voice to the greenhouse. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her bow and the hush that now “follows her like a well-trained echo.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each story fragment layers density until the greenhouse itself begins to “breathe.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the violinist walks away lighter, yet the hush carries her story forward, reconfiguring silence from void to active listener. The cost is the permanent shift from performer to midwife of sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the charred canopy drips in waltz time, shipwreck ribs become bass lines. Micro-setting (the copper bowl) constrains the final choice by catching the first seed. Spatial choreography is exact—three-foot sink, soot-filmed panes—anchoring every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in the unfinished—tightens as each spoken story reweights silence from enemy to collaborator. One decisive deepening: the greenhouse begins to “sing,” foreclosing the option of leaving. Cost is visible when she lays the violin in the bowl, forfeiting her former identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: creation is collaborative listening. Subtext lives in gesture—the bow becomes conductor’s wand, the bowl becomes cradle. Final image of the shoot in the bowl offers non-literal answer: unfinished beauty is a living contract between teller and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, every clause tuned to acoustic perception: “magnificent simplicity of truth,” “chronic hush pressed…with the weight of drowned bells.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustains through final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught early (“echo-harbor,” “chronic hush”) and paid off. No loops or scaffold. Each sentence advances image or stakes; final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses post-apocalyptic greenhouse, shipwreck orchard, and acoustic curse into an inevitable whole. Risky choice to make silence the antagonist and the student pays off. Transformation test: story collapses if any named element is swapped.</comment>
