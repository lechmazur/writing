<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction—wanting to save yet forced to erase—drives every beat; the climactic self-emptying (“pane dissolved into her bloodstream”) costs her voice and future agency, grounding the lyrical arc in embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure holds as Earned Stasis: she forecloses time-meddling, bears the lullaby inside her body, and the lighthouse dims—the mirrors’ fracture is the visible price. No orientation drift; the descent-down-inward structure is motif-taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The spiral stairs, pane, and ticking gear constrain every move; the final image of salt-seeded clocks makes environment charge closure. Micro-setting (pedestal of salt and shadow) steers the choice to plant a world-seed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—world’s last breath versus preserved lives—tightens once when she chooses renunciation (vouchsafing the lullaby, surrendering the pane). Internal and universal stakes interlock; cost is on-page silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of endings as tenderness emerges from iterated images of lullabies, salt, fracture-as-doorway. No overt moralizing; final laughter that “should never have been born” reconfigures meaning without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is pattern-taught, perceptual signature consistent—“bruised awe,” “hush of time’s final ripple”—and paid off in closure. No head-hop or register drift; syntax flexes to emotional tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm controlled; figurative density purposeful. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cradle of her whispered thousand lifetimes”) tip toward purple, but momentum is not broken and image retains clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Doomsday clock adjuster as tender lullaby-carrier is fresh synthesis; the inversion of downward lighthouse, time pruned to outlive stars, re-visions familiar apocalypse as lullaby-gift. Risky choices cohere without obscurity.</comment>
