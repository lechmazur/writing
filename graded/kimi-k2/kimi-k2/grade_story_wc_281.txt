<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s affectionate skepticism is visible throughout, though it leans more to affection after the shock. Her micro-choice to follow the warmth southward feels earned and stakes out her arc.</question>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Static-lapse inciting moment drives all causality; corridor and mirrored-water events are logical consequences under situational pressure. Final image (child waving, light mote) lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The laser-etched fiber vines and mirrored water anchor every spatial beat; muscovite’s return in child’s palm constrains the ending. No white-room lapses.</question>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Static-shock kicks off one escalating agenda: trace warmth → paint seam → fold space → confront child self. Closure leap (renouncing/narrowing path) shows earned stasis with emotional price.</question>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (illuminate hidden pathways vs scarcity masquerading as safety) is enacted, not abstracted. Child’s sigil reconfigures premise without preaching; ambiguity lingers around co-opted recall.</question>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct interior filter—scientific precision, bodily skeptic, synesthetic memory—remains consistent; lyric compression in climax is controlled and audible. Voice modulates under pressure without collapsing.</question>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is tight, figurative language purposeful (“willowglass” shrinks to crystal). One near-loop (“light leaked into shadow”) forgiven since it charges payoff.</question>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Paints-with-a-forbidden-pill premise and sensory-seam folding feel inevitable and fresh; muscovite-as-mirror reprise heightens cohesion without gimmickry. Combines lyric and causal in single stroke.</question>
