<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breath frosting, ribs pressed by silence—yet her contradictory impulse (absorbing grief vs. releasing it) is dramatized only in the final third. The earned renunciation of carrying new silences is credible, but the micro-choice hierarchy could be sharper earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the net’s lacework of absences and Lira’s lighter mask crystallize the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each knot’s release deepens the pattern of silence reclaimed—without causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary’s faceted ceiling and salt-crusted net function as micro-setting that constrains every move; starlight shards sketch drowned faces, charging the final image when spirits rise through the same ceiling. Spatial choreography is clean and sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the drowned names—tightens through each unravelled knot; the final exhalation of ordinary night sounds marks the decisive shift. Cost is visible in the emptied net and Lira’s lighter yet still burdened stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both wound and thread emerges organically from the act of unpicking knots; no moralizing, only the resonant image of the mask “stitched together with threads of silence set free.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“salt crust bite her palms,” “silver scales” of silence—maintaining perceptual signature under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Lira’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. One mixed metaphor (“doorway needed a threshold of truth”) is minor; rhythm accelerates with knot releases and breathes at closure.</comment>

<comment>Fisherman-spirit net-unraveling as ritual of naming the drowned feels fresh; the broken-mask restorer trope is transformed through tactile specificity and earned cost. Final reprise of the mask gleaming whole is inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
