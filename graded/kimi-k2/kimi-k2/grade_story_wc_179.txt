<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory pacifist/schemer identity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing pin to sternum, touching stone) and her final renunciation carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, but the shift from “scheme” to “listening” is slightly compressed; more friction on the page would push this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pin becomes a seed, the battlefield a garden, and the anthem is silenced not by sabotage but by forgiveness. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each return of the pin reweights meaning. Cost is legible in Lira’s aging and final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s velvet-lung walls and cooled-ash stone constrain every action; the pin itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean; the garden’s emergence from frozen soldiers is causally tied to Lira’s touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“silence the echo of drums”—is signaled early and tightened when Lira chooses to plant the pin instead of using it. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; each iteration of the lullaby deepens cost. The price is her lifetime and the soldiers’ frozen moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: violence’s echo is undone not by erasing memory but by teaching cells to forgive. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; the final image of rifles as trellises reweights the premise without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the seed humming lullabies to bones.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“shifting grace,” “cellular memory”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is distinct—Lira notices ash-cool stone and silent pulses. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—compression under pressure, elongation in reflection. Minor risk of overwriting in “velvet lungs” but it serves tone.</comment>

<comment>Premise—pacifist steals war relic to silence drums—feels fresh; transformation into seed that teaches bones to forgive is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity anchors universals; no stock pacifist tropes. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
