<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurele’s interiority—stone nerves threaded with private fears—embodies contradiction; the telepathy that once promised certainty now demands mercy. The micro-choice to thread foxglove memory into its own fracture shows a visible cost: bronze warms, stone bleeds color, and the statue’s prior rigidity is renounced. Motivation is rooted in the flaw that rigidity wounds; the final stance crystallizes with felt price. Only the absence of a second on-page figure keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue stands, veins glowing foxglove, and the garden reseeds itself with shared memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each revelation layers density until the final image reweights the premise that “certainty must admit it was incomplete.” Cost is legible in the bronze tear refracted by the emptied ampoule. No causality breaks; orientation is taught early through coral beds and cracked dome.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned garden is not backdrop but active pressure: kelp tendrils carry memory, tiles fall to reseed octopus dreams. Micro-setting—the statue’s own cracked wrist—functions as setting when it becomes the locus of repair. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “bronze irises flecked with calcified algae” grounds both sight and history. One step short of 9.0 only because the city’s crest tile could be slightly more integrated into earlier beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the garden’s hope be rekindled—tightens when the ampoule knocks and Aurele chooses to weave memory into its fracture. Escalation is Accumulative: each revelation (garden as will, gardener’s intent, bronze tear) deepens the cost of welcoming nuance. Agency is statue-driven; coincidence complicates (tile falls) but does not resolve. The final image forecloses the path of eternal stillness with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: mercy is structural, kindness is incisive enough to cut rot yet spare new growth. Subtext lives in gesture—threading filament through stone—and in the final silent invitation. The foxglove motif reweights from poison to pulse, charging the closure. No moralizing; the ending’s prismatic tear offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “incisively kind” compresses paradox; “animate lifeless” modulates from chill to warmth. Syntax mirrors tectonic slowness—“motion too slow for eyes of fish”—then breathes open with “petals burst open in reverse motion.” No head-hopping; POV remains statue-bound. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “stone palms open above coral beds” fuses setting and metaphor in one stroke. Occasional elevated diction (“astrolabes of lives”) is voice-motivated. One minor filter-verb cluster near the middle keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—telepathic statue tending memory-garden—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of guardian and ruin are transformed through embodied mercy and botanical memory. The synthesis of foxglove, fracture-threading, and prismatic tear is non-obvious and risk-heightened. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
