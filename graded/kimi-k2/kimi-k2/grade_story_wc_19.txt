<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for open sky yet clinging to bunker identity—are embodied in the porcelain doll and the tasting of silences; her final teaching moment with her father crystallizes a credible shift from isolation to shared hush, the cost being the permanent surrender of the doll/second heart.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each silence sampled layers density until the final bridge image reweights the premise; causality holds via gravity inversion as taught constraint, and the porcelain archway closure carries unmistakable conceptual cost—no drills, no hiding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The xenial trellis above clouds, the porcelain doll, and the inverted bunker corridors are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Lira’s choices (limited exposure timing, anchor point for return) and charges the final bridge image; spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting/experiencing silences vs. bunker survival—tightens when Lira must choose to leave the rooted doll as anchor; the hourglass of inversion forces each taste to matter, and the final muting of the siren shows escalating agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both refuge and generative space emerges organically from Lira’s sensory choices and the father’s eventual apprenticeship; the porcelain bridge offers a resonant, non-literal answer—silence cultivated becomes a shared path rather than solitary escape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—tasting silence, feeling lattice hum as “polite throat clearing”—is consistent and lyrically compressed; patterned elision (gravity inversion rule taught early) pays off at closure; no head-hopping, diction stays within child-bunker lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“roots of quiet,” “porcelain archway”) is purposeful and never muddles causality; no loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional beats; final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity inversion as temporal window, silence as literal taste, porcelain doll as bridge—none feel gimmicky; the transformation of bunker builder into “gardener of hush” is earned and specific; risk-taking heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
