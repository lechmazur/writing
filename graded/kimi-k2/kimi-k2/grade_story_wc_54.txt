<comment>Mara’s curiosity and functional-creative nature are repeatedly enacted—kneeling to feel vibration, aligning sextant fragments, sketching star-chart schematics. Motivation scales believably as each rerouting act costs physical stamina and widens emotional orbit. Interiority is specific and embodied, e.g., “felt the old instrument remember voyages it never took.” Final renunciation of recovered terminal as a static memorial carries earned cost under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the abandoned terminal “breathes,” its status rewritten from entropy to living archive. Progression accrues image after image—“higher flower as brass bloom”—culminating in a final cadence that reweights loss into possibility because/therefore linkage held throughout. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Environment is precisely deployed: “shuttered gift shops and empty security lanes” physically narrow options while bioluminescent vines later provide working light. Abandoned-spaceport macro setting plus sextant/tool micro setting both constrain choices and charge the final garden tableau. Strong POV-filtered sensory triage keeps spatial anchors clear.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (restore abandoned space) signaled immediately; intensifies through cascading micro-decisions—each rerouting lowers remaining battery charge and escalates fatigue—until final image crystallizes irrevocable shift. Agency remains primary; no coincidences resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The core theme—hope as a vector that reroutes loss—arises organically from the physical resurrection action. Final “vector equation” is never spoken but legible in the living vines. Absence of moralizing keeps ambiguity intact; emotional resonance carried by tactile particulars.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>POV is single, lyrically compressed, but pattern taught in first paragraph and honored at close. Syntax contracts or expands to match exertion—“lights flickered on, not bright, but enough.” Perceptual signature is distinctive: notice how Mara reads vibrations through her palm and translates geometry into emotion. No filter-verb drift or head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never overwritten; every line performs two jobs: “starlight pooled like spilled sugar” anchors both setting and Mara’s childlike wonder. Minimal scaffold, no paraphrase loops. One near-redundant “resonant reprise” sentence is brief and pattern-justified, so no penalty at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival residue, civil-engineer epistemology, and dying spaceport achieves unclichéd lyric reclamation. The “garden in a departure lounge” would feel gimmickry if not for relentless specificity of rerouted coolant lines and memory water. Final transformation feels inevitable yet original under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
