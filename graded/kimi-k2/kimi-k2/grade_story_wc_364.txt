<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s interior contradiction—clinging to grief yet forging lattices—drives every beat; the memory-for-strength trade is embodied in the wrist-tightening silk and the hollow after the azure exchange. Her quiet determination is dramatized, not labeled, when she lights the cold forge. The final recognition that memory is “alloyed, not erased” lands as earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silk’s colorless weave into leaves crystallizes the cost of memory alloyed into resilience. Causal chain holds—each hammer blow follows from the crystal-silk exchange—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost is legible in the hollowness Elowen feels and the brother’s leaf-borne voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The floating rock arches and azure crystal seams are not backdrop; they constrain tactics—crystal source, lattice transport on cart rails—and charge the final image when azure threads climb bark. Sensory selection is urgent: “gravel like old bones,” “water tasted of storms.” Setting evolves with stakes: failing orchards → luminous fruit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the orchards by trading memories—is signaled early and tightened once: the first exchange hollows Elowen, the villagers’ demand escalates cost. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues. Each lattice exacts a visible price, foreclosing the path of painless salvation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s transmutation into living resilience emerges through concrete particulars—silk, crystal, lattice—never stated. Final image of colorless silk in golden leaves offers non-literal answer: what is given away returns transformed. Moral ambiguity preserved; no tidy maxim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “sky of floating rock arches,” “forge smoke” soft as memory. Syntax mirrors Elowen’s hush and surge: long cadences for grief, staccato hammer beats for resolve. No head-hop; POV stays interior and embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“slag in her chest,” “dawn in reverse.” Rhythm accelerates during forging, breathes during twilight walks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Memory-as-currency grafted onto orchard-planet fantasy feels inevitable, not gimmick. Tropes—grief, renewal—are re-forged through blacksmith craft and planetary physics. Specificity of azure crystal and floating arches anchors universals. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure.</comment>
