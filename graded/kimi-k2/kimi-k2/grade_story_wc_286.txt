<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kiran’s interiority is embodied and specific—his palms open to the thrum, his choice to weight the blooming footstep—but the final renunciation (“continuous, careful turning”) is more asserted than dramatized with visible cost. The contradiction between stillness and motion is present yet not fully mined for tension. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern glass unfolds into petal-light mapping every bee-return, reweighting the premise that kindness selects which layer surfaces. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift rather than causal chain—and the cost is legible in the dimming/brightening of the ember tied to attention. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned oasis is rendered through tactile micro-setting—cracked hives, lavender scent, ash rope—each detail constraining Kiran’s footstep choice. The lantern glass itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why some places resist change”—is signaled early and tightened through the footstep choice: blooming vs. char. The phototropic ember’s dimming/brightening makes the cost of attention visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the layered timelines and the final image of continuous turning; no moralizing. The closing “potter’s glaze of memory and mercy” reweights prior material without statement. Subtext operates in the lantern’s phototropic leaning and the unspoken cost of choosing bloom over char.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control under pressure: “timelines folded into the present moment, no longer fractured but layered.” Perceptual signature is distinct—potter’s vocabulary, zen cadence—and consistent. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is patterned and paid off—lantern petals, wax ghosts—without overwriting. Final third remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of beekeeping apocalypse, zen pottery, and fractal timelines feels inevitable in hindsight. The phototropic kindness ember is a fresh inflection that reconfigures the moral calculus. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
