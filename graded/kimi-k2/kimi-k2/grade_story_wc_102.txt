<question>1</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction between pilgrim-self and present artist is vivid; the final breath-transformation is earned by prior micro-choices (touching image, accepting mist). Embodied emotion arcs from tremble to flood of warmth without epiphany drift. One minor slip: “unused love” risks label-speak, but the bowl/wound image recovers with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens held throughout: each inhale/exhale and jasmine pulse tightens the resonant reconfiguration. Closure is the Earned Stasis of integrated selves—pilgrim and artist occupy same breath—with conceptual cost visible in the cracked bowl now sealed by liquid light. Causality is breath-driven rather than external-plot, fitting lens.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Setting is twilight viaduct + jasmine bloom + camera apparatus; each constrains tactics (lens angle, scent intensity, reflective surfaces). Micro-setting camera obscura functions as tool that forces choice: reach through velvet hood. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (parapet, river below) held steady. One minor drift: “stone softened by jasmine” teeters toward personification cliché, but not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: locate and heal unused love. Pressure escalates via breath-linked images; each exhale narrows until pilgrim turns and bowl fills, foreclosing search for external source. Credible on-page reversals (mist re-enters lungs, bowl reseals). Cost is felt in final clarity that “unused love waits only for breath” rather than an object—a tightening of scope.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-reconciliation emerging from concrete particulars—cracked bowl, tear mist, jasmine sparks—without moral pronouncement. Final image reweights premise: healing not erasure but revelation. No late explicit thesis; resonance operates subtextually. One nudge down for therapeutic label “wound shaped like empty bowl,” forgiven by embodied action.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, heightened third-person anchored in Mei-Ling’s sensate attention; syntax ripples with breathing cadence—long exhalations mirrored in extended clauses. All perceptions filtered through camera lens bias. No head-hopping or POV drift. Diction stays within mystical artist lexicon with occasional elevated flourish justified by reverie.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Most sentences do triple duty (exhalation = action + image + theme). Occasional purple stretch (“fragrance thick as regret”) but justified by heightened reality. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm in final paragraph (“lift…flow…flood”) mirrors breath-work excellently. One near-repetition “breathe…exhale” pattern flagged, but accelerates to closure rather than dragging.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera-obscura spiritual time-bridge + kwan yin tear + metabolic transmutation of grief into light. Familiar tropes (jasmine fog, pilgrim past-life) feel particularized through apparatus POV. Conceptual risk pays off in closure without gimmickry.</comment>
