<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; synesthetic perception drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation—releasing her guarded silence—carries a felt cost that forecloses her path. Motivation (“to certify wonder as essential”) is dramatized through tactile action rather than stated. No secondary character applies pressure, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s silent oscillation reweights the premise that wonder can exist without noise. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each color-chord accumulation tightens awe until the marble yields. Orientation is anchored early; no disorientation serves closure. Cost is legible in the blank amber sheet she carries away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern, aurora, and marble block constrain every choice; the marble literally reshapes under her touch, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (cedar, lullaby, first snow). Environment evolves causally with events; no static repetition. Micro-setting (prism-song bells on her wrists) functions as tool and constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and tightened through escalating color-chord density. The decisive turn is her final unfettering of silence, which forces the marble to become the bell; cost is the blanking of her amber sheet. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder does not need volume to be real. Subtext operates in gesture—the sculptor kneels in silence. Final image (bell glowing with trapped aurora) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstraction intrudes; complexity is held in the charged silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is unmistakable (“tasted the hush before she heard it”). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity. No dialogue, so no register clash. POV modesty maintained—no knowledge leaps. Purposeful compression (“oscillating repose”) teaches its pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and taught early (“paper bird,” “liquid glass”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor risk of overwriting in “fractal cathedrals,” but momentum sustains. Closure image is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—synesthetic bell ringer sculpting silence into a bell—feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation of marble via aurora-colors is non-obvious yet earned. Risk-taking (lyric, synesthetic mode) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
