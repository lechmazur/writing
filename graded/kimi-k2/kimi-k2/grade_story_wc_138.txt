<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s boredom-to-renunciation arc is embodied in micro-choices (palm on wall, tracing fields, stepping onto prism). The final turn—choosing to turn back after seeing every goodbye—earns its cost through prior causal beats and the charged image of lanterns dimming. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “bored beyond the reach of words” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied rest compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Veyra’s stance toward eternity crystallizes with visible cost (lanterns dim, dust in hair). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of color, storm, and memory layers until the final image reweights the stake. No orientation debt; spatial anchors taught early. Causality intact: shard tug → prism → fusion → hallway → choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite is no backdrop; its magnetic lattice and collapsing corridors actively constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection narrows under crisis (colors shiver, corridors invert). Micro-setting—the shard lodged in the wall—functions as setting-object that alters choice. One vivid, purposeful detail per beat; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened once: the shard’s promise vs. pocket-dimension integrity. Escalation is accumulative: storm surge, color chaos, spatial mutiny, lantern hallway. Cost is legible on the page (eternity now threaded with every farewell). No coincidence resolves; Veyra’s agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between endless time and finite memory. The lantern hallway offers a non-literal answer: after goodbye is everything remembered at once. No moralizing; resonance arises from the specific image of reversed-snow dust glittering in her hair. Subtext in the shard’s “mutiny” and the storm’s “approval” deepens without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“drum inside a drum”). Perceptual signature is Veyra’s: dimensionally aware, star-tasting, eternity-weary. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight. Compression taught early (“folded space… silence pressed like velvet”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“lanterns hung in the void,” “reversed snow”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor flourish—“hushed thunder”—is earned by pattern and closure payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: immortal ennui meets pocket-dimension physics meets memory-as-lanterns. Tropes (cursed amulet, immortal boredom) are transformed through specific sensory logic and emotional cost. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under the Accumulative lens. Final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
