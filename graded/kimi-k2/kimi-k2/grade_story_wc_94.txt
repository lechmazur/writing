<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“furiously tranquil” hands, scars on palms), but the poet’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Micro-choices (slipping fragment into developer, pressing it to lens) are present yet lack visible cost until the last beat. Still, the character’s refusal to finish the vigil until the storm completes the circuit earns a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the poem projected onto stormclouds reweights every prior scar and redaction. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragment’s rarefaction layers density until the final image explodes the stakes. Orientation is immediate; the observatory and storm are anchored by line 3. The timer running backward is a taught pattern that pays off in the sigh-like ring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, glass dome, and darkroom tools are tactile and constraining: the telescope’s ladder, the enlarger lens, the leaking seams all shape tactics. The body-as-setting (scars on palms) charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—lightning, red glow, silvering liquid—without tourist cataloging. Weather actively rewrites constellations and guides the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning censored wounds into public sky-legible words—is signaled in line 5. Escalation is one deepening: each rarefied fragment thins until “rain” alone remains, then the full poem erupts. Cost is visible when the envelope empties and the scars stay luminous on her skin. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (storm) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the cartography of scars: wounds as roads the body builds when official maps lie. No moralizing; the final whispered line is earned through concrete action. Subtext lives in the timer’s refusal to finish and the timetable’s ghost route. The ending reweights every prior redaction without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with patterned compression (“furiously tranquil,” “rarefied into light”) taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent—stormlight, red glow, scars read through poet’s bias. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Syntax mirrors emotional intensity: long breaths during development, clipped fragments at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—lightning as signature, timer as heart—never crowding. No loops or scaffold; “furiously tranquil” appears twice with reweighted meaning. Rhythm accelerates with storm and rarefaction. Minor slip: “storm kissed the dome” edges purple but is earned by prior weather integration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—censored verses rarefied into storm-projected light—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (observatory, storm) are transformed through darkroom physics and scar cartography. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final image of citizens reading their own scars in the sky feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
