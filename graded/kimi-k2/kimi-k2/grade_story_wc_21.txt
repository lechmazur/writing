<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the retrocognitive burden is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (arranging debris, pressing wet finger to page). Her final acceptance of responsibility is earned by prior beats of empathic risk. Minor drift: “solemn civil-rights archivist” is stated more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the blank diary and wind-chime driftwood crystallize the cost of bearing witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each debris arrangement tightens pattern until the lagoon mirrors it, reweighting the stake without causal reversal. Orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The obsidian lagoon, zeppelin hull, and hurricane lamp are vivid and purposeful; the lagoon’s final mirror-image directly constrains the closure beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt, rusted keys, warm water—anchoring both external and internal states.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the disappeared—is signaled early and escalates through empathic risk. The cipher’s demand for empathy narrows options; arranging debris becomes the irreversible act that forecloses emotional safety. Cost is visible in the retrocognitive flood and the blank diary.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges organically from the diary, lagoon, and naming ritual. The final image—names settling like seeds—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is carried in objects (blank diary, wind-chime bones) rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s archival gaze. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences under reverie, clipped fragments during retrocognitive jolt. No head-hopping; POV distance is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (ink-black water = spilled memory). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively”) is justified by character lexicon. Final paragraph cadence earns its breath.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of zeppelin library, obsidian lagoon, and empathic cipher feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: the story would collapse if any core element were swapped.</comment>
