<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and embodied vigilance are vivid; the contradictory pull between stoic duty and the ache to “bottle the balm” drives every micro-choice. The final sealing of the flask crystallizes a renunciation with felt cost. Minor: the widow’s pressure is more spectral suggestion than crucible, so relationship dynamics stay thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias seals the ache in the flask and sets the envelope, foreclosing anonymity with visible price. Causal chain—letter code → stone stack → flask sealing—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern room, sea glass, and salt-lilac scent constrain every beat; the glass reappears in the final image to charge the flask. Spatial choreography is tight; no white-room drift. Just shy of 9.0 because the reef itself remains off-stage abstraction rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“protect the feeling of safety”—is signaled early and tightened when Elias must decide whether to keep or transmit the distilled ache. The stacking of stones and final corking enact a visible trade-off. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodial tenderness emerges through concrete acts—stacking stones, sealing light—never stated. The flask labeled “Return” reweights the anonymous chain into mutual guardianship. Subtext in the widow’s gesture and lilac scent deepens resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, tidal, salted; perceptual signature filters every image through Elias’s wary competence. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadence for ascent, clipped for stacking stones. No head-hop; free indirect style stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous; figurative language (“throat that had swallowed the moon”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. A single mixed metaphor—“ache glowed”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse/ghost tropes are transformed through the anonymous letter chain and the distillation of safety into a portable flask. Specificity of sea glass, stacked basalt, and lilac scent anchors the premise in lived detail. Risk in lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
