<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—need to paint the answer vs. growing witness stance—is embodied in micro-choices (grinding lapis, withholding candle). The final renunciation of understanding for witnessing is earned and carries felt cost. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR and tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): pigment released into wind reweights the premise—darkness as tender presence. Cost is legible in the shift from driven urgency to quiet witness. Pattern of moonflower/painted synchrony taught early and paid off. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment (cathedral glass, pavilion ceiling) constrains choices: etched vines guide Liora’s pigment decisions; final glass ceiling holds the postcards. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“warm honey” light, “indigo snow”). Micro-setting (lapis, candle, pigment) functions as setting and tool. No credibility breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: render the night-bloom answer before winter seals the valley. Escalation is textural: each dusk adds density—postcards, pigment, synchrony—until the final release forecloses the need to understand. Cost is the shift from urgency to witness. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (new postcard) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: night-bloom as answer to an older invitation of return. Subtext in gesture—pressing postcard to glass, scattering pigment—carries the conceptual repricing. Final image (moonflowers closing like a read book) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity sustained; no thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “umbral tenderness,” “indigo snow,” rhythmic control under pressure. POV stable; perceptual signature filters every detail through Liora’s painterly gaze. No dialogue, so voice bullets apply to narration only. Patterned elision (seasonal leaps) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density lines (“She learned to grind lapis into a violet so deep it looked black until moonlight struck it”). Metaphors precise and coherent. Rhythm modulates with scene needs. No overwriting in peak beats. Clean mechanics; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: night-bloom mystery reframed as maternal continuity rather than defiance. Specificity of pigment, etched glass, and postcard spiral transforms familiar tropes. Risk in lyric compression pays off—closure legible and charged. No derivative premise; transformation test passed.</comment>
