<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—“the shard warmed against her palm” grounds motive in tactile detail. The final renunciation—leaving the shard—earns its cost through the prior accumulation of hushed absences. Motivation remains consistent: witness, not purify. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sanctifying objects tightens the stake until the bay itself stills. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the houses’ collective exhale reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One micro-turn suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bay, cottages, and even streetlights breathe as characters; the lilacs’ “hushed blaze” constrains the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt, violet, thunder—never tourist catalog. Micro-settings (compass, key, tin boat) act as setting-extensions that alter tactics. No spatial drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: teach houses to breathe without breaking. Escalation is accumulative—each sanctified object deepens the silence until the tide itself pauses. Cost is visible in the widow’s recognition and the noticer’s empty pockets. Agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete ritual: absence is the thread stitching house to memory. Final image—“the bay would remember her”—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the widow’s nod, the compass needle finding true north again. No thematic drift.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“the world narrowed to heartbeat and footfall”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent—violet, salt, hush recur with shifting weight. No POV leakage. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the final stillness.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image performs double duty—atmosphere and causality. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports the tidal rhythm. Minor register drift in “inadvertently profound” is the only hairline slip, but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<comment>Premise—“creeping normality noticer”—is fresh synthesis of hauntology and care work. Ritual of sanctifying displaced objects transforms familiar ghost-story tropes. Specificity of orris root, cedar shingles, and compass needle anchors universals. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in closure.</comment>
