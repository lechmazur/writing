<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is embodied—guilt vs. need to restore names—yet the “technically gentle” refrain edges toward label-speak. Micro-choices (re-braiding rope, softening wax) align with motive and carry felt cost. Final renunciation of war-casting is earned. Still, the reflective blocks tilt past the 20 % allowance and momentarily stall embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ice, rope, wax, aurora tightens toward the Resonant Reconfiguration—rope sings the names, wax receives them. Closure beat is on-page: “she had not restored the lost wax, but she had restored what the wax had lost.” Cost is the irreversible knowledge that she can never un-cast the cannon shells. One transition (sanctum → forge) is allowed and clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora are not mere backdrop; melting droplets carry names, rope fibers form sound waves—setting actively constrains and enables the climax. Micro-setting (wax tablet, rope braids) functions as charged objects. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: frost bite, clover scent of old wax, auroral light refracted through ice. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the erased names—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is a single deepening: rope reconfiguration turns memory into living vibration, foreclosing the path of silence. Cost is visible—the rope’s tension permanently altered, her footprints glowing with the names. Agency is hers; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of restorative memory emerges from action, not statement. Subtext in the rope’s “lullaby” and the wax’s “snowmelt ardor” reweights the premise: memory must be sung, not entombed in metal. Final image of children hearing “something familiar” offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the bronze’s future toll.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile specificity—“sparrow’s tongue,” “snowmelt ardor.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during re-braiding. No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Experimental compression (“technically gentle” as refrain) is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction stays within caster’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is selective—aurora as “green river of memory”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Minor filter-verb clusters in reflective paragraphs are voice-motivated and brief. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses lost-wax metallurgy with auroral rope-song—fresh synthesis. Transformation test: story collapses if elements swapped. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes; specificity of caster’s craft and children’s future bell feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
