<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—ink-stained fingers, rain-distorted inches—yet the contradictory impulse (curiosity vs. nostalgia) stays mostly reflective rather than enacted in a decisive beat; the final renunciation (leaving the spiral) is earned but the cost feels lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crash is reframed as migration, reweighting value itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the rain-lens constellation crystallizes the new culture. One minor causality slip: the “inherited mystery” is restated rather than resolved on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The loft’s skylight, measuring tape, and rain function as micro-setting that actively distorts measurement and refracts city lights into the new barter constellations; every sensory detail is filtered through Mara’s cartomancer bias and constrains her final choice to leave the spiral as compass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping post-crash culture—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara realizes value has migrated into gestures. The cost is conceptual (the map itself will crash), but the pressure could be sharper if a concrete resource were visibly forfeited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: value’s migration from circuits to embodied memory. The final image of the city “recompiling itself in silence” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting all prior ink and rain motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise, tactile, slightly arcane—sustained through rhythmic control and perceptual signature (“rain-beaded skylight loft,” “onyx-ink cartomancer”). No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the inverted constellation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“confide the distances… confide the answer… confide the new coordinates”—is pattern-taught and thematically apt, so forgiven. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, post-crash economics, and reverse-engineered culture feels fresh and inevitable; the risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by concrete tools (tape, cards, rain) that ground the speculative premise without gimmickry.</comment>
