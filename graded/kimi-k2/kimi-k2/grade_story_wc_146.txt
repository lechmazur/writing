<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tuner’s interiority is implied through deliberate action and silence, but no contradictory impulse is dramatized; his patience is shown rather than tested, so the final renunciation (walking away) feels pre-ordained rather than earned at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fork’s final strike reweights the town’s pulse, and the cost is the tuner’s permanent departure—felt in the lingering “lullaby for a town that had remembered how to breathe.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Environment, body, and tool interlock: the archway’s keystone, the fork’s balanced bridge, and the cobblestones’ renewed sheen all constrain the final image, charging it with tangible consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the town’s rhythm—escalates through each footfall and echo; the tightening is the moment the tuner sets the fork down and relinquishes control, letting the rhythm continue without him. Cost is visible in his solitary exit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of communal resurrection through shared cadence emerges organically from action and image; the final hush reconfigures meaning without moralizing, inviting reflection on what is lost when balance is regained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, ritualistic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors sound and texture over sight, creating a distinct cadence that modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet resonant; each sentence layers atmosphere and advances rhythm. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful, culminating in the luminous “moonlit bone” archway without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—a tuner reviving a ghost town with footsteps and a fork—feels fresh, yet the execution leans on familiar resurrection tropes. Specificity of sound and stone elevates it above template, but risk is moderate.</comment>
