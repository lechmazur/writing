<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority bristles with contradictions—her desire to offload secrets while hoarding them on her person—and embodied choices (offering the twig, stepping into the prismatic hush) drive every beat; her final release is both earned reconfiguration and felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Because/therefore” chains hold cleanly: carrying the nest twig seeds the guilt spiral → approaching the temple returns it → steam letters rejoin authors → mirrored petals absorb words. Charged Poise ending reconfigures connection; cost is visible in the rain-carried letters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lotus temple, mirrored petals, bronze tree lungs make environment and sculpture into active tools that constrain choice (return site, public installation heartwood slot) and charge the final epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unburden the secrets—intensifies from motive to irrevocable renunciation under rising cost; Elian’s sculpture forces shared absolution, narrowing options to transparency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hidden threads linking all things emerge organically from distraught character goal; final sparkle on pond water reweights premise non-declaratively without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains consistent perceptual signature and sentence-level propulsion; purposeful slips into present gerund rhythm and color-filitered perception match prismatic mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>HIGH lyrical density succeeds via purpose-driven specificity and rhythmic compression; metaphor strings build one cumulative effect rather than clutter, with no loops that dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Combines service-industry ghostwriter with public art temple ritual to forge fresh stakes; threaded epiphany feels inevitable, risks handled without obscuring clarity.</comment>
