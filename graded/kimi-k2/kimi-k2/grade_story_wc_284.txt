<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“unused courage…slow ember he had banked”), but the final reconciliation with Mara feels slightly under-motivated; her trust pivot is asserted rather than dramatized, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the snapped-shut pillbox reconfigures their shared future with audible cost. Causal chain from code to reunion is tight; only the off-stage carving of the cedar introduces a mild coincidence that doesn’t resolve the plot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mist, cliff, and signal tower are vivid and selective; the pillbox itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Weather and terrain guide every footfall, but the cedar carving feels slightly grafted rather than organically discovered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—earning back trust—tightens through each decoded fragment; the final choice to reunite the pillbox halves visibly forecloses retreat. Pressure is coherent under a situational lens; no escalation slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fixing what’s broken” emerges through concrete objects and gestures; the scar-as-map image offers resonant non-moral closure. Subtext in the match-to-violet beat is exquisite, though the line “fixing what’s broken begins with admitting the fracture” flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, weathered, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the spy’s cautious sensorium. No POV drift; even the single line of dialogue carries subtext without breaking texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, with rhythmic variation that mirrors descent and ascent. No loops or scaffold; every image earns its keep. Only the phrase “silver hush” risks mild overuse, but it is reweighted effectively at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of spy-thriller codes with quiet lyric reconciliation; the compass-rose motif transforms from tool to relational emblem. Risk-taking in the violet-burn cipher pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
