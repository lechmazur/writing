<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and character-specific; the button triggers a believable emotional cascade that anchors every beat. Micro-choices unfurl the past into present stakes without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain intact: button → memory → Polaroid → promise to amplify kindness. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she presses the warm metal to her pulse—cost legible in silence.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>File-room dust becomes tactile constraint: it supplies the medium for her mural and later drifts apart, mirroring emotional diffusion. Brass button and Polaroid function as micro-settings that narrow her options.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Unknown histories reweight from passive discovery to active promise; escalation is tightening of emotional cost rather than external stakes. One decisive intensification—she vows to magnify every kindness—narrows her future path.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from objects and kindnesses enlarged until they outshine redactions. Final dust galaxies silently reprice the foster-care record room into “hushed chapel of almost-answers”—no moralizing, pure resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is perceptually specific (“ghost of bleach,” “slow galaxies”) without overwriting. Compression of diction under emotional pressure is earned; POV never drifts.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously; no loops or purple drift. Dust into “slow galaxies” is a crisp, unstrained metaphor that lands with visceral weight.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar elements—button, Polaroid, foster files—are made fresh through tactile reprise and charged silence. Risk lies in quiet lyricism, but the payoff feels earned rather than gimmicky.</question>
