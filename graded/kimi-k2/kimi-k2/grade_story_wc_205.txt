<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt over betrayal vs. drive to reimagine—are dramatized in her frantic mirror-covering and later refusal to hide; the final relinquishment of the vase carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance shifts from caretaker of dust to gardener of possibilities, crystallized in the covenant and the crystal’s healing. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added story reweights the shard—while the final image (“constellations of hope”) carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The asteroid’s mirrors, storms, and chronal dust are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; the mirrors constrain Mara’s choices (covering vs. facing) and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who owns the past and how it may be used—tightens when Mara moves from solitary translation to shared covenant; the price is her relinquishment of sole authorship, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship of memory vs. ownership of artifacts. The final etched poem offers a resonant, non-literal answer—gardeners, not owners—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature (“bruise-colored ribbon,” “chronal dust”) that remains coherent under pressure; no head-hopping, and the cadence modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“gardens of the sky-people” returns in the poem). No loops or mixed metaphors; minor scaffold in early exposition is offset by later compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of baroque asteroid, visible time, and archaeological ethics feels fresh; the shard’s transformation from evidence to seed-crystal is an earned, non-obvious turn that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
