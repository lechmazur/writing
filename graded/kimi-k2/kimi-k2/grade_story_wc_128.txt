<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marisol’s contradictory impulses—shrewd broker vs. secret benefactor—are embodied in micro-choices (sealing envelopes like spice, pinning the returned photo). The final tear-salted realization carries visible cost and reconfigures her stance. Secondary characters (Theo, Marta) apply direct pressure that alters the trio’s operation. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the returned locket reweights the “cycle” premise with undeniable emotional cost. Causal linkage holds—mistaken letter → pact → returned photo—without off-stage resolution. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity. The final image (“next freighter would sail with…”) crystallizes options under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Seaside night, open-air symphony, star-drunk library windows—details are filtered through Marisol’s cargo-broker gaze (ledger margins, anchor stamps). The library’s vaulted ceiling becomes a living chart that constrains their nightly ritual; the telescope on the roof later alters dockhands’ tactics. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency (storm threat). Micro-setting (locket) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and tightened when the mistaken letter forces a choice: risk exposure or institutionalize kindness. Each nightly session escalates density; dockhands’ daughter stamps anchors, grants fund welding classes—cost is visible in ledger margins. Coincidence (returned locket) complicates but does not resolve; it crystallizes the cycle’s cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical compassion emerges through concrete particulars—pressed edelweiss, anchor stamps, ledger doodles—never stated. Final image (“tide returns what it borrows”) offers non-literal resonance that reweights every prior act. Subtext in Theo’s bow, Marta’s weeping, stevedore’s locket all deepen the question of visibility vs. anonymity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marisol weighs envelopes “like precious spice,” notices “star-drunk breeze.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines during symphony fade, clipped cadence at storm threat. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“Dear Marta”). No POV drift; free indirect style stays clean. Voice coheres as shrewd yet secretly tender broker.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective (“salted her lips like sea spray”) and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm breathes with scene—accelerates during envelope tracing, slows at locket return. Clean grammar; pronouns unambiguous. Final line lands with cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cargo manifests as stowaway kindness, symphony moving indoors during storm, locket traveling world via cleat—each feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky structural compression (months in paragraphs) pays off in resonant montage. No stock tropes; occupation details (ledger margins, anchor stamps) are specific and transformative. Transformation test fails if names changed.</comment>
