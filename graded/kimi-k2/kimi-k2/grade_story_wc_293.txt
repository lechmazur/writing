<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fiddler’s interiority is embodied and specific—her noticing scaffold-wrap Morse, the flake vibrating against wood—yet the “never” she renounces remains abstract; her final step onto the bridge earns the change but the cost is more luminous than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lattice reforges every “never” into suspension cables; the flake fuses with a sound like ice cracking, a felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern taught early (pixelated flake, scaffold flutters) and reweighted at the end without causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mountain pullout, fog, scaffold wrap, and glass flake are vivid and selective; the scaffold wrap becomes railing and the flake becomes staircase—objects constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpt possibility from “never”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the lattice demands she enter, and the cost (loss of hitchhiker, erasure of “never”) is visible. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming impossibility emerges through the bridge of “nevers”; the final image of the valley dissolving into fireflies offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent—perceptual signature in “luminous disbelief,” “scaffold wrap flutters as sheet music.” No head-hopping; patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (ice cracking, pixelated snow). No loops or scaffold; syntax modulates with emotional crests. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of wet-plate photography, scaffold Morse, and pixelated metaphysics; the bridge of reclaimed “nevers” feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
