<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her cheek against the shard, the salt on her tongue—but the only micro-choice that alters her path is the final whisper before planting the third seed; earlier beats are observational. The earned shift from searcher to carrier is credible and costs her the need to keep searching, yet the contradiction between passive witnessing and active decision stays under-dramatized until that last beat. Still, the embodied emotion and singular POV keep her above the 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror dissolves, the bird gifts a new seed, and Lira’s stance flips from retrieval to stewardship—cost is the forever-pulse of “cheerful gloom” she now carries. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each seed deepens pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“iridescent cave inside the giant crystal geode”) and never breaks; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the phrase “before memory fades” is repeated ritualistically but never tightens the clock on-page; still, the lens and cost remain intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The geode is not backdrop—it supplies the only tools (crater glass, hollow question-mark, prism) that enable the three plantings and the final mirror. Light/shadow duality at the center directly charges the mirror image, making environment constrain choice and reconfigure meaning. Sensory selection stays urgent: crunch of glass, warmth of shard, salt on tongue. Micro-setting (the hollow shaped like “?”) literally shapes the first sprout, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the path that mattered most”—is signaled early and tightens with each seed. The second seed’s memory of the bird tasting gloom deepens the pattern, forcing recognition that the cave itself erases corridors; this is the single meaningful deepening required. Cost is legible: she forfeits the illusion that paths can be fully restored, accepting instead the perpetual pulse of missing pieces. Agency is present but gentle—planting, whispering—sufficient for lyric mode, yet not razor-forced under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is not recovered but metabolized—carried forward as weight and song. The migrating bird’s yearly return and the geode’s erasure create a cyclical moral calculus that resists tidy comfort. Final image of shards clinking like “syllables” reweights prior motifs, offering non-literal resonance. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: she notices hairline cracks, tastes salt, hears ribs “ring like bells.” Syntax mirrors emotional swell—looping cursive of light, spiral of silver—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; diction remains within her mythic yet tactile lexicon. Rhythm accelerates at planting beats and exhales at mirror dissolution, proving purposeful modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but disciplined: “cheerful gloom” recurs with shifting weight, no synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles (vine of light, mirror of glass) stay consistent with geode logic. One minor scaffold: “before memory fades” appears four times, risking mantra-drift, yet the final instance pays off by becoming the seed she now carries. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; sentences vary in length and opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The “recollectionist” occupation, crater-glass that transliterates emotion, and migrating bird-courier synthesize into a fresh mythic ecology that feels inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation could have collapsed into preciousness, but the piece commits fully, letting the cave erase its own corridors rather than gifting easy restoration. The final reconfiguration—missing pieces are not lost but shared—reweights the entire premise without late rule changes. Specificity of the beach that “no longer existed” anchors universals in vanished geography.</comment>
