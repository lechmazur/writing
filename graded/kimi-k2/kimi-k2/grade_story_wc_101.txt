<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is embodied and specific—her kissing the bell, the flour-dust on the baby’s forehead—yet the final “declare” speech edges toward thematic summary rather than earned contradiction, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each food-run beat layers density until the seed-crate reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—“tomorrow is already planted”—with conceptual cost legible in the star-painted lid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The terra-cotta arbor, cracked tiles, and low moon are vivid and selective; the arbor’s broken trellis literally snags the moonlight, charging the final circle. Micro-setting constrains the gathering and thus the ending.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keeping the fragile circuit alive—tightens when Tomasz questions sustainability; Lila’s answer forecloses doubt by redefining nourishment as cultural vote. Cost is felt in the scarcity of saffron and the anonymity of donors.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of cultural continuity through quiet acts emerges organically from rice, saffron, and seed packets; final declaration avoids moralizing, letting the bell’s pure note and the seeds reconfigure meaning without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lila’s perceptual signature—sound as memory, scent as inheritance—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates from hushed bell-notes to declarative cadence, matching rising pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. “Amplified quiet that carried farther than shouting ever could” is precise and earned. Only minor density in “tasted like iron and honey” keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sanctions-era food runs as curriculum of cultural survival. Anonymous donations reimagined as votes in the dark. Specificity of saffron wedding rice and star-painted crate transforms familiar exile trope.</comment>
