<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-driven quest is embodied in concrete micro-choices (climbing, tuning by shedding assumptions, tucking the sphere over his heart). The interior contradiction—yearning to replay death yet accepting its echo—culminates in earned stasis when he walks away vibrating with the next story. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hush → shard contact → city exhales → mother’s “hello” loops. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sphere against his ribs reweights grief into generative listening. Cost is the irreversible dissolution of the shard and the hollow it fills. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The rusted chandelier city, swaying catwalks, and gorge shadow are filtered through Kael’s signal-tuned perception; every bolt hums under moonlight. The star fragment and the sphere become micro-settings that constrain the final choice—he carries the merged metal next to his heart, not in hand. Weather and lunar perigee tighten the temporal window, forcing ascent and descent within one night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: recover the first syllable of every ending to replay his mother’s first “hello.” Pressure tightens when lunar perigee peaks; the shard rises only now. Agency: he tunes by shedding assumptions, a visible tactic that costs him prior certainties. The final trade-off—grief hollow replaced by sphere—lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: beginnings are chosen echoes, not fixed points. The mother’s “hello” looping inside the sphere offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the chalked sign, the sphere’s warmth—rather than statement. Final image reweights prior material: silence is no longer absence but fertile ground.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s signal-tuned perception; diction is lyrical yet precise (“serenely electric hush,” “liquid light”). Rhythm modulates with ascent breathlessness and descent cadence. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual information. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“rusted chandelier,” “soft avalanche of possibility”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction is justified by Kael’s celestial vocation. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fuses cosmic radio myth with intimate grief in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. The shard-of-hush concept and tuning-by-shedding-assumptions method are non-obvious and fully committed to. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No recognizable template echoes.</comment>
