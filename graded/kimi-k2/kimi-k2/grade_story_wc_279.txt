<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the artist’s contradictory impulses—yearning to remember yet choosing release—play out in micro-choices (widening the ring, pocketing flake and nub). Motivation stays rooted in her perceptual stance and culminates in an earned renunciation with visible cost: she accepts the silence and leaves the mandala behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lilac blossom folds, the hush crystallizes, and the artist steps away carrying the cost of silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density and cadence shift reweight meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, tile flake, and chalk nub function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the flake literally translates dust into murmurs, guiding her final gesture. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image of the sealed mandala.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to let memory dissolve—is signaled early and tightened once when she widens the mandala’s ring, trading remembrance for emergent pattern. Cost is felt in the silhouettes’ silent goodbyes and her pocketed relics. Agency drives the escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “unlearning as creation” emerges through concrete particulars: chalk lines replace words, memories pigment sand, silence becomes grammar. Final image of the lilac bud closing offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice—lilac, hush, moth wings—remains consistent and taught early. Compression and elision (“soundless laugh”) are legible at closure. Perceptual signature is sharp; no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final paragraph slows to crystallize the hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-loss as generative art practice, silence taught as grammar. Risky lyric structure pays off in charged closure. Specificity of lilac mist and tile-flake translator prevents generic feel.</comment>
