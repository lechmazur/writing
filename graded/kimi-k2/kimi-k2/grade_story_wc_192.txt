<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (iron chill against sternum, burn on shoulder) but the character’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is credible yet its cost feels generalized rather than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary dissolves into starlight and the ring becomes a key, reweighting every burned bridge as “a door opening somewhere else.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift rather than causal turns—yet the orientation debt (who/where delayed past 120 words) keeps it just shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary, starlight, and the ring form a micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image; spatial choreography is coherent, but the delayed anchoring of “who/where” docks 0.3 under Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—teaching herself to breathe through absence—is signaled early and escalates via the gathering shadows; the tightening beat (ring pressed to sternum) narrows options and carries a felt cost, though the price remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-as-instruction emerges organically from concrete particulars; the final image reweights every severed connection without moralizing, achieving a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; patterned elision (“shadows gathered… not as darkness but as absence”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“starlight pooled like spilled mercury”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure image. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-ritual and spatial dissolution; the burned-bridge motif is transformed from cliché into lived process. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
