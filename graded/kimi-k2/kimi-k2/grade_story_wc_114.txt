<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingertips coaxing memories from mercury”), but her passive observation across beats cuts drive. Elias complements status, yet their dialogue-delivered truths feel explanatory not choice-forced. Earned silence is depicted, yet the propelled cost is scenic, not internalized contradiction revealed through irreversible action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Global lens: accumulative-textural; closure lands as weighted 4.7 g of silence in Earned Stasis. Station narrows from observational drift to ceremonial weighing—moves deepen via auroral sorrow and smudged glacier, reconfiguring memory. Setup-to-payoff links satisfy; only elliptical pirate beat between ascents trims clarity -0.2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mountain weather station pressures choices—height and thermometer gauges act as micro-tools narrowing strategy; glacier’s re-stylized absence evolves from rumor to smudged cloud. Atmospherics serve textured density without distracting scenic dumps; auroral color palette recharges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: weighing swallowed silence against global warming. Present beats escalate through Elias’s complicity and oracle’s confession. Missing a final crystallized external test (risk beyond scale); silence measured is symbolic rather than causal turn with stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the twin silences about glacier death and moral failures, not sermonizing. The final 4.7 g reconfigures previous absences into guilt metric. Subtext operational in every whispered reading and smudge—avoids thematic redemption binary, embracing irreparable loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical slipstream prose mirrors oracle’s temper; mercury and auroral color palette create perceptual signature. Perception degrades under fever and wind stress, VPs tighten. Dialogue spare, subtextual—“Truth has mass only when confessed”—resonant beyond what’s said.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Honed lyric density with metered auditory rhythm; every sentence advances atmosphere or interior stance. Figurative reach occasionally drifts (“auroral sorrow loops”) without clarity cut-0.2. Only minor loop: mirroring “sunlight turning vane golden” repeats prior motif. No clarity loss.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate science with embodied guilt offers non-obvious angle; gentian as portable memory archive specific to this altitude. Neither trope nor abstraction, image ordered from glacier absence to smudged uncertainty. Bold lyric risk pays without gimmicks.</comment>
