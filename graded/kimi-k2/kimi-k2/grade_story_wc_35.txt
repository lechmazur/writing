<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is precise—tasting remorse, holding it “like a too-hot spoonful”—but reliance on lyrical summary in lieu of dramatized impulse makes the final ingestion read more ritualistic than struggled. Slight over-calibration smooths the cost of bearing the lord’s grief, blunting the flaw-driven tension that would push this to 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens holds as Accumulatively Textural: grief layers accrue until saturation compels release; each “salt flower” crystalizes past and present. Closure beats—swallowing memory, exhaling salt—land with visible conceptual cost; final image of “fortress walls no longer weeping” is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes the whole dream-frame. No artifacts disturb causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>From “sandstone walls steaming like fresh bread” to coral columns that soften back to life, sensory world-building is both vivid and instrumental; the steaming battlement literally steams away grief. Micro-setting (dinner-plate tidal pool) constrains Lira’s method, directly shaping the culminating broth. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—cleansing the fortress of unabsolved remorse—escalates cleanly: each drop of thawing coral adds urgency until release is unavoidable. Cost is legible: Lira risks being subsumed by the very grief she distills. The beat-to-beat pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief becoming sustenance is evoked entirely through concrete actions (broth, salt flowers) rather than statement. The final image offers a Charged Poise: memory still exists, yet “only the echo of loss” remains—an ethically complex reweighting that resists moralization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is sensorily embodied and consistent; metaphors (“walls steaming like fresh bread,” “gauntlet slipping”) feel character-bound rather than author-display. Controlled lyric pacing heightens pressure without sacrificing lucidity. Compression and ellipsis are purposeful and paid-off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose texture is dense yet breathable; each sentence pushes pressure (figurative vehicles rarely repeat). No scaffold, synonym loops, or mixed-metaphor clutter. Slight risk of purple flourish is contained within the heightened dream logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—chef-alchemist feeding grief back as flavor—freshly synthesizes culinary magic, underworld coral, and restorative gastronomy. No precursor images or phrases feel like repurposed tropes; final inversion of “lamb, drowned daughter, forgiven” arrives from within the invented system’s rules. Braided risk with disciplined follow-through.</comment>
