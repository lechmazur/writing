<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ghost syllable I could not swallow”), but the final choice—“Go”—leans on lyric assertion rather than dramatized contradiction; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship sinks, the card crumbles, and the protagonist renames herself while floating. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each image reweights the stake of remembrance vs. release with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The carnival ship’s warped planks, dripping chandeliers, and upside-down garden constrain every move; the emerald card’s final sprout literally pulls the protagonist toward the exit, charging the last image with irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep or relinquish the sister’s memory—tightens through each surreal beat; the final chord exhalation forces the decisive trade-off, with the ship’s dissolution as undeniable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as both tether and cage emerges through concrete particulars; the ending’s open water reconfigures “unkindled solace” as perpetual motion rather than arrival, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic compression under pressure (“the ship groaned, a whale carcass dreaming of music”); perceptual signature remains consistent, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“cotton candy turned to ash,” “cannon wounds”) serve the fever-dream texture. No loops or scaffold; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fuses ghost-ship gothic with lyric memoir in a way that feels inevitable; the upside-down garden of names is a fresh, non-obvious image that could not be transplanted elsewhere without collapse.</comment>
