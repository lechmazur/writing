<comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—daughter of an arsonist turned firefighter—grounds every beat, but the gift of the coin to a stranger she just met edges close to un-earned epiphany; cost is visible (the coin is gone), yet the emotional calculus could plume more sharply in the handshake moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: firefighter confronts remnant stake of father’s fire → relieves child → translates pain into song → releases last bird. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the final bird’s song floats more as image than a felt cost that tightens the stakes.</comment>

<comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand act as both mirror and medium: the grains embed in collarbone sweat, later sculpt into whistle-birds. Environment constrains movement (sand slides under boots) and supplies the material that transmutes fire memory into breath-music.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—escalates when kite snag revives fire boundaries; micro-choice to pass coin/last bird intensifies commitment after visible tension. Coincidence (exact stake remains) complicates rather than resolves; cost is present but not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The arc is a quiet hymn: inherited trauma transmuted into protective tenderness without preachiness. Final image of bird drifting on obsidian reweights earlier fire trauma—but the last sentence trails rather than detonates, tempering full thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Liquid, kelp-drunk syntax sustains lyric compression; no POV drift, and register remains internally coherent. Distinct perceptual signature (Mara’s body as lava conduit) taught early and honored till last line. Minor rhythmic flutter in “whistled when the wind passed through” but not disruptive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are disciplined; density rarely bloats peak moment. A single mixed image (“a sound like water striking hot stone” nearly jars) but recovery swift. Information density tight; every descriptive line also registers physical or emotional movement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of volcanic setting and therapeutic archetype—arsonist’s child as fire-rescuer—avoids cliché by granular sensory handling. Risk stays controlled; nothing so experimental that clarity suffers at closure, though originality leans to textured iteration rather than structural audacity.</comment>
