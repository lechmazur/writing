<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the urn fragment and gear act as concrete extensions of her contradictory impulses. The final choice—accepting velvet time—earns its cost through the tactile memory sequence. Minor drift: the elderly woman’s arrival feels slightly external, not fully pressured by the protagonist’s prior choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused compass reweights the premise, and the velvet future arrives with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each texture is a beat that deepens the stake. Orientation is taught early via “hours no longer marched in order.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Emerald silo, urn fragment, and snow-globe gear all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“greenish light through bullet holes”). No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—“to rediscover the capsule’s message”—tightens through escalating textures that foreclose abstraction. The final velvet moment crystallizes the cost of accepting unmeasurable time. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the texture-as-time motif; no moralizing. The final velvet image reweights prior textures without statement. Subtext in the swallow-mural and gold-lacquered timer enriches resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice sustained; perceptual signature is selective and biased (“smelled of library glue”). Patterned elision taught early (“texture—sometimes velvet, sometimes broken glass”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>High information density, zero loops, rhythm modulates with pressure. Metaphors are precise and integrated (“time like glitter”). No overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-texture and garage-sale espionage; tropes transformed through embodied stakes. The fused urn-gear compass feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure heightens coherence.</comment>
