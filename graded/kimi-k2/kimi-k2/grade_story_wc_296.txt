<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"frost-numbed fingers," "taste of her own unspoken truth"—but the conjurer’s resurrection feels slightly under-motivated; his return is granted rather than earned by her micro-choices. The druid’s contradictory impulses (guard vs. confession) drive every beat, culminating in the thorn-pierced feeding of the plant. Cost is visible: blood, confession, and the plant’s death. Still, the conjurer’s solidity is more gift than consequence, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard mirrors now reflect two figures, and the lake ice becomes a bridge—felt cost is the druid’s shed armor and the plant’s withering. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each expanding circle of ice reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4. One minor ellipsis—the conjurer’s physical return—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The orchard vortex, mirrored trunks, and black lake are vivid and selective; the ice circles literally constrain movement and map her path. Micro-setting (the bloom’s thorns) forces the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis: iron-and-apple scent, frost-numbed fingers. Environment charges the final image when the mirrored trunks finally reflect two figures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding the courage to face what mirrors hide—is signaled early and tightened when the seed demands planting where nothing grows. Escalation is driven by her agency: pressing the seed, feeding the bloom, accepting thorns. Cost is visible (blood, confession, plant death). The conjurer’s return is a gift rather than a consequence of her tactics, slightly blurring the final pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the armor of silence versus the ache to be seen. The frozen confession is a literalized subtext; its melting drip-by-drip enacts the unsaid becoming spoken. Final image—two reflections in once-blank mirrors—offers a non-moral answer: acknowledgment, not absolution. No thematic statement intrudes; resonance is carried by scent, thorns, and open water.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “warlike serenity,” “branches writhing like serpents.” Perceptual signature is consistent—selective attention to mirrors, scent, and cold light. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences collapse into short, thorn-sharp fragments at climax. No POV drift; conjurer’s single line is subtext-rich and tonally aligned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “expanding circles” is repeated three times but serves as taught pattern, paid off when ice folds into a bridge. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Final line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—cursed orchard, drowned lover, magical seed—are transformed through embodied specificity and the literalized frozen confession. The mirrored trunks that refuse reflection, the flesh-eating plant that devours lies: these feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression succeeds; closure remains legible. Synthesis of mythic and psychological registers is non-obvious and fully committed.</comment>
