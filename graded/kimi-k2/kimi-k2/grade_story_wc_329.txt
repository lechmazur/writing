<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Violinist’s contradictory impulses—fear vs. duty to reawaken beauty—are embodied in micro-choices (pressing shell to pulse, funneling fear into the final note). Interiority is concrete, but the teacher’s vanishing is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting motivation depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each heartbeat-driven note layers density until the locust shell’s amber pulse reweights the orchard. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—beauty “decides to stay”—with felt cost (bridge dissolves, shell crumbles). No causality breaks; orientation anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass-and-ivy sky-bridge, iron peaches, verdigris tears—selective sensory detail mirrors internal stakes. The orchard’s transformation from iron to green constrains the final choice and charges the closing image. Micro-setting (locust shell as pendant) functions as setting-object that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore beauty against mechanical petrifaction—tightens via escalating statue threat. One decisive intensification: guardians stacking into a tower forces the violinist’s final heartbeat crescendo. Cost is visible (bridge shatter risk, shell’s destruction).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty’s persistence versus mechanized entropy. Final image—constellations returning to tarnished but luminous statues—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the silence after the last chord reweights the city’s graying sky.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “bow poised like a question,” “resonantly soft echo.” POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with stress—staccato signals under threat, softer cadence at closure. Compression taught early (“signal through heart rhythms”) and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density, zero loops. Metaphors are precise (“slipped between the statues’ joints like warm oil”). No register drift. Final sentence crystallizes without overwriting. Minor scaffold in “tarnished wonder” phrase repetition, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heartbeat-as-music to unpetrify an orchard policed by living statues. Tropes (enchanted garden, mechanical curse) are transformed through embodied stakes and locust-wood specificity. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
