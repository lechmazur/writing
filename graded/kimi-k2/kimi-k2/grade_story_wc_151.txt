<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—chalk moon/sun date, refusal of glass nostalgia—but the final backward walk reads as gesture rather than earned renunciation with visible cost; contradictory impulses are present yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk glyph layers density until the winged envelope reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s stance crystallizes with the city waking—felt cost is the surrender of immediacy for slow meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The arcade’s rose light, brass postbox, and marble mirror constrain her movements and echo in the final fractured reflection; setting is not backdrop but tactile pressure that charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning before it is mailed”—tightens through each chalk delay; the act of mailing becomes the irreversible cost. One clear deepening suffices, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of margins versus center emerges organically from chalk code and slow mail; final instruction “Read the cracks, not the words” offers resonant, non-moral answer that reweights all prior symbols.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Distinct lyric texture—hologram penny-farthings, subsonic lullaby—remains anchored in Mara’s perceptual bias; no POV drift, rhythm modulates with dawn’s hush to city’s hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. Only minor scaffold—“she knelt again” twice—does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Futuristic nostalgia reframed through tactile chalk and obsolete mail feels inevitable; synthesis of antique postbox and hologram bikes is specific, not gimmick, and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
