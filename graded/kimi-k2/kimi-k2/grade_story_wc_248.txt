<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“volcanic tenderness trembling in her chest”), but the shift from arsonist guilt to sacrificial guardian is compressed into a single beat; the curator remains off-page, so relationship crucible is absent. Motivation is clear and stakes escalate, yet the final self-sacrifice feels slightly foregone rather than wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the promise is redefined from dyad to communal covenant, cost is the arsonist’s bodily dissolution into archive-heartbeat. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mural adds density until color drains into tapestry, tightening stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early (“beneath volcanic basalt”) and closure reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Obsidian walls, cryogenic sarcophagus, and glass-dust key are tactile constraints that shape tactics; the archive’s volcanic geology mirrors internal magma. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“smelling faintly of fire forgiven”). Final image of warm books anchors transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem the broken promise—tightens through escalating artistic acts that foreclose retreat; cost is her life-as-archive. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence is absent. One deepening suffices: murals → mirrors → tapestry ignition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stories as living covenant between librarian and reader. Subtext in mirrors turning destruction into palimpsest; final image of children finding warm books reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers—arsonist becomes guardian yet remains absent from the town.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, volcanic tenderness modulating from remorse to steady glow. Syntax mirrors emotional pressure: long spirals for murals, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; perceptual signature distinct (“ash patterns of memory”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent (lava, phoenix, tapestry). Minor scaffold in “every stroke was a confession” but momentum recovers. Final line crystallizes with sonic echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-librarian as archive-heartbeat, tapestry as living promise. Tropes of redemption and sacrifice are transformed through volcanic archive ecology. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
