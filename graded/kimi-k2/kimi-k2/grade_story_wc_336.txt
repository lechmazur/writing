<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s interior contradiction—joy in surplus vision curdling into fear of loss—drives every beat; the marrow-cost is embodied in silvering hands and accepted in a final micro-choice (knife planted blade-down). Motivation stays rooted in the creative trait and escalates to sacrificial graft. Minor slip: “insatiably creative” is stated more than dramatized in early lines.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the worlds are braided, Arin’s life paid, future generations guaranteed wonder. Causal chain (seed → filament → creatures → color return) is tight; cost is visible in silvered bones and vanished body. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall constrain the ritual physically and acoustically; spray becomes prism, moss becomes deathbed. Micro-setting (copper threads, jade/starlight leaves) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Arin’s synesthetic creativity without tourist overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s color—tightens when grafting demands Arin’s marrow. One decisive escalation: each spun strand extracts life, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral, not abstract; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the literal act of grafting worlds: creation demands reciprocal cost. Final image of sapling drinking silvered bones reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext of generational legacy is carried by the lens of leaves, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, with synesthetic perceptual signature (“silver syllables,” “coppery taste of a child’s unanswered question”). Rhythm modulates from lullaby to loom under rising pressure. No head-hop; diction stays within Arin’s artisan-poet lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each image does double duty (waterfall spray = prism + toll). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting in “gratitude itself were pigment” but does not stall closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of arborist craft and cosmic weaving; heirloom seed as multiversal graft is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the marrow-cost image. Avoids generic portal fantasy tropes through tactile specificity.</comment>
