<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific (sentinel noticing vines’ slowed sap), emotions embodied in taste/smell. One flaw: the “passionate subtlety” ending smile feels authorial label rather than earned. Otherwise single POV holds throughout, contradiction between holding on and letting felt on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Earned Stasis lands: pressing ash into soil with smile is clear before/after renunciation that forecloses reunion. Causal line traceable from entering pavilion → candle-burn → ash burial. Frame remains lucid under Accumulative/Textural lens, minor drift when “drawing parallels” is asserted not dramatized (−0.1).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Amber walls and autumn vineyard are selective, textured; the seventh-row gap actually constrains his stance (sees her signature absence). Moon-temperature sensory layering tightens final choice. Pavilion functions as micro-setting tool, not postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—permission to understand vs possess—intensifies through tactile rituals (placing, tasting ash). One clear deepening: realization that missing post is fertile gap, narrowing options to stewardship not pursuit. Cost scales to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from repeated sensory parallels (vine rows = sentences); mismatches reweighted from “wrong for each other” to necessary gap. No overt moral; final image of ash as communion achieves CR with undeniable conceptual cost to any hope of return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical yet controlled prose; sensory bias (sentinel trained ear catches sap slowing) feels genuine. No head-hop. Purposeful elision (none of her spoken lines appear) taught early and legitimized by “wind answered”. Echoing diction stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with emotional swell; high-density lines carry three jobs at once (“tasting smoke and lavender” merges sense, ritual, symbolism). No scaffold or synonym churn. Final paragraph’s repetition of “root, not ruin” is a payoff pattern, not loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh: a post-mortem love story told via vineyard pruning logic. Mismatch-as-gap idea is original inversion rather than stock irreconcilable. Bold to let absent beloved speak through missing stakes and ash ritual. Derivative elements (autumn dusk, pavilion) transcended by specificity.</comment>
