<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lila’s interior contradiction—guilt versus duty—drives every beat; her micro-choice to lay the father-boot photo at the mirror crystallizes the arc with visible emotional cost. Embodied emotion (“wet with lake spray”) avoids label-speak. The final renunciation of sole guardianship is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of solitary silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lila’s spoken confession reconfigures the town’s collective memory and her own stance, cost paid in public vulnerability. Causal lens holds—each photograph laid is a because/therefore step toward the final sharing. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation undermines the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frosted ridgeway, resurfacing steeples, and the cracked mirror function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice—Lila’s path literally leads her to the mirror where memory must be faced. The sapphire label’s color anchors twilight and later charges the tavern’s renaming. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release of the town’s final secret—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when Lila speaks the withheld truth; the cost is her twenty-year silence broken in front of the returned townsfolk. One meaningful escalation: the mirror scene forces the irreversible confession. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: shared truth versus solitary shame. The mirrored hush reweights from private guilt to communal healing without moralizing. Final image of lanterns along the old trail offers non-literal resonance—stories now “unforgotten.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: frost-crunch boots, lantern heartbeat, “wet teeth” steeples. Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short declaratives at confession, longer lyric cadence in closure. No POV drift; every detail is filtered through Lila’s vigilance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“lantern swinging like a slow heartbeat”) and never muddies causality. Clean mechanics, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Resurfaced drowned town as frame for memory-exorcism feels fresh; transformation test passes—swap setting and the emotional arc collapses. Sapphire label repurposed from found object to communal sigil is an earned, non-gimmick turn.</comment>
