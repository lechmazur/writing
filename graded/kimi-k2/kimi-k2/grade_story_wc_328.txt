<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vale’s contradictory impulses—grief for Orion vs. scientific detachment—are embodied in the arrowhead and crystallize when she chooses to become the cosmic joke; the cost is her lost humanity. Interiority is specific, embodied, and escalates under pressure. Minor slip: Orion’s off-page status weakens relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vale’s metamorphosis rewrites the rule-set with visible cost (translucent skin, comet veins). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. One micro-turn (phone liquefies) tightens options. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Underground garden, frost, and bioluminescent ferns anchor early and evolve into orbital starlight; the cordless phone constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Vale’s researcher bias. Micro-setting (arrowhead as stylus) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn bitterness into cosmic joke—tightens when Vale etches new coordinates; cost is her physical dissolution. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; gravity-bending intensifies stakes. One credible loss: her human form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between grief and cosmic absurdity; the final image of frost flowers on concrete reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in static lullaby and arrowhead reprise resonates. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, patterned, and taught early—holds under pressure. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity; “gravitationally playful” and “frostbitten hope” are voice-motivated neologisms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates during metamorphosis. Minor mixed metaphor “private planet” does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid research, cosmic horror, and grief comedy; premise commits fully. Risky gravity-bending and phone-liquefaction are earned by prior pattern. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
