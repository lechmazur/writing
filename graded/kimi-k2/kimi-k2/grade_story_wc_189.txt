<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is textured and embodied; the moment he touches the cicada and memory floods sideways is a vivid micro-choice that reweights his stance. Mara’s arrival supplies relational pressure that forces a shared decision, altering their estrangement. The final renunciation—leaving the cicada undisturbed—earns its cost through prior sensory and emotional accumulation. Minor slip: “time feels like this, I think” edges toward label-speak but is immediately grounded in tactile image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the siblings share the cicada’s vision, reconfiguring silence into held-breath presence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final tide-inhale reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; causality is carried by embodied memory rather than explicit because/therefore, fitting the lyric mode. Cost is legible in the unmailed letter’s salt and the footprints filling with phosphorescence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto, lantern, barnacles, and tidepool mirror internal states without overt symbolism; the ledge constrains the cicada’s placement and later submersion. Micro-setting (cicada as handled object) charges the final image when it drinks Mara’s tears. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: chronicler notes salinity, then surrenders to texture. No orientation drift; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing sibling silence—tightens when Mara arrives and the cicada reveals the withheld letter. One meaningful deepening: shared vision converts private grief into mutual witness. Agency is renunciation (leaving cicada) with visible cost (no more foresight). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (Mara’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of time-as-tidepool emerges through concrete particulars—salt, phosphorescence, held breath—never abstract assertion. Final notebook line reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silence and steam-curl questions carries emotional aftereffect. Complexity lingers: silence can be kindness or wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; chronicler’s perceptual signature filters every detail through scientific habit then surrender to texture. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences in stillness, clipped fragments when Mara arrives. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens around shared cicada vision. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “I can’t bear another silence.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information without redundancy. Metaphors (barnacles as coins, seaweed fray) are fresh and integrated. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs with rhythmic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory-storing jade cicada in tidal grotto—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Fresh synthesis of chronicler’s empiricism with lyric mysticism. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
