<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—cartographer’s precision vs. vanishing dread—are embodied in her tactile micro-choices (tracing condensation, tasting water). The final step onto moving water crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she forfeits the outpost’s safety for emergence. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One minor slip: “subtly confident” is asserted once without fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake exhales, the current moves south, and Lira’s stance is reconfigured with felt cost (outpost abandoned). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image (condensation, falcon, phrasebook) layers density until the final cadence shift. Causality is implied rather than linear, yet coherent. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation clock are not backdrop but active constraints: the bead’s slide triggers the lake crack, the ridge channels her path. Micro-setting (windowpane delta) functions as timepiece and omen. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Environment directly shapes the final choice—ice becomes vessel—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where the rivers begin before vanishing”—is signaled early and tightened by each beat: falcon dive, melting circle, forfeited shelter. One meaningful deepening: the phrasebook’s absorption of moisture reweights the stake from search to declaration. Cost is visible (outpost lost, predecessor’s fate recalled). Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mapping-as-survival emerges through concrete particulars: phrasebooks, condensation, falcon. The final image—cloud birthed from a silver thread—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (laying books spine-to-spine) and silence. Complexity lingers: emergence is not guaranteed, only wagered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “a low, voweled murmur that fogged the air.” Compression and elision are taught early (“three winters”) and paid off. No head-hopping; perception is strictly Lira’s. Syntax modulates with pressure—short percussive beats at climax. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is taut, lyrical, and propulsive: “the lake began to exhale.” Each sentence advances image or stakes; zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“black comma against the blank page”—and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates into the final cadence without overwriting. Clean mechanics; no artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses cartography, myth, and linguistic archaeology into a fresh synthesis. The falcon as editorial courier, condensation as clock, phrasebook as portal—all feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
