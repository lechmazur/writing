<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“felt the entire farm inhale, a vast collective sigh that pulled her grief out through her pores”), but the stranger’s motivation remains opaque, slightly undercutting the relational crucible. The final diffusion is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the barrier’s transformation into breathing membrane reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light, spores, and grief accumulates until the cadence shift in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mushroom farm is not backdrop; its permeable plastic lungs constrain every move and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“scent of rain on copper”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding letting go—tightens when the farm itself “chooses instead to invite it in.” One decisive intensification suffices; cost is felt in the diffusion of her grief into spore-light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the living diagram of permeability, the lattice of memory. Final image offers non-literal answer—“her grief now glowing in alien gardens”—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature sustained; lyric compression taught early (“rows of glowing caps pulsed like slow heartbeats”) and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; POV remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density, zero loops, rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“moonlit bruises”) stays within lyric register and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: intrusion science meets fungal bioluminescence as metaphor for permeable grief. Risk-taking (diffusion as resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
