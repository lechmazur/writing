<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interior contradiction—drowned past vs floating present—animates every beat; her orderly intuition shows in tactile graffiti navigation, her final shout embodies hopeful desperation with earned cost. Tomasso serves as a catalyst rather than character, but Lila’s agency remains clear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mural repaints, chip vibrations, maze tightening layer pressure until the final image reweights meaning. Closure crystallizes as a Charged Poise—no contracts signed, city unpurchased, cost paid in corporate embarrassment and Lila’s precarious stance atop the Whale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass calliope, lantern flickers, tilted dock establish floating Naples with sensory density; graffiti, whale ribs, chip heat guide Lila’s path. Carnival as mutable skin constrains tactics: mirrors multiply targets, painted maze turns buyers back; raft drifts under corporate horns, final image framed by “PROPERTY OF MEMORY” wall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from survey glyphs → mural counter-measures → chip-guided reorganization → dawn standoff; each intensification driven by Lila’s tactical choices, not luck. Corporate pursuit, carnival resistance, and dual allegiance converge in visible price: buyers routed, city unsold, future still precarious.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs commodification emerges through repurposed murals, encodings, and final signage—never sermonized. Hopeful desperation persists as carnival brass swells; ending enacts the story’s central tension instead of explaining it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice marries sensorial precision with rhythmic syntax—“riotous murals turning jokes into barcodes”—then compresses under pressure to spray-can arcs. POV remains intimate; carnival argot feels lived-in without caricature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is image-dense but propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“hopeful desperation turned into defiant brass”) verge on overwriting yet serve momentum. No paraphrase loops, zero dead metaphors near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-climate carnival bought by gentrifiers is familiar territory, but treatment via living murals and chip-relic compass refreshes it. Final “bid on the last dream” flips sales pitch into resistance chant, transforming trope through specificity.</comment>
