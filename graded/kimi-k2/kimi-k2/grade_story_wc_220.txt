<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bloodhound’s shift from passive observer to active translator of memory is embodied and earned; the moment he “presses his muzzle against the warm wax seal” crystallizes a cost—acceptance of a world where closeness is auditory, not territorial. Interior contradiction (yearning vs. resignation) is dramatized through scent-memory rather than summary. Grayson functions as pressure, not ornament, forcing the dog’s final stance. The pact remains largely unspoken yet legible in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the settlement “seems smaller” because the dog reconfigures distance into echo, a felt conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but traceable—each cylinder spin thickens the air until the final lullaby replaces warning. Orientation is established early by sensory cues (“heaps of slag and rust”) and held. No lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scrapyard’s micro-geography—bayonet spindle, tin roofs clicking like teeth—constrains the only possible act of listening. The amber leaf’s projection onto scrap walls charges the final image, turning setting into screen. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and sound over sight, matching the dog’s POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—tightens when the dog realizes translation requires surrendering physical return. Escalation is accumulative: each revealed scent shortens the “mileage of ash” until the final stance crystallizes. Cost is visible in the dog lying down to “dream of paths that no longer need bodies.” No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the survival of beauty as pressure, not object; the leaf’s reprojection reweights earlier monochrome without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the dog’s nostrils “flare wider than ever before”—rather than declaration. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: closeness is auditory memory, not geography. Complexity lingers; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; compression (“wild hush”) is taught early and paid off in closure. Perceptual signature is canine—scent-first, sound-second, sight-last—without anthropomorphic excess. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses for memory, fragments for immediacy. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image performs double duty (“cylinder scratches glint like blackwater snakes” conveys both visual and menace). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during revelation beats, then exhales into the final lullaby. Line-level craft supports closure without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory stored as phonograph pressure—feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Fresh synthesis of war-dog, wax cylinder, and preserved leaf transforms familiar post-apocalyptic tropes. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of scent-memory renders the concept non-transferable.</comment>
