<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ari’s sensory gift and ambition are embodied in every micro-choice; the seed’s handling, the doodle-journal, and the nightly rituals all spring from her trait-driven motive. Interiority is vivid (“taste every petal…”) and her final realization—story over soil—earns the closure with visible cost (tearing the petal). The only minor slip is the grandmother’s warning delivered as summary rather than embodied memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each layer of scent-doodle builds density until the bloom reconfigures the village’s emotional state. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—serenity exhaled in visible spirals—felt by all, with Ari’s torn petal as tangible cost. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One transition (loft → Sighing Verge) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is rendered through Ari’s nose and fingertips; cedar stairs, orchid-bark cradle, and tide-breath all constrain her ritual choices. Sensory hierarchy is strict—salt, pine, clove, thunderstorm—guiding attention. The final bloom’s scent drifting down through bridges makes the setting charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivate serenity-in-motion to awaken the seed. Escalation is textural—each nightly drop of distilled serenity thickens the wrapper until the bloom’s exhalation reweights the village’s emotional stakes. Cost is the torn, still-warm petal, foreclosing Ari’s chance to keep the whole bloom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the seed’s need for communal story rather than soil; no moral is stated. The final image—petal pressed into her journal, forever fragrant—reweights the premise that memory and shared breath are the true nutrients. Subtext operates in scent and silence, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “moonlight slides across moving water” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final balance of motionless motion. Sensory diction is character-bound; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long coils of ink vs. the hush before the bloom opens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, motion, or emotion. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—metaphors (spiral galaxy, sleeping child) serve the seed’s transformation. Final bloom description is vivid without purple drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The corpse-flower seed needing story, not soil, is a fresh inversion of growth tropes. The Night of Doodles ritual is transformed from quaint craft into living incubator. Specificity of scent-doodles and hair-tied packet makes the premise unforgettable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the resonant bloom image.</comment>
