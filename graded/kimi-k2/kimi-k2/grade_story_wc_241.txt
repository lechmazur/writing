<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured—probability equations vs. father-shaped regret—and every bench message forces a micro-choice that escalates toward the roof. The lantern’s weight as “unfinished conversation” is embodied; her laugh “like wet leaves” shows emotion without label. The final renunciation (no more betting her heart) is earned by the breadcrumb trail and costs her the illusion of control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lantern glows with remembered fire, reweighting the premise that “the house is time.” Causality is causal-lyric: each subway seat tightens the noose of memory until the roof crystallizes options. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible—she forfeits the safety of pure theory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rainwashed library is no postcard; tilted windows, puddles “like green aquariums,” and the roof’s slate expanse all constrain movement and mood. The lantern itself becomes micro-setting, its mica pane refracting light and memory. Weather and architecture guide her ascent and the final phosphorescent payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reconcile with the dead father’s contradictions without gambling her own heart. Each scrawl raises the emotional ante; the roof scene forces the decisive stance crystallization. Agency is hers—she chooses to carry the lantern up, then chooses to draft a new lecture. Cost is the acceptance of infinite deck, finite love.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: probability as love letter, time as house edge. No moralizing; the final image reframes prior motifs without dictating meaning. Subtext lives in the lantern’s borrowed fire and the unspoken apology folded in her pocket.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and character-bound—“clover melancholy,” “ghost of certainty wearing yesterday’s shoes.” Syntax modulates with pressure; rain drums “like restless chips being stacked.” No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Mara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor overwriting (“green aquariums”) is offset by sonic payoff. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of probability theory, grief, and library noir feels fresh; the subway-seat breadcrumb trail is an inventive device. Tropes (dead father, symbolic lantern) are transformed through specificity and emotional stakes. The conceptual repricing of “house edge is love disguised as time” is non-obvious and earned.</comment>
