<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Naram-Sin’s austere inner life meshes twin poles of scientific detachment and elegiac longing; every action—fasting to save oil, tracing numbered corridors—springs from that paradox. The cautious empathy earned at the climax (signed covenant, surrendered star-charts) feels inevitable yet freshly painful. Voice commands tension with ember-quiet authority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as pure earned contradiction: the tile fuses to stone, the sky turns because he gives away the right to count its turns. Causality loops through a schematic pattern that crystallizes decision into stasis. Lens holds as Situational pressure translated to metaphysical cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The malachite floor, lapis bulls with star-eyes, and whispering dusk are used both as tactile constraint (spatial choreography) and symbolic resonance in the final chamber. Details filter exclusively through Naram-Sin’s page-tight attention—no ornamental filler. Room becomes engine: floor shifts open into obsidian gears charged by his quartz lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—certainty that heaven’s gears will hold—escalates in discrete steps: scarcity, tile pattern breakthrough, covenant demand. Each turn is driven by Naram-Sin’s agency and paid with a visible, cumulative cost (star-charts surrendered, future nights owned). Pressure tightens to crystallized stance: silence and submission are the only paths left.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—knowledge requires surrender—emerges circuit-by-circuit rather than sermons: the astronomer must renounce naming to keep the cosmos spinning. Subtext pulses through inverted magic-square tiles and moonlit schematics that diagram devotion. Final image reconfigures certainty itself as perpetual tribute paid to darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited crystallizes into Naram-Sin’s wiry economy: date-pit charcoal diagrams obscure poetic sky-tinged reverie. Voice modulates with fasting clarity; long clauses collapse to spare thought under torchless ember light. Distinct perceptual signature every sentence—no break for generic filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Cracked malachite floor lapis tesserae slide cedar gears obsidian grid—each noun sparkles like shards under moonwater. Sentence pulses lean under pressure; no synonym loops, no dilution. Every clause advances or metered ember breathes available—the prose itself carries urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes star charts, ancient Babylonian rule books, mirrored magic squares into a fresh moral theorem: sacrifice vision to hold sky. Late palace transformation into perpetual dusk engine is both unsettling and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (cedar scent, cracked lens moonlight) grounds cosmic stakes in tactile grain.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Tight causality traced from thrift (mended sandals, fasting for oil) to covenant signature. Star-chart surrender locks concrete consequence into perpetually unpaid nights. Cannot swap character without rewiring entire narrative engine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Present in three beats (throne-room mapping, chamber depression, final fusion), each advance narrows options. Returns with reweighted meaning as the buried engine reveals its price and absorbs the tile forever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Shapes stakes explicitly: covenant = encrypted devotion to unknown, turning nights into perpetual darkness. Devotion isn’t abstract theme—tile geometry forces the hand of faith.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Constraint forces the final renunciation—astronomer’s empirical irony is that theory demands sacrifice of theory. Label tied to tangible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Uncloaking palace engine redefines all choices. After this beat the sky’s future depends solely on Naram-Sin’s disavowal of future star charts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Schematic grids traced across floor and walls are the only path to the chamber. Mechanics feed directly into final action—no plug-and-play alternative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Corridors curve like questions weight and walls reveal obsidian gears—spatial choreography forces direction. Setting provides the hidden engine that envelopes finale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Ambiguous time between regimes context narrows choice but doesn’t drive tactics mid-scene; textual clock is lightly present rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Desire to seal covenant dramatized as concrete risk—heft of star charts surrendered without future access clearly priced. Cannot retell the ending without this motive driving final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sustained dusky cadence across starless torchless quiet holds until final ember glow. Tone intensifies in last moment rather than static mood.</comment>
