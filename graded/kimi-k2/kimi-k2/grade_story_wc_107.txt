<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bookmark as inherited habit and talisman anchors her contradictory impulse to abandon yet now “reverse a season.” The final choice—to stay and build—earns its cost through the thawing-room metaphor and the softened bookmark, but the grandmother backstory block edges past the 20 % allowance, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s renunciation of perpetual abandonment crystallizes in the bookmark placed on the console, cost felt in “wet and gleaming and ready to be shaped.” Causal lens holds—each thawing beat tightens her resolve—yet the reflective block slightly dilutes linkage, keeping it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The control room’s dripping metal and resurrected ducts are tactile and selective; the bookmark itself becomes micro-setting that constrains her final gesture. Environment and object jointly charge the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate, though a touch more spatial anchoring in the first 120 words would have sealed 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“safe zones for inquiry”—is signaled early and tightens as each thawing beat forecloses retreat. The final commitment carries visible cost (abandoning the room to memory, not decay), but the pressure curve is more accumulative than sharply escalated, keeping it just below the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of abandonment vs. commitment emerges organically from glassblower craft and thawing ice; the ending’s image of a “molten heart” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the bookmark’s softened creases resonates more than any statement, earning the 9+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with glass-specific diction (“gather of molten glass”) and rhythmic modulation under pressure. No head-hopping; the dramatic narration device is taught early and paid off. Minor register drift toward oratory in the final address is intentional and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing image or motive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“abandoning the room not to decay but to memory”) is minor enough not to dull the closure beat, keeping it just shy of flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-climate microclimates, glassblowing, and inherited bookmarks feels fresh and inevitable. The thawing heart as literal and metaphorical kiln charge is a non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry, meriting the high originality band.</comment>
