<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory vs. surrendering it—are dramatized in the perfume-drop beat; the cost of letting go is embodied in the fading smile and heavier empty vial. Interiority stays concrete, never lapses into label-speak, and the final renunciation is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s release of the memory reweights the temple’s gift and her future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final chime dissolves the hush. Cost is legible in the instant the smile fades and the vial gains weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drowned temple is no postcard; its algae-filmed constellations and collapsing corridors constrain movement and oxygen, while the vial and altar function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; every detail is filtered through Mara’s urgent priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve one moment—is signaled early and tightened by the live oxygen clock. The single decisive turn (releasing the perfume) narrows options and exacts an on-page price: the memory vanishes, the temple grants a different future. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: surrender as power. The gardenia scent, the hush, and the empty vial reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Final image—the candle-like flicker inside her—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Mara’s—scientist’s calibration meeting grief’s synesthesia. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision (“the gathered hush”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors rising urgency, and the final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—underwater temple that stores the instinct to keep memories—feels fresh, and the inversion (surrender as activation) is earned. Specificity of gardenia scent and cracked dome prevents trope drift. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
