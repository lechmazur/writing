<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied—tears tasting of magnesium, vine etching poems onto skin—yet the centuries-long arc compresses contradictory impulses into summary rather than scene, blunting the cost of the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Resonant Reconfiguration: the postcard dissolves into violet petals, grief becomes pigment, and the armistice settles as seed. Accumulative lens holds—each lullaby layer tightens the spiral until the final image reweights memory vs. forgetting with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ammonite shell is both cathedral and cradle; its chambers constrain movement and amplify sound, while the postcard crack births constellations that charge the final hammock of night. Environment is not backdrop but active collaborator in the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn grief into beauty without erasure—escalates via cumulative intensification: each century adds a layer of melody, vine, and star-flower until the final hammock suspends the poet between memory and sleep. Cost is legible in the centuries of wakefulness and the silvered hair used for binding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of negotiated forgetting emerges organically from the spiral architecture and the postcard’s dissolution; no moral is stated, yet the final seed inside the ribs reconfigures the reader’s understanding of loss as generative rather than erosive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic and salt-stained, syntax spirals like the shell itself, and perceptual signature is consistent—every image is filtered through sleepless grief. Compression and elision (“he obeyed, planting…”) are taught early and paid off in the dream sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors braid without muddle. Occasional stacked modifiers (“reef-shadow joy”) risk purple, but pattern is purposeful and never stalls momentum. Final cadence shift into spare declarative (“He watched the sky…”) lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of grief cultivated inside a fossilized shell into living constellations is non-obvious and fully committed. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in a closure that feels inevitable yet fresh; no template echo detected.</comment>
