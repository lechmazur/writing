<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s refusal of false comfort is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (setting the bottle down, walking away). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—he leaves the only relic behind. One notch off because the “conceive a civilization” beat is slightly abstract, diluting embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the town’s inhale and the unpiloted lantern reweight the premise, making revival a collaborative act rather than a granted wish. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of memory and image tightens until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the alchemist’s solitary departure and relinquished bottle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: rotting pilings, salt wind, moonlit stage. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. One hairline slip: “splintered pier” and “rotting pilings” verge on redundant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—revival without miracles—is signaled early and tightens through the alchemist’s escalating refusal of wish-based solutions. The meaningful deepening occurs when he renounces the bottle and speaks the new covenant aloud, foreclosing the old path. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the alchemist’s embodied choices: revival as co-creation rather than gift. The final lantern rising unpiloted offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior motifs without moralizing. No thematic drift or overt thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—salt wind, crushed star-anise, spilled mercury—filtered through the alchemist’s alchemical lens. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught. One minor loop: “paper lantern” appears three times in two adjacent sentences near the opening. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information density, and no muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a ghost town revived by spoken architecture is fresh and non-obvious. The synthesis of alchemy, memory, and civic imagination feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (civilization as pop-up book) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
