<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Octavia’s contradictory impulses—obsession with legacy vs. need to erase it—are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting telescope, tasting meteorite ink). The final renunciation of the nib lands with visible cost, though the journalist’s presence dilutes interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (call → calculation → burn) links by “therefore.” Closure is a Decisive Change at 4:09 with felt cost—the satellite’s death and her tearful lightness. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s stone throat and telescope cradle actively constrain tactics; the meteorite-iron sheet becomes micro-setting that enables the proof. Clouds turning rose at dawn recharges the motif with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ending the orbit of shame—tightens via drag-coefficient calculation that forecloses any future broadcast. Cost is the lingering radar pings, proving regret fragments rather than vanishes.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt refracted through orbital mechanics emerges without statement; final image of “meteorite kiss” reweights the premise, suggesting absolution is iterative, not absolute.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—arch, tactile, astronomically precise (“magnesium heartburn”). Compression and patterned elision (“solemn yet playful”) taught early and paid off in the closing bells.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to one per beat. Minor loop: “solemnly playful” appears twice but serves cadence shift. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: scandal-as-satellite, pen-as-instrument-of-orbital-mechanics. Risky lyricism commits fully; transformation test fails if names change, proving specificity.</comment>
