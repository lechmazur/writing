<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lore-keeper’s contradictory impulses—archival rigor versus adventurous risk—fuel every beat; her micro-choice to press the ruby into stone re-orders options, while the climactic renunciation of rule (sitting to remember, not reign) earns closure cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal Situational lens sustains: “because I pressed the flake… therefore the staircase forms.” The final ascent crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (keeper becomes remembrance–warden) with felt cost—at sunrise privacy is sealed forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic waterfall, apple-skin satellites, and bioluminescent arches anchor each sensory beat; the orchard’s roots pulsing underfoot literally constrain where the stairs rise, charging the final chair imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unclaimed throne vs. memory) tightens when the orchard demands narrative steps as tribute; the sunrise clock narrows options—each footfall costs a past memory, and arrival seals revelation behind fresh paint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repeated reversals of power: monarchy abandoned, memory reclaimed, surveillance circumvented. The ending’s Conceptual Repricing frames a future where history itself is the true ruler.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is crystallized, sharply sensory, and slightly archaic (“lattice key hummed in frequencies only murals could hear”) with no POV drift. Lyric compression intensifies during ascent beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Poetic density is balanced by momentum; sentences advance story while dense, e.g. “crystallized nostalgia, warm as a sleeping cat.” Minor phrase loops (“orchard bloomed…again”) kept under cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes genre staples—monarchic dystopia, archival quest—into a single charged image. The throne itself becomes memory’s hearth; irreversible paint seal ensures no generic substitution possible.</comment>
