<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—silence vs. song—is embodied in the spectral child and the bolt plate; her micro-choices (painting the door, following the ghost) enact a credible renunciation of muteness with felt cost. The ghost-child’s plea “I was the song you stopped singing” crystallizes the internal conflict without therapy-speak. Motives remain character-bound; no knowledge leaps. The final silence “full instead of empty” earns the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each pressed flower and painted glyph layers density until the courtyard dissolves into chords. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost becomes harmony, the bolt plate now carries articulated needs, and the floating marble reseals. Cost is legible in the vanished cloak and the city below humming a tune it never knew. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by sensory cues within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The misty courtyard, bolt plate, and cloudbloom petals function as micro-setting that constrains every move: marble dissolves under song, petals become parchment memory. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—copper scent, violet sparks—guiding the final door-painting choice. Weather (lightning/thunder) paces the scene and tightens the clock. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—articulate unspoken needs—escalates as each pressed flower and painted glyph adds weight to the bolt plate. One decisive tightening: the ghost demands “Sing now before the moment closes,” forcing Lira to trade silence for song. Cost is the courtyard’s dissolution and the irreversible dispersal of the ghost into harmony. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation: silence as self-erasure vs. song as living art. The ghost-child embodies the cost of repression; the bolt plate becomes archive and instrument. Final image—sky that listens—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the static-starlight child and the humming city below.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “petals flattened into parchment-thin memory,” “clockwork birds.” Perceptual signature is Lira’s—sound, scent, metal warmth—consistent throughout. Compression and elision (“her cloak dissolving into music”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with lightning/ thunder beats and breathes during the hush. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no purple drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: balladeer encoding grief into graffiti glyphs that become living birds, ghost as un-sung self, bolt plate as memory-engine. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specificity is integral. Risk-taking (floating marble, code-ghost) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
