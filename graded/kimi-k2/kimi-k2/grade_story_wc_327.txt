<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV delivers embodied interiority and micro-choices (naming textures, lifting arms) that escalate under pressure; copper veins hardening into grammar-map is earned cost. Motivation rooted in childhood keeps stakes personal; final renunciation of ancestral resonance carries visible price. No contradictory impulses on-page, but interiority is more lyrical than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: language dies yet texture lingers, cost etched in cooled copper and healed diamond. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo thins, each translated texture hardens veins—culminating in crystallized final note. Orientation anchored by canyon lip and tunnel within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Bone towers, tunnel residue, and diamond fracture constrain every choice; canyon roof moonlight becomes literal aperture for translation. Micro-setting (veins, stone mouth) charges final image. Spatial choreography clean—footfalls trigger echoes, wings trace grammar—no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save dying language—tightens as each translated texture cools veins, foreclosing ancestral voice forever. One meaningful deepening: final murmuration condenses to single bird, forcing last syllable with irreversible cost. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through texture-to-sound translation as elegy for lost language; no moralizing. Diamond’s healed fracture and copper filigree reweight curse as instruction, resonating without statement. Final hush carries conceptual cost—ancestral resonance gone—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to storyteller’s perceptual signature—veins, textures, wing-patterns—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors pressure: long lyrical sentences compress into murmured phonemes. No register drift; diction remains within storyteller’s mythic lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language purposeful (molten seams, phonetic dust). Rhythm breathes with scene—echo thins, wings beat syllables. No mixed metaphors; closure image clear. Minor scaffold-free throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: language death translated through bird-murmuration grammar, copper veins as living lexicon. Premise fully committed; no stock tropes. Risky lyric structure pays off with earned final hush. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
