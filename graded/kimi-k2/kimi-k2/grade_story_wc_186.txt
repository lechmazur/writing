<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the retrocognitive gift is dramatized through tactile contact and painful visions. Her contradictory impulse—trusting coincidence yet fearing its cost—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (leaving the prism, following crows) is earned by prior causal chain and carries visible cost: she abandons the tower’s safety to keep the beacon alive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the beacon rekindles, the rift listens, and Elara steps into open uncertainty. Causal chain holds—each shard fracture repaired by a named loss—culminating in crystalline chime and violet fire. Cost is legible: the shard dissolves, the tower stands alone, and she walks away unarmed. Lens is Causal; every beat links because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass humming pavilion, fused tower ribs, and dunes of rust anchor every move; the shard’s violet pulse becomes micro-setting that constrains repair angles. Sensory hierarchy is urgent—wind, salt, glass hum—filtered through Elara’s retrocognitive bias. Final image of thistle-blown hope is charged by the setting’s transformation from ruin to bridge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—relight the beacon—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: each fracture demands a named loss, narrowing options until silence is spent. Agency is continuous; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Visible cost: shard dissolves, tower left defenseless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: coincidence as echoing beacon guiding survivors home. Subtext operates through image—three crows, three salt circles—culminating in “What falls together rises together” spelled by dissolving motes. No moralizing; final image reweights premise without statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers as fragile, earned hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: retrocognitive synesthesia (“colors too bright to bear”) and thistle-soft hope. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elara. Patterned elision (star angles of absence) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are fresh—“skeleton lighthouse in a land with no sea”—and physically coherent. Rhythm modulates from glass hum to crystalline chime, mirroring tension release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon myth is transformed through retrocognitive repair and star-path geometry. Specific synthesis: shard of hush absorbing silence as repair currency. Risk-taking—lyric causality, coincidence as plot engine—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
