<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. thaw—are embodied in micro-choices (touching the seed, bowing the violin) that foreclose the empire’s offer; the felt cost is the caged future she refuses. Interiority is concrete and plant-telepathy is never therapy-speak. Only the grandmother backstory drifts into summary without altering present tactics, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plant-ivy-violin imagery tightens until the final chord reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Lira’s bow stroke seeds rebellion—whose cost is legible in the “impossible midsummer snow” that cages the observatory. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The velvet observatory, midsummer starlight, and ivy ribs function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the dome becomes a hothouse, the starlight projects melting runes, the ivy offers its tendril as bow. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Only the capital-glacier backstory is briefly expositional, not scene-active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—signaled early and escalates through the violin’s harmonic answer and the coffee-islands vision. One decisive tightening: Lira’s final bow stroke forecloses the empire’s gold. Cost is visible in the snow-caged dome. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of permeable destiny emerges from the perforated prophecy and plant-root imagery; no explicit moralizing. The final lattice of melting runes reweights the premise without a thesis statement. Subtext in ivy’s sap-blood and the glacier’s forgotten names is earned and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice—mulberry ache, chlorophyll breath—sustained without register drift. Compression and patterned elision (“tasted of mulberries too ripe”) are taught early and paid off in closure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. POV modesty maintained; telepathy never over-explains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “perforated destiny” repetition is thematic, not slack. Final sentence fragment “the” is purposeful ellipsis, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transparent ice violin, plant telepathy, and destiny-as-permeability synthesize into a singular vision. The glacier’s stolen names re-emerge as lullaby-seeds—fresh, inevitable, and charged with cost. No derivative templates; risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
