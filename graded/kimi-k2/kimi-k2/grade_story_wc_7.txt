<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s contradictory impulses—grief for her grandmother’s loss vs. the imperative to plant memory—are embodied in the act of pruning; each snip releases a memory that re-weights her next choice. The final graft of the knowledge seed onto the dead vine is earned by every preceding micro-choice and carries the visible cost of renouncing simple restoration. Interiority is chef-specific (tongue, flavor, recipe) and avoids therapy-speak. One slip: “informally wise” is stated rather than dramatized in the single spoken line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse becomes a living brain, the city dreams in green, and Marisol’s refusal to rebuild but instead “grow what never was allowed” forecloses the bulldozer path with felt communal cost. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each tasted memory adds density until the final graft reconfigures meaning. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The ending beat crystallizes options without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop but active constraint: its broken glass refracts the alignment light that literally feeds the seed, and its creeping vines physically block eviction. Sensory selection is chef-biased—copper, ozone, vanilla of hope—tied to stakes. Spatial choreography is clean; the threshold where city light meets starlight is a precise pressure point. One minor drift: celestial mechanics are poetic, not literal, but the rule is consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—create beauty from ruin—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each pruning cut that trades nostalgia for future growth. Escalation is accumulative: every visitor adds a memory-seed, increasing density until the city itself is forced to dream green. The cost is the irreversible loss of the original greenhouse; no coincidence resolves. Agency remains Marisol’s graft and invitation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as consumption vs. memory as cultivation; the final fruit offered to strangers embodies this without statement. Subtext operates in gesture—the seed pulsing like a “tiny heart” carries every gardener’s dream without exposition. The ending image of the boy crying reweights all prior grief into communal possibility. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the sirens still wailing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is chef-particular: synesthetic perception (“tasted the air—copper, ozone, vanilla”) and recipe diction (“a single perfect pear glazed with defiance”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical sentences under starlight, clipped phrases when sirens intrude. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Marisol. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood,” “she felt”) but forgiven under lyric intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers flavor, memory, and consequence. Metaphors are precise—“veins of silver script” on the seed—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; every clause advances image or stakes. One near-repeat of “tasted” but offset by new sensory data. Final line is crystalline and recharges the motif of shared meals.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of synesthetic culinary memory with gentle ecological rebellion is fresh; no template plot matches this. The greenhouse-as-brain conceit is earned by gradual neural imagery. Specificity—refugee’s stolen lemon, cacao shared during rebellion—grounds universals. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final graft. No derivative echoes.</comment>
