<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity and reluctant heroism are embodied through tactile micro-choices (adjusting the hearing-aid dial, kneeling, repeating names aloud). The contradictory pull between mapping grief and becoming a conduit for the dead is dramatized in-scene; the final vow carries visible cost. Minor slip: “incidental heroism” is named rather than fully enacted, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s promise reweights her future path under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each ghost’s detail accumulates until the atrium’s atmosphere itself exhales. Cost is legible in the heavier photograph and extinguished red light. One tightening beat suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, rewired hearing aid, and sepia photograph function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“wet marble and old roses”). The bench and vines subtly guide proximity and staging. Slight over-reliance on visual mist keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting erased voices—tightens when Mara must speak each message aloud, foreclosing passive observation. Escalation is accumulative: each ghost’s plea raises the emotional ante until the vow is the only remaining option. Cost is felt in the tracer’s final dark pulse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges organically from the ghosts’ unfinished stories and Mara’s reluctant commitment. Subtext operates in gestures (transparent hand on photograph) rather than exposition. Final image of heavier photograph reweights earlier motif without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“humming like a second pulse,” “reeling hush…like damp velvet”—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays tightly anchored to Mara’s sensory filter; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“She stepped out into the city…”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and plot information. Metaphors are precise and internally coherent. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. One near-purple phrase (“folding around them like damp velvet”) barely grazes the line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” and rewired bombing-era hearing aid synthesize tech and elegy into a fresh ghost-story frame. Specificity of 1943 paper boat and telegram grounds the fantastical. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
