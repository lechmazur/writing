<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is rich and embodied—“dust regaining memory” on the tongue—but his choices remain largely observational; the final inscription is a passive summation rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Motivation is consistent yet static, lacking a contradictory impulse that would force a higher-stakes micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s return to the lectern crystallizes the stance of witness without judgment, and the cost is the slow self-composting of his own form—“crumbling in place.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each lyrical layer thickens the silence until the final image reweights it as regenerative. Orientation is taught early through sensory anchors, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library’s breathing vines and sweating stone are not mere backdrop; they constrain movement and mirror the keeper’s decay, charging the final image of “composted syllables.” The obsidian cube functions as micro-setting that literally folds space, shaping the only tactical option—burrowing. Specificity is vivid, selective, and causally integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving silence without judgment—tightens once when the keeper releases seasons into the hush, but the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The cost is diffuse (his own slow dissolution) rather than a discrete price paid at a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between witness and erasure; the regenerative silence reweights memory itself as fertile ground rather than archive. The final inscription offers a non-literal answer—“it tasted of dust regaining memory”—that resonates without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is singular, textured, and sustained—“copper-green vines,” “paper lungs”—with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to hush. Compression and elision are taught early (folded text, origami mechanics) and paid off at closure. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains coherent under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cities bloom and wither inside dewdrops”) risk overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; grammar and tense are flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami portal, regenerative silence, and self-composting archive feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; the vision is singular.</comment>
