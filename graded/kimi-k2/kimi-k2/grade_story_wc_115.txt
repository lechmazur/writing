<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—skeptic who still fingers a Saint Jude medal—drives every micro-choice; the moment she grips the wheel and feels Jonah’s guilt as literal weight crystallizes her arc with visible cost. The swallowed-truth motif anchors motive and emotional embodiment without therapy-speak. Only the brother remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the wheel reweights the premise that guilt is measurable and transferable. Causal chain—confession → tunnel → wheel → numerals → release—holds without gaps; the 21-gram payoff is earned. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel’s cold exhalation and beaded brass wheel function as micro-setting that literally constrains Mara’s choice to turn or retreat. Sensory triage (oil, coal, wet-cotton regret) is filtered through her explorer priorities. Final image of dawn bleeding across rails recharges the palette and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measure the weight of Jonah’s swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightened when the numerals appear. One decisive turn of the wheel narrows options and forces Mara to bear then release the mass; cost is the palpable heat transferred to her palms. Escalation is causal and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ledger conceit: unspoken guilt accrues mass until externalized. Subtext lives in the beads-as-rosary echo and the scanner’s translation of psychic panic into grams. Final image reframes the Saint Jude medal from luck to ballast without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Voice is tactile, skeptical, and lyrically compressed—“dust on rusted rails,” “smell of wet cotton and regret.” Perceptual signature remains consistent; no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses during reflection, staccato beats at the wheel turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or motive. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective—“gravity bending toward the alcove like a confessional”—and serves the final reconfiguration. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<comment>The factory-ghost-shift-as-ledger is a fresh synthesis of hauntology and moral accounting; the beaded valve wheel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the psychic-call overlay pays off by literalizing guilt in grams. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
