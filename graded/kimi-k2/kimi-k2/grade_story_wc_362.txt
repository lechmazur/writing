<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's arc is specific—vision of driver’s fear refracted through prism redefines her hypothesis—but interior voice occasionally slips into lyrical exposition rather than prising open contradiction under visible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single scene holds tight causal chain: frost trauma → prism translation → acceptance. Assumed lens is Textural/Accumulative; density and cadence shift at end earn a Resonant Reconfiguration with perceptible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quartz arbor—mist, crystalline branches, porous bark—functions as pressure field and archive; small object setting (prism, car window) constrains optic physics and emotional transfer, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving emotions absorbed objects; tightened by prism rendering driver's fear and arbor's pooled grief; payoff crystallizes renunciation with felt loss when prism is relinquished.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from specific mechanics of absorption/return; final image of frost reforming into acceptance offers non-literal answer without moralizing, weighted by cost of surrendering prism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual filter—fractal language older than regret—maintains rhythmic control; minor template cadence in lines on “shatter” repetition, but elision of transition between beat 3-4 is intentional lyric rip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft shows vivid sensory economy, no loops; metaphor density peaks safely within pattern and payoff; rhythm rises toward visceral climax without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle on emotional physics through objects; prism used not as symbol but as instrument; any risk alternates lyric and causality clearly without distortion.</comment>
