<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tatiana’s contradictory impulses—duty vs love—are embodied in the violet fingertips and deliberate heartbeat; the final act of broadcast is earned by prior stealth and carries visible social cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “bravely conflicted” is once label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change: the genocide files now stream across public kiosks, irreversible. Causal chain—override terminal → expose files → erase login—holds under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the crimson trigger and the siren too late to matter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cryo-vault’s −31°C air literally constrains every breath and stylus move; the “echoing library under snow” reappears in the pink-tinted dawn, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—broadcast the contraband truth—tightens once when Tatiana chooses mass exposure over personal safety. Escalation is causal: each override step narrows escape until the files are loose. Price is the irreversible scandal and her own exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silenced genocide emerges through the letter’s chemical trigger and the public red text; no moralizing, only the resonant image of pink snow. The final whisper “He said speak so I spoke” reweights the premise without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, frost-bitten, with rhythmic control (“metronome for the dizzying quiet”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop: “dizzying quiet” appears twice without added pressure. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cryo-archive espionage and genocide confession; the crimson trigger and cinnamon hunger are specific, non-oblique details. Risky choice to hinge climax on data breach is fully committed and coherent.</comment>
