<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing chalk, pressing the warm square—that escalate to irreversible commitment; the final whispered line crystallizes her cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “oddly stranded” abstracts what the body already shows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the island’s coordinates are inked, the airship turns, and the phrasebook’s glow seals the cost. Causal chain (phrasebook → hopscotch → lens → island) holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; lens ambiguity is zero.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The antique airship, moonlit cargo hold, and starling sky are filtered through Liora’s cartographer gaze; each detail constrains her next move. The warm center square and refracting lens function as micro-settings that charge the final image. One stray “living calligraphy” edges purple but is earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“chart the next great discovery”—is tested by Captain Rens’s warning and crystallized when Liora chooses the unmarked island. Escalation is one tightening spiral; cost is the crew’s unknown fate. Coincidence (starlings) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of rescued light emerges from concrete objects (phrasebook, lens, starlings) without moralizing. Final whisper reweights the premise: the seeker becomes the map. Complexity lingers—curiosity’s sail may still wreck them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from hushed wonder to hammering pulse. Perceptual signature—“measured cloud shadows against coastline shadows”—is sustained. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Rhythm accelerates with the tilt of the airship. One mixed metaphor—“luminance switched off inside her mind”—is minor amid high yield.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: starling murmuration as living cartography, hopscotch as cipher, stranded light as island. Risky lyricism pays off in a closure image that feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
