<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—warrior’s secrecy vs. caretaker’s openness—play out in embodied micro-choices (hiding the bullet, cradling the amber). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits sealed certainty for negotiated destiny. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “destiny is a seed” leans toward label-speak, though it’s embedded in an object.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber opened, the embryo breathes, tradition renegotiated. Causal chain holds—kite message → reeds’ guidance → unsealing—each step narrowing options. Cost is legible in the elders’ protest and the mountain’s approving rumble. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Hot springs, obsidian shelf, and petrified wood constrain every move; heat scorches knees, ferns shield face. The amber sphere functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. No static postcarding; each detail alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep destiny sealed or evolving—is signaled early and tightened once: unsealing the amber forecloses the elders’ fixed path. Escalation is causal and driven by Lila’s agency; cost is the rupture with tradition. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory and possibility must negotiate, not dictate. The final image of the embryo’s first breath reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the plants’ silence and the mountain’s murmurs. No thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—weather-wise ferns, “chlorophyll courage,” sulfur-and-pine breath. Syntax modulates with heat and pressure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Lila. Dialogue is sparse but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, amber embryo, and volcanic reconstruction interlock into a singular vision. The kite-script decoding feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choices—plant voices, embryo negotiation—heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
