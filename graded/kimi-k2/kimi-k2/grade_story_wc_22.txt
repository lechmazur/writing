<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Coachman’s layered contradictions—former driver of soldiers now ferrying silence, seed-planter who speaks only dead languages—embody both mourning and agency. Interiority is vivid in micro-decisions (kneeling to press ash into the crater, listening to gulls for rain), and his final smile at the blooming battlefield earns its cost against prior grief. Motives remain consistent: bind the dead reef’s memory through the living garden. The earned stasis of remaining “until the last light” without the coach ever leaving the jetty crystallizes the character arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught from blooming jetty→battlefield→returning tide, each image growing denser until the garden reclaims the scar. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flowers shift from purple to gold under the rising tide, reconfiguring meaning with felt maternal and ecological cost. Every beat tightens texture toward final radiance without causal turns yet achieves undeniable emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Blooming jetty” and battle-scarred earth anchor instantly; coral bones and mortar craters act as micro-settings that steer seed-sowing patterns. Oleanders under which the coachman sleeps, tide-scented soil—all constrain choice and charge the final golden garden. Only minimal lapse: reef-death exposition drifts toward summary rather than sensory, but it recurs in the heron-guided seed placement, rescuing specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore biotic harmony to poisoned ground—is signaled at “fertilize the battlefield.” Each sowing and animal response tightens the task: gulls prescribe watering rhythms, heron traces the readiness circle. Cost accrues in maternal ash and final lost language relinquished into tide. Only reservation: the “submerged concord” itself emerges late without earlier agency impact, trimming escalation peaks to merely vivid pattern-completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme is burial-as-rebirth, voiced through language layers: Latin requiem answered by Greek return. No moralizing; the blooming battlefield itself rebuts glorification of war. Last coral seed binding tide-to-garden crystallizes the theme without abstract statement. Minimal drift: “narrow vastness” label late in text slightly echoes rather than emerges but fits within lyric compression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice achieves mythic compression—ceremonial syntax, dead language echoes—yet stays coherent to coachman’s solitary mourning mind. Rhythm swells and ebbs with tides and heartbeat. One small slip: “narrow vastness” floats toward abstraction without immediate anchoring image. Overall tone remains specific and sustained through all beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is exemplary: “plank still warm from the day’s last sun” or “petals the same bruised purple as the sky before a storm” deliver dual sensory and symbolic payload. Occasional slight poetic stack (“saltweed and sorrow”) is contained within rhythmic pattern and does not cloud momentum. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks. Precision carries to the closing “glowed”. Minor repetition of seed actions could tighten by one beat but not at clarity cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Conceptual fusion of cemetery-coachman as literal earth-renewer, gardening via extinct tongues, is fresh and memorable transformation of “gardener” archetype. Tropes of aftermath-battlefield bloom are renovated through seed pods tied to maternal ashes. Single echo risk: battlefield flower motif familiar but saved by coral reef binding. Sustained specificity prevents default into cliché.</question>
