<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s drive, interior friction, and embodied choices feel vivid; micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values. However, the elders and children remain off-stage sketches rather than crucible, slightly diluting relational stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural arc builds through repeated sensorial pressure, then crystallizes in the Earned Stasis of the viaduct surfacing—no hammers needed. Closure lands with undeniable reconfiguration of town options and Elara’s departure with “softly purposeful” cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Basalt, frost, lake ice, moon glare, and compass needles constrain every tactic; the viaduct’s buried rails literally shape the fracture pattern. These material anchors physically reconfigure in the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“unyoke the town from its panic”—tightens with lunar pressure and compass lurches until cracks surface the rails; the visible price is town-wide wonder replacing flight. One deliberate deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Ambition versus patient transformation unfolds through ice and iron imagery without ever articulating a moral; final laughter and quiet tears echo the thematic answer non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect lyricism (“restrained wildness: thunder wearing mittens”) sustains a vivid, selective perceptual signature from first frost-breath to final footprint. Compression and metaphorical logic taught at open remain legible in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary rhythm, information-dense; figurative strings serve pattern and payoff—only mild overgrowth (“moonlit heartbeat beneath the world”). Close call below artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing geologic violence with quiet civic renewal—rails surfacing without hammer blows—feels fresh and earned. No close echoes to famous scenes; the internal synthesis holds.</comment>
