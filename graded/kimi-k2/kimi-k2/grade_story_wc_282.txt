<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory imperatives—preserving versus releasing the unknown—are embodied in the fossil’s final fusion; renunciation feels earned. Interiority remains character-specific (sensor trembles, not abstract labels) and flaws (her passivity at threshold) compel the ending. The visible cost—she is mapped in gold and left voiceless yet responsible—scales to micro-fiction and resonates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The accumulating emotional residue tightens stakes until the final spiral reconfigures purpose. Closure is Charged Poise: the sleeper rises, fossil scar glowing, caves seal; cost is legible in Lira’s lost control and the blank map. Causality remains intact; no props teleport.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Immediate anchoring of who/where/time via salt wind on step 1. The fossil-as-micro-setting constrains the climactic choice by literally welding into flesh. Selective sensory density (tide heartbeats, limestone warmth) integrates rather than stalls.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: give voice to the unknown. Pressure intensifies with each emotional color pulse and narrows at the fork—she chooses to surrender authorship. The final spiral forecloses her map-maker agency; price is palpable—loss of personal map and future narrative control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of listening-as-creation emerges organically; image of inverse-falling leaves reweights earlier motifs without overt moralizing. Final “voice travels forward by listening back” is delivered via blank screen rather than stated epiphany, satisfying non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical texture: compressed, sensory verbs, rhythmic ocean pulse mirrored in syntax. POV stays strictly Lira; no leakage. Micro turns marked by sentence breath-length shifts match cave narrowing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>High density: every line double-loads world building and emotion (“grief becoming coral”). Minor drift toward poetic inventory in mid-section but never obfuscates cause/effect; no loops within closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Synthesis is fresh: post-hibernation cartography via fossilized empathy. No template match. Transitional-object trope is subverted—the map is the dreamer, not the map-maker—risk heightens stakes without obscuring.</comment>
