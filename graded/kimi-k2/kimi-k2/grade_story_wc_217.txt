<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"tasted salt and storm," "knees stippled with sand"—but the poet’s contradictory impulses (cling vs release) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is earned by the kite-string memory and the spiral’s erasure, with the felt cost of accepting perpetual incompleteness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of tending small disorders builds to the word “unfinished” and the feather’s final role as compass. Closure is a Charged Poise—the widening space after the inner string snaps—whose cost is the ongoing labor of tending the frayed. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, wet sand, tide’s metronome are vivid and selective; the feather and spiral of broken shells act as micro-setting that constrains her choices and charges the final image. Weather shift from hush to molten copper mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with incompleteness—is signaled early via the snapped kite string. Escalation is accretive: each act of tending (crab, kelp, gulls) tightens the pattern until the spiral’s erasure forces the stance crystallization. Cost is the acceptance of endless, visible in the dissolving footprints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-incompletion emerges organically from shell fragments, frayed feather, and unfinished letter; no moralizing. Final image—“carrying the incomplete as one carries a seashell to the ear”—offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature: selective sensory detail, rhythmic cadence that breathes with tide. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Purposeful elision (“the word remained, floating somewhere between eye and memory”) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Molten copper across the lagoon” and “feather caught fire without burning” are precise and earned. Minor risk of overwriting in “burnished hush,” but does not stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar lyric shoreline setting is transformed through the specific lens of tending incompleteness; the drake feather as heartbeat-quill and loom-of-dawns synthesis feel fresh. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in the final widening space.</comment>
