<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The investigator’s interiority is spare but embodied—her gait adjusts to the shifting maze, her fingers release silk to map breath. Motivation (“cultivate foresight”) is dramatized when she volunteers to tend the sphere, trading places with Mara at visible cost. The patch’s return as a “badge of borrowed duty” crystallizes a micro-choice that forecloses retreat. Minor: we never feel her flaws or limits; she adapts too smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: slamming the doors at the violet flare folds the sphere and restores the town’s noise—a decisive change with felt cost (Mara’s exile ended, investigator now bound). Causal chain is tight: ribbon → recoiling air → container → sphere → doors → silence/noise. One transition (investigator ↔ Mara) is legible. No orientation debt; anchors set by line 3. Lens holds causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is tactile—salt-stained concrete, corrugated walls, swinging bulb—yet always filtered through the investigator’s goal-directed attention. Silk ribbon and bulb cord become micro-settings that constrain tactics: ribbon snaps, bulb bursts, cueing the final act. Weather (tide, wind) is causal, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent the sphere from swallowing more reality. Pressure escalates via ribbon tension, bulb burst, violet contraction—each beat narrows options. Investigator’s agency drives every turn: she proposes the trade, times the slam, pays with open-ended guardianship. Cost is visible—Mara sleeps, investigator stays awake—though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: foresight as rhythmic attunement to hidden breathing worlds. Patch resewn “wings now whole” reweights memory into responsibility without moralizing. Subtext in the sphere’s pulse—every door swing trades silence for gulls—carries ecological and ethical resonance. Final image of “letters in a sentence finally completed” offers quiet conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, maritime, slightly numinous—“bruise-blue dawn,” “metal lung”—yet stays within investigator’s perceptual range. No head-hopping; Mara’s speech is brief, distinct. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer cadences in calm, clipped fragments at climax. Compression is taught early (“hazy precision”) and paid off in the final swing of the bulb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, high-density: “flashlight cone drifting like a lazy lighthouse beam” does triple duty (image, pacing, POV). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled; mixed metaphors avoided. Sentence variety supports breathless tightening. One typo risk—“salt-stained” hyphen—but clarity intact. Final line lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Freight-container-as-quantum-labyrinth is fresh; folding a ship into a marble-sized probability sphere feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (vanished town, lone guardian) are transformed through tactile port detail and ecological metaphor. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity throughout prevents generic drift.</comment>
