<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority blooms in concrete threads: the unnamed narrator’s guilt-laced curiosity about the ghost mail anchors every escalating choice. Flaws—courtship hesitancy, architectural longing—compound into real stakes. The final acceptance of the seal’s weight proves earned and irrevocable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens, letting atmospheric pressure mount until the rooftop melts into centuries. Closure lands with a Charged Poise: the seal brands the sternum, the wall answers in Morse, and the conversation becomes mutual interrogation. Cost is seared into skin and stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sparse, exact detail: cedar scent on wax, verbena in tin cans, cornices flexing like eyebrows. The rooftop garden meteor shower is not backdrop but oracle, constraining the final communal interrogation. Sensory hierarchy mirrors escalating awe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fluency in the language of old buildings—escalates brick by brick. The borrowing sugar → weekly tea sessions frame a credible interval, the meteor shower tightens the night until the city exhales dust and stories. The seal’s heat brands memory, a final trade-off visible on skin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The agreed-upon lies motif moves from polite first exchange to final cosmic grammar: language is mostly made of lies that outlast their liars. No tidy moral; resonance crystalizes in the seismic Morse from parapets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct cadence: patient, nimble, wise-cracking tutors sound in mortar. Non-standard punctuation shows consistent intent; the wife’s murmured “Second lesson is interrogation” carries subtext that lands the final inversion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Percussion of percussion is purposeful: bricks conjugate futures, meteors spell syllables. Zero loops, every sentence advances. The branded promise in the pocket compresses origin and ending into one resonant clause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The mysterious-familiar tone reframes ghost tutors as architectural syntax—neither gimmick nor trope. Synthesis makes the city itself both teacher and text; the final “welcome to the conversation” is an earned inversion of agency.</comment>
