<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysandra’s contradictory impulses—intellectual detachment vs. visceral need to bury the overture—surface in micro-choices (aligning needles, flipping the card). The envoy’s diplomatic ferocity pressures her into the final renunciation, costing her the secrecy she once guarded. Interiority is embodied in brass clicks and gear-song rather than labels. The mechanical arm is more ornament than flaw, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the envoy realizes questions were “for the silence after,” reweighting the entire duel. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each needle shift and parry layers density until the card’s underside reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in Lysandra’s lowered foil and the envoy’s deeper bow. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The glass atrium, sundial, and brook are not backdrop but instruments: the sundial’s coded angles steer tactics, the brook’s reflection projects constellations onto palms at closure. Micro-setting (needle card, mechanical arm) constrains choices. Sensory detail is selective—fractured light, brass clicks—filtered through Lysandra’s precise priorities. Environment charges the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning questions into destinations—tightens via each parry and needle shift. Escalation is Accumulative: pattern density increases until the card flip reweights the premise. Cost is felt in Lysandra’s relinquishment of secrecy and the envoy’s trembling blade. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the duel’s choreography: destinations are questions exhausted by asking. Subtext lives in silence, coded angles, and the unfinished sundial. The ending’s non-literal answer—“depart together”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity lingers: sovereignty as melody or silence remains unresolved yet resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise, metallic, philosophical—sustained through brass-and-sunlight diction. POV stays locked in Lysandra; envoy’s interiority is inferred only through gesture. Rhythm modulates with combat intensity; no head-hopping. Compression (“gears sang”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “sunlight fractured,” “dignified chaos,” each image doing double duty. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Syntax accelerates during the duel, breathes during the kneel. Final line resolves by image, not exposition. Minor elevation in diction is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fencing-as-conversation, coded sundial, and mechanical philosopher synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. The hidden overture compressed into a sewing-needle card is a non-obvious yet earned device. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
