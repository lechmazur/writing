<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hourglass turner’s interiority is embodied and specific; contradictions surface in her quiet awe versus urgent task. Micro-choices—selecting buttons, pressing the seed pearl—reveal value hierarchy and cost. Final renunciation (leaving jar open, scattering buttons) is earned by prior causality with visible emotional price. Slight reserve: no secondary character on page limits relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): spindle dissolves into future buttons, reweighting prophecy as open question. Causality intact: each catalogued button tightens echo toward final spiral. Cost legible in dawn release and cliff-face shift. No orientation debt; pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber warehouse walls, heated sap scent, and resinous light constrain movement and mood. Buttons as micro-setting objects directly shape the ritual and final reconfiguration. Cliffs outside mirror internal release; warehouse softens to wax, charging closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: spin prophecy before echo fades. Pressure escalates via each button’s syllable, tightening time to dawn. Final choice—seed pearl into spindle—forecloses personal claim and releases possibility to future. Cost visible in emptied jar and altered cliffs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom as shared fragments, not possession. Subtext carried by buttons’ histories and final scattering. Question “What will you weave?” resonates without moralizing. Ending reweights prophecy from sentence to open invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: sap, resin, moth-wing cadence. POV stable, perceptual signature consistent. Compression and elision taught early (“truth unravels in the hush between breaths”) and paid off. No dialogue, so voice judged on narrative texture alone—exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern and closure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with urgency. Minor elevated diction (“resinous walls,” “petrified waves”) fits lyric mode and remains legible. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hourglass that runs upward, buttons as syllables of prophecy, warehouse as living archive. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens. Transformation test: story fails if elements swapped. Bold yet inevitable.</comment>
