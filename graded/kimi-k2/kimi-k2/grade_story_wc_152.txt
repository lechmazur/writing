<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—foolish mask vs. lethal intent—are dramatized in every micro-choice (needle-prick cipher, giggle to mislead). The final renunciation of her own stitched future is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (blood-star beacon). Interiority is embodied and specific; no diagnostic label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the folded chart beneath the lens reweights the entire coup timeline with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—each stitch and unstitch is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until the candle’s nod consummates the plan. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt dome, eternal candle, and embroidered cloth function as micro-settings that constrain every choice: the candle’s flame direction dictates timing, the cloth’s folds become escape routes. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“leaves scraping the dome like dry wings.” Environment charges the final image when dawn light ignites the beacon. Only the cliff itself remains slightly ornamental, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finish the chart before the coup—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the flame leans east. One decisive turn: unstitching conspiracies into escape routes, paid for with blood and time. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is visible (three drops of blood, sleepless night) and alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of wisdom disguised as foolishness emerges organically from Mira’s every action; no direct statement. The final image—a candle flame cradled in an open hand—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about future custodianship. Subtext operates in silence, blood-ciphers, and the candle’s flicker. Complexity lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: “silver thread trembling like starlight,” “echoed silence pressed like deep water.” Perceptual signature is Mira’s—selective, tactile, conspiratorial. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with stress. Patterned elision (unheard stories) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during unstitching—“She embroidered faster now”—then breathes at the end. Figurative language is precise and purposeful; no purple drift. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—embroidered star-maps as living conspiracy charts—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names or places change; specificity is non-negotiable. Risk-taking (invisible-thread future gift) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
