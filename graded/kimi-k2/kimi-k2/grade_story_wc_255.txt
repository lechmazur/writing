<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—longing for color yet trading memory—are embodied in her tactile sorting of glass and ivy; the final acceptance of blurred edges feels earned because every micro-choice (tucking the reed beneath the leaf, tasting metal) visibly costs her. Calder’s pressure is immediate and status-legible, but his interiority remains opaque, capping the relationship crucible at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single clear note cracks the air and reweights the premise—beauty is imperfection awakened inside her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each arrangement of stems and shards intensifies pattern until the courtyard itself sings, with the felt cost of surrendered memories legible in the tears she cannot color-code.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard’s glass shards, living vines, and furnace heat constrain every choice; the cracked indigo marble and warmed reed tongue function as micro-settings that charge the final dome. Spatial choreography is exact—ivy braiding into frame, Calder stepping back across splintered reflections—anchoring the lyric escalation without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—tightens through each trade; the spiral of shoots and shards visibly raises the cost of awakening. One decisive intensification suffices: the reed’s note cracks the air, foreclosing the path of color-seeing and crystallizing the stance of cherishing cracks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: imperfection as aperture for light. The ivy-framed reed tongue reprises the opening ember-seeds, reweighting them from loss to generative wound. No moral is stated; the final dome’s forever-broken growth offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—feeling color as heat and fracture—remains consistent; syntax breathes with her wonder (“tasted of iron and cherries”). Calder’s rough diction (“Trade what?”) contrasts without convergence. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the courtyard exhaled” compresses setting and response. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors or loops. Final image—“forever growing, forever broken”—crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The colorblind painter who sculpts with living plants to barter awakenings is a fresh synthesis; the cracked-glass aesthetic and phoenix cycle feel inevitable, not ornamental. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
