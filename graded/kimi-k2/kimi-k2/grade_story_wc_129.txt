<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior ache is embodied (“luminescent… pulsed”) and her contradictory desire for solitude vs. witness is dramatized through the weaving act; the final micro-choice (carving the reed) crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Fen and the newcomers apply immediate relational pressure, but secondary voices blur slightly. No unmotivated leaps.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor becomes “a living document” and the Circle’s vows foreclose Lira’s solitary path with visible communal embrace. Causal chain (search → find glyph → co-create) holds; no orientation debt. One smooth transition onto the causeway.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Crater, obsidian causeway, and glass orchard are filtered through Lira’s sculptor gaze; the arbor’s lattice literally constrains the final weaving and recharges the “cupped hands” image at closure. Sensory economy favors tactility over catalog. Spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness vs. kinship—tightens when the glyph appears and communal additions foreclose solitary retreat. Agency is collaborative weaving; cost is the irreversible gifting of her reeds and identity to the Circle. No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of chosen kinship emerges through the arbor’s transformation from tag to shared heart; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “you were expected” reweights earlier loneliness without stating a thesis. Subtext in Fen’s whisper and Lira’s hidden reed signature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays close to Lira’s perceptual palette (“fingers still smelling of peat and salt”). Syntax flexes with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Dialogue sparse but goal-driven (“Now we are the tag”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“glassy minerals that sang”) is selective and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“graft,” “threaded”) and varied cadence support momentum. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: street-art tag as communal covenant, marsh-reed sculptor as medium, crystalline orchard as resonant crucible. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the translucent heart image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
