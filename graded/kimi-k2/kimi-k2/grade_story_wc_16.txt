<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s three-month silence and the “carefully reckless” trait are embodied in her deliberate shattering of the ink well; the interior contradiction between fear and defiance is dramatized through micro-choices (writing promises, guiding melody to Arden). Cost is visible: she breaks the vessel that gave her power, accepting fragility. Relationship with Arden shifts from adversary to co-guardian under pressure. Minor slip: Councilman’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s status flips from doomed to protected, the ink well’s emptying marks cost, and the final communal utterance “Listen” crystallizes the new stance. Causal chain holds: promises encoded in ink → audible chords → tablets’ glow → Arden’s reversal. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options until demolition is averted. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive’s cedar scent, floating dust, and glowing glyphs are selective and purposeful; the glass ink well functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice. Spatial choreography is clean—lectern, aisles, threshold—guiding the procession of promises. Final image of plaza learning “Listen” recharges the archive as living conservatory. Slight excess lyricism in “dust floated like slow constellations” but it serves tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archive survival—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: demolition crews arrive, forcing Arden’s public reversal. Cost is the spent ink and shattered well; trust must now be “kept performing.” Agency lies in Lira’s encoded promises and Arden’s live choice. No coincidence resolves; music and tablets earn the reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust as living symphony emerges from concrete acts: promises sung, silence broken, ink sacrificed. Subtext in Arden’s wrist-touch and the final shard-chime avoids moralizing. Final image reweights silence from weapon to seed of future language. Complexity preserved: councilman’s deceit acknowledged yet redeemable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s linguistic ear (“unheard music,” “roots of their thoughts”). Rhythm modulates with tension—long cadences in lamplight, staccato shards at dawn. No head-hopping; Arden’s shift is shown externally. Compression like “Fear is just silence with teeth” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and stakes. Metaphors are controlled—violet melody, cautious exuberance—never crowding causality. Minor purple tinge in “tasting like starlight” but it lands within character voice. No loops or scaffold; fragments at closure serve cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magical ink that transmutes deceit into audible promises, extinct language as living covenant. Tropes of last-night-save-the-library and redeemed politician are transformed through sonic magic and communal pedagogy. Risky shattering of the well pays off by making trust performative. Specificity of Aelvaric and violet ink makes premise irreplicable.</comment>
