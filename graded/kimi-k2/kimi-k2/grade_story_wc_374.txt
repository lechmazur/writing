<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (tasting wind, metal memory) and motives clear, but the skeptic’s shift to “no longer a skeptic” feels compressed; more contradiction in-scene would raise this. Embodied emotion (ring warming, taste of bergamot) supports character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the merged season and dissolved ring reconfigure stakes with felt cost (“the weather is no longer mine alone”). Causal chain (ring → Mara → convergence) holds; one transition (cliff to bluff center) is clean. Orientation is early and stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and floating compass function as micro-settings that constrain movement and choice; the aurora’s dimming charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (taste, scent, light) is POV-filtered and purposeful. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent Mara’s grief-flood—is signaled early and tightened by the forest’s vote. One meaningful turn: convergence dissolves the ring and balances the storm. Cost is visible (loss of private weather, shared burden).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of shared atmospheric responsibility emerges through action (ring sacrifice, forest vote) without moralizing. Final image of “ordinary stars” reweights prior aurora-awe into quiet accountability. Subtext in taste-language and star-chart coat sustains resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—metallic tastes, synesthetic weather, neon nostalgia—remains consistent under pressure. No POV leakage; free indirect style is clean. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven (“May our atmospheres converge without casualty”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>High density with rhythmic variation; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional stacked metaphors (“terrestrially cosmic note”) flirt with excess but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; closure image is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of taste-based navigation and personal weather is fresh; star-chart coat and forest suffrage transform familiar eco-fantasy. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
