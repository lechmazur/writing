<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her chant, gait, and tactile handling of the rag knot reveal contradictory impulses (defiance vs. playfulness) that culminate in the cannon choice. The final renunciation—turning weapon into bouquet—earns its cost through prior causality and visible flame. Minor: no second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cannon blast births new stars, reweighting the “night with no stars” premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the cadence shift at the turret. Cost is legible in the spent rag and the fortress’s altered state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The blooming fortress is not backdrop; its stone petals, mosaic lock, and cannon mouth constrain every move. Micro-setting (rag on mosaic) literally unlocks the plot. Final image of petals “opening wider” recharges the setting as living participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened when the mosaic demands the rag. One decisive intensification: stuffing the cannon forecloses weapon use and seeds stars. Cost is the rag itself and the fortress’s irreversible bloom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: light vs. forgetting, hope as ascending fuse. Final non-literal answer—“Return when the stars forget again”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the cannon’s transformation from war to wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “sparks learning to speak,” “petals made of flame.” POV remains tight; perceptual signature filters every detail through Liora’s fire-maker senses. No head-hop; compression and elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—flame metaphors escalate to literal stars. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final paragraph breathes after the blast.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fireworks designer as mythic star-seeder. Transforms familiar “light in darkness” trope through specific craft knowledge and tactile ritual. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
