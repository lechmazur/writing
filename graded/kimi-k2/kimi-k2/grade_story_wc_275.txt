<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s pacifist stance and continuity drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices (burying canvas, grafting cuttings) that foreclose violence; the final gift of the rose is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory—she both fears and understands her father’s possible arrival. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“continuity was not the same as loyalty”) that slightly blurs the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the boy flees with the rose, the dome cracks, and Lila listens to sap—an earned stasis that reconfigures options with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “quiet” deepens from engraved silence to listening. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass dome, sandbag soil, and patriarch rose constrain every choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the dome’s fracture catches light like frost, directly shaping the ending. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve continuity through tending roses—tightens when scavengers arrive. One meaningful deepening: offering the rose as ceasefire narrows options and carries visible social cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of continuity versus violence emerges through concrete acts (grafting, gifting) rather than statement. Final image of listening sap reweights “quiet” from absence to active receptivity. No moralizing; resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—Lila notices humidity shifts and iron-blood scent. No POV drift; diction stays within her lexicon. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught. Final third remains clean.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist bounty-hunter’s daughter tending weaponized roses grown from airship ballast. Tropes transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
