<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“lungs still bargaining with air”), but the protagonist’s choices remain largely observational until the final image; the shift to “become the space between stories” is resonant yet feels slightly unearned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the death certificate dissolves and the label curls into a boat, reweighting survival as custodianship of erased histories. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragment gathered layers into the final chord—cost is the surrender of personal name/identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Port container labyrinth is tactile and constraining; the poison-label’s almond scent literally tints perception, charging the final door-sketching beat. Environment and object together steer every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving existence beyond administrative death—tightens through accumulating fragments until the final reconfiguration. One clear escalation: label warms, sketches door, jars of sound revealed; cost is loss of fixed identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from the custodial act; no moralizing, only the resonant image of “wet and gleaming” histories ready to be touched. Final reweighting feels inevitable yet open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, salt-stained, and lyrically compressed; perceptual signature consistent (“sepia so the present looks like a damaged photograph”). Patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“cranes bow like praying mantises”) verge on excess but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; final cadence crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of bureaucratic death error transformed into living archive of forgotten stories feels fresh; synthesis of port logistics and metaphysical custodianship is non-obvious and fully committed.</comment>
