<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradiction between myth-busting profession and personal hunger for mythic truth is embodied in her micro-choices under cello pressure; interiority remains concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Ephemeral compass as state of being” lands as closure (Conceptual Repricing) with felt knowledge shift; causal chain from cello vibration to seashell glow forces cost-based renunciation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral-compass payoff and cello-as-medium angle are fresh syntheses, though seashell seashell seashell rhythmic echo nicks originality.</comment>
