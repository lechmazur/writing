<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his fingers trembled”), but the borrowed-personality trait is asserted rather than dramatized; the final shift to “threads in a larger tapestry” is earned yet slightly abstract. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the cost of empathy overload is more told than shown in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance toward empathy crystallizes with felt cost (“he carried with him the faint glow”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of merging voices tightens to a single charged image. Orientation is secure by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Topaz workshop and open sky are sketched with selective sensory detail; the halo fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Stars fading serve as live clock, integrating time and place into pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering the mathematics of emotion—tightens when overload threatens identity. One clear escalation: the surge of foreign emotions forces Elias to stagger back, narrowing options. Cost is visible but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as boundary-expansion emerges organically from Elias’s experiment; final image reweights earlier borrowed masks without moralizing. Subtext in the chorus of voices is effective, though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation matching emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is distinct—“lucid turbulence,” “sanctuary of lucid turbulence”—and sustained. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and purposeful; occasional elevated phrasing (“mathematics of emotion”) fits the POV’s obsession. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum maintained. One minor scaffold: “as if he were becoming a vessel” could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of empathy-as-code feels fresh; synthesis of letterpress craft and cosmic artifact is specific and non-obvious. Risk in blending mysticism and mechanics pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
