<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grip on the clipboard, the tremor in her voice—but the “price of redemption” is asserted more than embodied; no single micro-choice visibly costs her a concrete piece of herself. The leaders remain silhouettes, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. Still, her final renunciation of pure diplomacy earns a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the signed treaty reconfigures the valley’s future while Elara stands on the terrace, cost legible in her loosened grip and dawn fatigue. Causal linkage is clean—each beat flows from descent to negotiation to signature—yet the ritual mechanics of the terrace remain ornamental rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The terrace and valley fires are sensuously anchored, but only the clipboard constrains a choice (draft treaty revealed). The midsummer stars serve as lyrical backdrop rather than tactical clock. Micro-setting succeeds; macro-setting is atmospheric, not instrumental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“end the cycle of violence”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara’s voice breaks, forcing leaders to confront forgiveness as currency. One clear deepening suffices; cost is felt in her exhaustion, though not yet paid in irrevocable loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption emerges through the treaty’s fragile ink rather than exposition. The final image of dawn on the flawed, signed page offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. One near-theme-statement (“price of redemption is…”) is brief and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation matching emotional crests. POV remains tightly focalized through Elara; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial bodies”) fits the ceremonial frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“slow dance” twice) and one mixed metaphor (“anchor ideals in practice”) nudge it below 8. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forever-war negotiator with a scarred clipboard is fresh enough, yet the ritual terrace and celestial clock feel familiar. Specificity of the stained, scratched clipboard rescues it from trope; transformation is moderate, not radical.</comment>
