<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—“darkening brightness” and the tablet’s pulse anchor contradictory impulses—but the self-encounters remain symbolic tableaux rather than crucibles that force new micro-choices; the final smile feels more bestowed than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the viaduct re-integrates and the tablet fades, reconfiguring her stance toward the labyrinth. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glowing, rain-slick viaduct and shifting fractal paths are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s suspension; the tablet’s glow serves as micro-setting that constrains her next step, though broader city geography remains sketch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—embracing rather than conquering the fractured self—escalates through each timeline shard; the final crystallization narrows her options from mastery to acceptance, but the price is more epiphanic than materially paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as an accretion of lived and unlived choices. The tablet’s fade-out reweights the premise without moralizing, though the resonance leans cerebral rather than gut-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice maintains consistent lyric distance; rhythmic control and selective metaphor (“ribbon of light”) suit the gravity-defier’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“periodically eternal”) risks register drift but stays within tolerable bounds. No loops or scaffold artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The procedural-generation maze of selves offers a fresh twist on the multiverse trope; specificity of painter-Elara and destroyer-Elara prevents generic drift, though the concept’s mechanics remain lightly sketched.</comment>
