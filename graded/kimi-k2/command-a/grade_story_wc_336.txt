<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction (preserving wonder vs. mortal limits) is embodied, the heirloom choice is a micro-choice under pressure, and her renunciation of conventional pruning frames the closure cost. Symbolic "pruner" tag is only lightly activated; more embodied action would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal turns hinge on planting the seed and the radiance that locks in restoration, both shown on page. Orientation is gentle: who/where anchored early, waterfall serves as running meter. Closure earns a charged hush but slightly generalized; one sharper beat of consequence could have tightened the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting becomes a character: waterfall rhythm paces Elara’s internal clock, parapet constrains footing during planting, spray dictates silences. Sensory hierarchy filtered through orchard POV bias. Final shot—glowing shoot against gold dusk—uses setting to recharge earlier imagery, just shy of a physical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preservation of wonder via single seed; decision to plant under budding-hope pressure deepens one choice. No active antagonist, escalation is internal (risk of full orchard loss), cost appears as irrevocable planting and possible overstretch of her craft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Themes of repair vs. wonder emerge implicitly through one seed’s journey. The refrain of “radiant hush” evolves at the end into a charged poise rather than explicit moral. Subtext in touches (grandmother’s silence, glow shoot) reinforce without summary speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Accumulative lyric sensibility is taught early (waterfall meter, orchard vocabulary) and modulates with emotional rise. Nonstandard compression (“succor slipped into loam”) is voice-driven, patterns clear by landscape return. Dialogue sparse yet cadenced; orchardspeak feels lived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Purposeful rhythm, strong verbs (“seed shot up,” “waterfall sang”). One near-loop with “wonder” three times but spaced enough to read intentional. No scaffolding; dense information flow. Waterfall diction stays within orchard lexicon; no read-aloud bumps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—a sole seed tied to orchard memory—feels fresh; succor via essence captures is specific to Elara’s micro-ritual. No rescue twist via sudden magic. Quiet ending’s charged seed-glow offers specific reweighting of stakes.</comment>
