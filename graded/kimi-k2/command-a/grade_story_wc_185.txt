<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—“to protect the fragile harmony of her world”—is clear early and recycled each time pressure rises; her micro-choice to risk letting the storm write itself into the seed qualifies as a beat, yet interiority never cracks open a genuine contradiction beneath the surface. Embodied emotion is generic (“her heart steady,” “her spirit light”) rather than particular, though the final renunciation is visible on the page. Competence slightly exceeds struggle: the bloom appears when summoned, rather than forcing unforeseen sacrifice, muting the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure lands an Earned Stasis—the shift from “a storm of light and sound” to “gentle lullaby” re-configures the sonic world with visible, felt calm. Causality holds through the because/therefore path cracked-ice→path→bloom→silence. One trivial artifact: “the energy beings’ arrival” is only stated, not delivered through on-page cues, but this does not break pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The echo chamber stone, spiral ice cracks, and seed pedestal are concrete, tactile tools that anchor orientation and later constrain Lira’s conjuring choices. Sensory hierarchy—first sound, then haptic ice, then faint interior pulse—mirrors the stakes into the body. The bloom’s final glow is charged as micro-setting, reconfiguring the perceptual space, satisfying the 9- gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm”—is articulated in the inciting paragraph. A single tightening occurs when Lira turns from cracked ice deciphering to seed song-making, which forecloses the possibility of further exploration; the visible cost is Lira’s exhaustion (“her body weary”). Pressure remains textural: accumulating silence saturates scenes until it displaces cacophony. The scale feels balanced for 700 drift words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The theme of balance-through-silence emerges from the sonic patterning—cacophony→hush—not didactic statement. The bloom’s final shimmer reweights all earlier cracks as latent paths to stillness. A marginal slip: “she had brought balance back to her world” leans summary; yet the gesture of “the bloom of hush would endure” charges the image conceptually. No redundant moralizing costs the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close is stable, locked through Lira’s perceptual filter—“walls seemed to close in,” “air growing heavier.” Lexis favors triple-rhythm sensory verbs (shimmered, hummed, pulsed) that modulate with proximity to the bloom. Only one register drift: “Conceptual Repricing” phrasing in final paragraph feels imported rather than inhabited, but the effect remains clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose accomplishes high density with minimal loops; “luminous glow”/”gently luminous glow” is the single cyclical modifier, forgiven inside intentionally recurring motif. Rhythm flexes from steady narration to short sequential breath-fragments: “slowly, a path materialized, a trail of gently luminous light leading deeper…” No overwriting at peak. Clean grammar, spatial tracking throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combination of ice-crack cartography + conjuring silence-seed is a fresh synthesis that would collapse if stripped of either part. The “bloom of hush” conceptually re-trains generic meditative-light; slip danger was overwritten by embodied procedural discovery in cracks + artifact. Not yet risk-taking at structural level, but specificity secures 8-9 upper band.</comment>
