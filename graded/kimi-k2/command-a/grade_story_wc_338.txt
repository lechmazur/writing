<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and empathy are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing grooves, frame-by-frame video comparison, deliberate excavation). The final descent into the chapel is earned by these prior actions and carries a palpable cost—she now shoulders guardianship of silence. Interiority is specific, but the “shielded openness” trait is asserted more than dramatized. No contradictory impulses are staged in scene; motivation is steady rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the discovery of the chapel reweights the henge from relic to testament, and Elara’s stance crystallizes into guardian-of-silence with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned layering of video frames, rain-scoured stone, and silence builds to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One minor causality wobble: the footage discrepancy alone does not clearly force the dig; empathy supplies the missing push.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and henge are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s map-framer eye; fresco layers mirror her stratigraphic thinking. The chapel beneath becomes a micro-setting that constrains her final stance. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—sound drops out, light discrepancy sharpens. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves during excavation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging known/unknown via silence—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each layer peeled back (video, stone, soil) tightens the cost of knowing. The final discovery forecloses the option of leaving the site untouched; Elara’s guardianship is the price. Agency is present but slightly undercut by the convenient wooden beams “preserved by silence.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as keeper of buried truths emerges organically from excavation beats and the chapel’s intact altar. Subtext operates in the discrepancy of light and the unspoken weight of guardianship. Final image—vault frescoes glowing with revived color—reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and alignment. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments during discovery. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within Elara’s lexicon. Compression (“shielded openness”) is taught early and paid off in the final stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“rings of a tree”). One scaffold loop—“she reopened the footage, frame by frame”—is redundant. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph leans slightly purple but lands the resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of map-framer’s precision with archaeological mystery feels fresh; the silent-video comparison device is specific and non-obvious. Chapel-under-henge is an ancient trope, but the emphasis on silence as preservative and burden transforms it. Risk is moderate; payoff coherent. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
