<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s honesty-as-flaw is embodied in micro-choices (handing back the pot, steady gaze) and the final refusal to keep lying; the father’s softening is credible. Interiority avoids therapy-speak. Yet the father’s shift is compressed into a single glance, so the relational crucible feels sketched rather than forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: each beat links because/therefore (ink pot → breach → refusal → tentative hand). Closure is Earned Stasis: Clara forecloses flight with visible cost in the father’s grip. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. Minor ellipsis around the asylum deal is acceptable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prep-room details (formaldehyde, wax, flickering fluorescents) are filtered through Clara’s wary attention and guide her discovery of the ink pot. The marble table and sealed pot physically constrain her reach and later the father’s anger. Atmosphere supports the deathly-yet-vital tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stay vs flee honestly—tightens once when Clara breaches the lie. Escalation is causal: the ink pot’s pulse raises the cost of silence, forcing her stance. The price is the father’s visible disappointment and their uncertain future. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme of honesty as non-negotiable currency emerges through concrete action; the ink pot’s liquefaction literalizes the collapse of rigid deceit. Subtext in the father’s muttered “Sense is overrated” carries regret. Final image of clasped hands reframes the “fair trade” without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays inside Clara’s perceptual field; sensory bias is child-specific (cool marble, “strange energy”). Syntax tightens under pressure: “She opened her mouth… Instead, she held the pot out.” No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “air smelled faintly of formaldehyde and wax.” No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“deathly vitality”—is intentional and thematic. Filter verbs are rare; strong verbs carry motion. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Fusion of funeral-home setting with con-artist asylum plot feels fresh; the ink pot as catalyst for moral breach is non-obvious. Specificity (cracked porcelain, sealed ink) prevents cliché. Risky tonal blend of gothic and domestic pays off in the final handclasp.</comment>
