<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the console, the shard pulsing—but the “discard assumptions” mechanic is told more than dramatized; the final peace feels slightly unearned because the cost is abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the shard’s release reconfigures the city from ruin to rebirth under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The moon’s perigee and the shard’s hum tighten the pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—the city’s glow and Elara’s relinquishment of control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The suspended city, gorge, and lunar light are selective and atmospheric; the radio tower itself constrains Elara’s reach and vantage, charging the final image when the towers re-illuminate. Spatial choreography is coherent, though “crumbling” vs. “glowing” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the shard is a mirror, not a tool. The pressure deepens through her successive assumption-drops, narrowing options until the final release. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical renewal emerges organically from the shard’s mirror logic and the moon’s pull. The final image of silence as “the space where all possibilities began” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in the towers’ shift from skeletal to luminous is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm and sensory specificity (“serenely electric,” “thread of light”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final chorus. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with strong verbs and varied sentence rhythm. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial signal interpreter,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward register drift but stays within Elara’s arcane vocation. No loops or scaffold; density is high without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The shard-of-hush concept and lunar-tuned rebirth feel fresh, synthesizing familiar tropes (post-apocalyptic ruin, magical artifact) through Elara’s specific vocation and the moon’s gravitational logic. Risk is moderate but coherent; transformation test passes.</comment>
