<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet resolve is sketched through tactile habit (sea glass in pocket) and micro-choice (re-stacking stones), but interior contradiction remains muted; the final stance crystallizes without a felt cost on the page, keeping him just shy of high-band depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp relit, Elias’s new guardianship acknowledged. Causal linkage holds—stone code → compartment → letters → resolve—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized, softening the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lantern room’s darkness, the stone stack, and the warming sea glass anchor place and pressure; selective sensory detail (flicker, scrape, glow) constrains Elias’s choices and charges the final image with quiet resolve.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“protect the light”—is signaled early and tightened by the lamp’s failure and the urgent message. Escalation is coherent but leans on mystery mechanics rather than escalating external threat; cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship and inherited duty emerges through pattern (glass, stones, letters) rather than statement. The final image of the steady beam reframes prior motifs into quiet resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction is spare, rhythmic, and consistent. No dialogue appears; the reticent interiority is well-calibrated to character and setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminescent ache”) risks poetic drift but is reined in by concrete action. High information density with no line-level artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-cipher premise feels fresh in its integration of sailor stone-code and anonymous letters, yet the emotional arc treads familiar ground of quiet custodianship. Specificity of sea-glass chain rescues it from cliché.</comment>
