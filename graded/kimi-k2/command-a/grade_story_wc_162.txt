<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “featherly determination” is embodied in the deliberate way she steps onto the groaning glass—but the father remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the final renunciation feels more asserted than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara leaves the logbook behind, a Charged Poise that reweights the past and forecloses further search. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each prism flash and code fragment layers density until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is more than backdrop; its shifting panes physically constrain movement and mirror Elara’s fracturing certainty. Light and glass charge the final image when she lays the logbook down, making the setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why some thresholds are sacred—tightens once when memory reveals the father’s dictum and Elara chooses renunciation. Cost is felt in the relinquished logbook, though pressure could have sharpened earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from Elara’s relinquishment; no moralizing intrudes. The final image reweights earlier motifs without explicit statement, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a perceptual signature tuned to refraction and hush. No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision serve the Accumulative/Textural design and are paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional figurative excess (“fractured hush,” “weight of choices made and unmade”) flirts with overwriting yet never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The corn-maze-meets-prism-terrace synthesis feels fresh, and the weather-code-as-emotional-map device transforms a familiar missing-father plot. Specificity of light and glass keeps it from sliding into generic magical realism.</comment>
