<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s grief is embodied in origami cranes and unfinished lanterns; his interior contradiction—crafting to escape vs. needing to feel—drives every beat. The micro-choice to unfold the crane at the altar crystallizes the arc with visible cost (abandoning control). Secondary pressure from Lira is brief but forces stance shift. Motivation stays rooted and intensifies to the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael renounces transforming grief into product, foreclosing the lantern-as-escape path. Causal chain—Lira’s prompt → basilica visit → crane unfolding—holds. One transition (garden→basilica) is clean. Cost is felt in the softened light wrapping him. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating island, mist, and glass basilica are vivid yet selective; basilica’s shifting light constrains Kael’s perception and final choice. Tea garden remains slightly generic, but the basilica interior functions as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kael keep using craft to evade grief?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: basilica reveals the shadow was self-built armor, forcing the unfolding. Cost is the relinquished shield of denial. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief’s un-craftable nature emerges through action (folding, polishing, unfolding) without sermonizing. Final image of the unfinished lantern reweighted as tribute offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in Lira’s gentle refusal of “transform” carries quiet authority. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Kael’s tactile craft; perceptual signature favors gem-light and paper creases. Syntax modulates with emotional crests. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“You cannot transform grief into light”). No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“mist clung…lover’s whisper”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous torment”) stays within Kael’s artisanal sensibility. Final paragraph’s cadence shift supports closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dream-recording lanterns and grief-folded cranes synthesize fresh emotional tech without gimmickry. Paradox of descending-while-ascending island mirrors Kael’s stasis-in-motion. Specificity of dreamstone carving and origami mechanics anchors the fantastical. No close echoes of prior works.</comment>
