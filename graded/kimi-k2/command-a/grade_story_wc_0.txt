<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her shift from cosmic to microscopic focus is embodied in the glove-adjustment and kneeling—but the “needless drama” motive stays abstract; the butterfly’s resurrection feels wondrous rather than earned by her flaws or choices, blurring cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the butterfly’s appearance reconfigures meaning (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is implied rather than explicit—dust “remembers” without dramatized mechanism—yet the before/after is legible and the greenhouse becomes a charged canvas.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid, tactile, and constrains action (broken glass, soaked soil). The butterfly dust as micro-setting object charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive within 120 words; weather and ruin mirror internal decay without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering what matters after loss—tightens as patterns evolve. Pressure grows via observation and incremental growth, not reversal. Cost is conceptual (awe, humility) rather than tangible, but remains legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of gradual transformation emerges through dust patterns and decay; no explicit moralizing. The butterfly’s rebirth reweights the premise quietly, inviting reflection on fragility and persistence. Subtext resides in silence and shimmer rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is calm, precise, slightly cool—fitting a scientist’s perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with wonder (“kindled humility”) without drifting into purple. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“brackish,” “iridescence”) fits Elara’s lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of neutron-star physics with butterfly-scale magic is fresh; gradual change via dust patterns feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk is moderate—lyric speculative rather than hard SF—but executed with conviction and specificity.</comment>
