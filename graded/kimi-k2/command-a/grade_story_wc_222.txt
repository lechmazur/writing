<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his “cautious abandon” surfaces in the queen-rook swap—but the shift from hardened thief to wonder-reclaimer is asserted more than embodied; the cost of that re-opening is named, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each chess move tightens options until the final swap reveals the lid’s true function. Closure lands with a visible sky-change and implied personal cost, satisfying the Decisive Change test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spire’s shifting corridors and life-size ice board constrain tactics and mirror Kael’s inner thaw; selective sensory detail (crystalline glow, wind-whipped cloak) charges the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the sky”—is signaled early and escalates through the chess trial; the queen sacrifice visibly forecloses retreat, tightening pressure under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovering wonder emerges organically from Kael’s choices; the final image of the restored sky offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story’s central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature sharpens under pressure (“footsteps swallowed by the vast, frozen expanse”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly glow”) is kept in check by POV filter. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chivalrous thief + living chessboard + sky-amending key feels inevitable in hindsight. The pocket-sundial twist reweights the quest without gimmickry.</comment>
