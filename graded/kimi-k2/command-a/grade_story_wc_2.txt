<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—his obsession with precision versus his embrace of uncertainty—is embodied in the compass and the final renunciation of “fixing” time. Micro-choices (wading into the pool, folding the map back) show value hierarchy. The shift from repair to creation is earned, though the stranger’s motivation remains off-page, slightly softening cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he forecloses the path of clock-repair perfectionism by crafting a device that celebrates mystery. Causal chain (compass → greenhouse → cavern → map → renunciation) holds under a Situational lens; pressure crystallizes stance. Cost is felt in the quiet loss of his former identity. Orientation is clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Workshop, greenhouse, cavern, and waterfall are vividly sketched with sensory economy; the cracked glass and bioluminescent fungi constrain movement and mood. The compass rose itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. A few phrases (“ghost of its former self”) edge generic, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery over time versus surrender to uncertainty—tightens once when he chooses to fold the map and renounce treasure. Escalation is one deepening beat under Situational lens; coincidence (swirling leaves) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is quiet but legible: he abandons lifelong craft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges from concrete choices (improvising with the compass, leaving the map) rather than statement. Final image of crafting a “mystery” device reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the spinning-then-still needle is effective; a hairline slip into “he realized” keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in mechanical metaphors (“gears of thought”). Rhythm modulates from languid workshop description to tighter cavern beats. No dialogue; prose carries subtext through action. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable pull”) slightly above tinkerer idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are mostly precise (“needle darting like a trapped moth”). One mixed image (“earth whispering approval”) and a few filter verbs (“he felt”) keep it from 8.0. Density is high; every sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—time-tinkerer guided by a haunted compass to underground revelation—feels fresh, synthesizing steampunk and mythic quest without cliché. The inversion of treasure-as-understanding rather than gold is non-obvious. Specificity of brass compass rose and bioluminescent cavern anchors originality. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
