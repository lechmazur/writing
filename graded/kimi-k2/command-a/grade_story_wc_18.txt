<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “capture a runaway dream” is stated early and re-asserted at the end, but the interior contradiction between grounded craft and impossible yearning is only asserted, not dramatized in micro-choice. Her single decisive action—raising the restored sextant—feels inevitable yet the cost (loss of fog-shielded isolation) is named rather than embodied. Secondary character remains a cipher; no status tension or relationship crucible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s fog boundary dissolves, reweighting Elara’s stance from containment to crossing. Causal chain (broken sextant → restoration → boundary erasure) is legible under a Causal lens, though the “synchronized breathing” mechanic appears late and functions more as ritual flourish than constraint. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thick fog and ruined orchard are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elara’s internal state. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice (must be restored before boundary can be tested). Frost twilight tightens temporal pressure. Details are filtered through Elara’s craft-centric attention—glass, brass, damp wood—without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve boundaries to reach the dream world—is signaled early and tested once at climax. Escalation is a single tightening: fog thins as sextant aligns. Cost is conceptual (loss of safe ruin) rather than visceral; no tangible forfeiture shown. Agency rests entirely with Elara; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges from concrete action (restoring sextant, breathing with cosmos) rather than statement. Final image of orchard made lush reframes earlier decay without moralizing. Subtext in wanderer’s “eyes like polished obsidian” hints at unknown stakes but remains underused. Complexity acknowledged but not deeply explored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature favors tactile glasswork detail and rhythmic inhalation/exhalation mirroring cosmic pulse. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but voice-differentiated (wanderer whispers, Elara replies with craft precision). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences during restoration, clipped phrases at threshold moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and propulsive; sensory nouns and strong verbs (“gnarled,” “gleaming,” “swirling”) avoid purple overload. One minor loop: “thick fog” repeated in close proximity. No mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s “glass mountains of her imagination” risks overwriting but lands as earned metaphor bridging craft and dream.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar quest-for-dream premise is refreshed through mirror-maker craft and astronomical sextant; combination feels organic. Risk lies in lyric mode rather than plot twist. Specificity of breathing-to-cosmos method and fog-orchard fusion keeps it from template territory. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
