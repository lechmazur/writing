<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and ritual impulse are embodied in the velvet pouch and trembling palm, but interior contradiction is muted; the “mirage of safety” never collides with a counter-desire strong enough to complicate the scattering. The final beat of acceptance is credible yet feels foregone, lacking a visible cost that would deepen the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ash settles, the chair stills, and impermanence is crystallized with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Gallery’s dim sconces, marble echo, and the rocking chair’s creak create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Elara’s ritual timing. The porcelain mask’s jagged edges return in the final image, charging the closure with fragility. Selective sensory detail supports mood without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring the dead through impermanence—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the rocking chair stops, forcing the final scattering; cost is the irrevocable loss of the portrait’s last physical trace. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of fragility as beauty emerges through the mask and ash; no explicit moralizing. Final image of ash settling on the mask reweights the “mirage of safety” without stating it. Subtext resides in silence and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the ritual’s solemnity. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s selective attention to light, texture, and creaking wood. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“ash dancing” is earned). No loops or scaffold. Minor register elevation (“somber marvel”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The ash-scattering ritual and porcelain mask feel fresh in their confluence; the “mirage of safety” angle is non-obvious. Specificity of the gallery’s stillness and the rocking chair’s final creak create memorable texture. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
