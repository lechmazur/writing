<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is embodied—voice cracking, handle warming—but the “mournfully eager” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to a flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tentative laughter returns, reweighting the premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sound and echo increases until the tunnel “exhales.” Cost is felt in Eli’s exhaustion, though the causality between lullaby and laughter remains lightly magical rather than rigorously earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is more than backdrop; its acoustic properties amplify stakes and literally shape the final image. Micro-setting—the warm pull-cord handle—functions as charged object, constraining grip and signaling completion. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying sound density. One meaningful tightening: the tunnel’s shift from hollow to warm. Cost is visible in Eli’s heaving chest, though the external stakes remain abstract (“the world itself”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of tending the unspoken emerges organically from Eli’s off-key lullabies and the leaf-blower’s mechanical prayer. Final image of tentative laughter offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in shadows “dancing like old memories” is effective, though occasional phrases edge toward overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—jagged lullaby, mechanical whine, whispering walls—remains controlled under pressure. POV is stable single-camera; perceptual signature is mournfully musical. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal cadence, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“macerate the stillness,” “stitch together what had been lost”) risk overwriting. Rhythm modulates well; no loops or scaffold. Filter verbs minimal; sensory verbs strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leaf-blower-as-conductor is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable once established. The transformation of industrial noise into restorative symphony is specific to this voice and setting. Risk-taking in magical acoustics pays off without breaking coherence.</comment>
