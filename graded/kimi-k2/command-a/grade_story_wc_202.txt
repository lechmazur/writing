<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing the elusively tangible edge”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to leave the tower feels more inevitable than costly. Backstory is woven with present cues, yet the emotional stakes flatten in the last beat. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens fragment’s glow fades, marking the cost of completed duty. Causal chain is clear—fragment → symbol → map → tower → narrative reclaimed—though the middle jump from market to ruins is elided without felt friction. Orientation is anchored early; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is rendered in selective, sensory strokes (“copper and burnt sage,” “ropes and pulleys”) that guide Lila’s movement; the tower’s ivy-covered doorway constrains her final entry. Micro-setting (lens fragment as tactile anchor) charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightened when the map reveals the ruined tower. One meaningful deepening: the murals’ secrets reweight the city’s buried past. Cost is conceptual (stories reclaimed, fragment dimmed) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as resistance emerges through concrete action (decoding murals, lens-guided search) rather than statement. Final image of the fragment’s fading glow offers non-literal resonance: memory now lives in her, not the glass. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm and sensory specificity (“symphony of whispers trading secrets”). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“elusively tangible”) is taught early and consistent. Compression and elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences often do double duty. Minor loop risk in repeated “elusively tangible,” but pattern feels intentional. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (magical market, memory keeper) through Lila’s translator lens and fragment-as-key, yielding fresh texture. Risky vertical market setting is fully inhabited. Transformation test: story would collapse without lighthouse shard and mural decoding.</comment>
