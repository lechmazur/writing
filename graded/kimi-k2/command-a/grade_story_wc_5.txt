<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s patience is embodied in micro-gestures and her interiority is consistent, yet the heartbeat-to-map motive remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the map pulses with new life and Elara steps away. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and starlight infusion reweight the orchard’s stillness. Cost is felt in the spent vial and her measured renunciation of rest, but the lens could be crisper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s frost, shattered glass, and ghostly starlight glow are vivid and selective; the crater’s cold constrains her dexterity and the final illumination charges the closing image. Spatial anchors are present early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into maps—is declared early. Pressure tightens via the sealing ritual, but the orchard itself offers no active opposition; escalation is more atmospheric than causal, and the cost (spent starlight) is present yet low-impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation-through-patience emerges organically from action; the starlight map becomes a non-literal answer to the cost of safekeeping memory. Avoids overt moralizing, though the heartbeat metaphor drifts toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature favors tactile precision (“calloused yet graceful”). No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“safekept starlight”) fits the alchemist’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free; minor scaffold (“her hands remained steady, a physical demonstration of her patience”) could be tighter. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. High information density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy, cartography, and starlight feels fresh; discarded-item patterning and heartbeat cartography are specific and non-generic. The quiet, accumulative closure is risky yet legible. Minor deduction for abstract heartbeat premise.</comment>
