<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her tactile handling of the lens and the bread, but interiority drifts into summary (“she realized then”) rather than simultaneous contradiction; the final stance crystallizes with cost yet feels slightly pre-announced.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens and bread reconfigure communal memory with visible cost (laughter after years of silence). Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (workshop → square) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Grotto’s damp air and bioluminescent fungi are filtered through Elara’s curatorial eye; the waterfall’s mist physically clings during the climax, charging the final image. Micro-setting (lens glow on altar) constrains the communal choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving a dying tradition—is signaled early and tightened when the honeyed bread becomes the test; the communal laughter is the earned cost/confirmation. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges through the bread initials and lens glow; no explicit moralizing. Final image of cascading green light offers non-literal reweighting of displacement and continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, curatorial yet sensorily precise (“rosewater dread”). No dialogue, so free indirect style carries subtext; slight drift into elevated diction (“symbol of their shared history”) keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft fillers (“something shifted”) and one mixed metaphor (“thaw the frozen memories”) nudge it down. No loops or scaffold in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar refugee-memory trope is refreshed by the honey-bread ritual and opera-glass catalyst; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
