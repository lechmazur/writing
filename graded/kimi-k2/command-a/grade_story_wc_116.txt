<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is evocative but abstract; her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. enter the refuge) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final “she had become the silence” is a tidy epiphany that feels earned by the journey yet lacks embodied cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s peace is reweighted from burden to vocation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of decay/rebirth rather than causal chain. One transition (library → refuge → library) is clean and within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Library, refuge, and swan are vividly rendered and return in the final image to reweight meaning. Micro-setting (swan as map) constrains the choice to burrow. Spatial anchors hold; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—witnessing without judgment versus surrendering to transformative silence—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the swan reveals the map, forcing the choice to enter the refuge. Cost is conceptual (loss of prior self) but not viscerally staged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence emerges through cyclical imagery rather than statement. Subtext operates in the swan’s cryptic folds and the mirror’s dissolution. Final image offers non-literal resonance: silence as both preservation and erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Lira’s archivist sensibility. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Patterned elision (e.g., “drift of untold seasons”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished and rhythmic, with high information density. Occasional elevated diction (“regenerative silence,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds POV lexicon but remains coherent. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses familiar tropes (hidden library, transformative mirror) through Lira’s specific vocation and the origami-swan map. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no gimmicks, but also no radical departure.</comment>
