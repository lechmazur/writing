<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s duality—intellectual rigor against emotional fragility—is embodied in micro-choices (quaking hands with the egg). His renunciation of the machine’s guarantee offers earned stasis; the cost is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The causal linkage (“because the map → therefore descent → revealed machine”) holds; the closure (renouncing forced beauty) lands as charged poise. Mythic scope slightly strains 800-word economy in setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crystal spires and fungal glow are precision-shot specific; the suspended palace functions as both glittering lure and isolating cage. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mechanical decay versus natural rebirth tightens with each beat; the choice to risk a renaissance embodies a visible conceptual cost. Stakes tilt larger than the page can fully field.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The flawed-genesis premise drives tactics (“to unlock beauty, accept imperfection”) and reframes moral ambiguity. The ending refracts through the egg’s refusal to hatch, offering non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyrical yet concrete (“shimmering with otherworldly glow”); free-indirect stance stays with Kael. Avoids sentimentality by grounding thought in physical stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm alternates long breathers with compressed clauses mirroring heartbeat. Two template patterns (“scent of...”, “symbol of...”) slightly dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Familiar mythic-mechanical mash-up is revitalized by the prince’s hypothesis-first approach. No other single image fuses idea and symbol without substitution.</comment>
