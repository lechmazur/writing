<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila’s steadfastness is asserted rather than embodied; her interiority is generic (“everything” stakes) and the final “rewriting rules” claim lacks prior contradiction or cost. The watch-fob shift from heirloom to weapon is declared, not dramatized through micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise, but the causal chain is thin: the fortune-teller’s hint and necklace sighting resolve the conflict off-stage, and the “sound of trust breaking” remains unheard. Orientation is clear, yet the decisive change feels asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The rotting-pier market is sketched with salt/decay scent and hushed tones, grounding atmosphere. However, the setting constrains no tactical choice; Lila navigates it without spatial friction or resource use, so it charges atmosphere more than action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“truce of hush” and father’s stolen shipment—are declared early, but pressure escalates only through dialogue threats rather than narrowing options or visible cost. The final standoff defuses via words, leaving the truce intact and the cost abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust as fragile currency emerges through the fob and hush, avoiding overt moralizing. The quiet ending reweights the heirloom as “weapon,” but the resonance is dampened because the trust-break remains off-page and conceptual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is consistent, with sensory filtering (“salt and decay”) and restrained diction. Dialogue carries subtext (“Looking for something?”), though pirate argot is mild. Rhythm stays unobtrusive, supporting tension without drawing attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional generic phrasing (“weight that isn’t yours to bear”) slightly dulls specificity, but no figurative muddle or register drift mars the final beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The moonshine-under-pier world feels lived-in, yet plot beats—fortune-teller clue, necklace reveal—are familiar noir scaffolding. The “sound of trust breaking” concept is fresh but remains conceptual; risk-taking is moderate.</comment>
