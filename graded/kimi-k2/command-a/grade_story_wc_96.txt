<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “molting” is announced, not dramatized; we never see a prior self or feel cost when he claims permanence. Clara’s quiet strength stays abstract—no contradictory impulse under pressure. The bond is stated (“friendship sparked”) rather than tested; no status shift or shared risk alters it. Endurance is asserted (“this self was here to stay”) without a beat that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing library reweights earlier fractures, cost legible in the final image. Causality is loose, however—how does poem-painting convert a prison yard into sanctuary? The coffee tin’s letters motivate Elias, but the link between “words rebuild” and the rooftop declaration is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens contradiction at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rusted shelves, dust motes, rooftop skyline—selective, atmospheric, filtered through Elias’s patched coat. The library’s physical state (sagging spines, creaking gate) tracks with the rebuilding action, constraining what can be salvaged. Moonlight and star-framed silhouette charge the final image effectively. No spatial drift; micro-setting (coffee tin) handled tactilely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—signaled early. Middle deepening: letters prove words can survive war, tightening Elias’s resolve. Yet external pressure (prison authorities, vagrant danger, resource limits) stays off-page; escalation is interior and declarative. Final stance crystallizes, but options were never narrowed by an antagonistic force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of luminous fracture emerges through concrete images: poems painted on walls, light through cracks. Subtext resides in the tin’s hidden letters—past resilience quietly underwriting present hope. No moralizing summary; final line lets the library “whisper” the answer. Could use one earlier counter-image of failed art to sharpen the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Elias’s dreamer register without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, contracts on the roof, mirroring pulse. Perceptual signature strong: “coat patched with stories,” “map of scars.” Occasional elevated phrasing (“blooming resistance”) feels authorial rather than character-bound, a minor distancing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm variety; sentences advance image or motive without scaffold. One paraphrase loop: “not just physically, but as a sanctuary” restates prior clause. Metaphors consistent (light/fracture) and coherent. No filter-verb stacks; prose breathes under 800 words. Clean copy, only minor adjectival padding (“quiet strength,” “sharp mind”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Combines vagrant poet + prison library + secret tin—fresh synthesis, not trope retread. Monthly personality molting promises volatility yet delivers little on-page change, muting ingenuity. Letters-as-reconstruction motif feels inevitable in hindsight, grounding risk. Could push further: show one poem that actually alters a prisoner’s choice to prove art’s anarchic power.</comment>
