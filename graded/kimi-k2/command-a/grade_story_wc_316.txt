<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—trembling hands, the cool jar, the spark of dormant emotion—but the “ego death survivor” label is asserted rather than dramatized. The contradictory impulse (embrace vs. destroy the duplicate brain) is staged clearly, yet the cost of integration feels abstract; the shattering of glass is more symbolic than viscerally paid. Micro-choices under pressure (gripping swords, reaching for the jar) are specific and character-bound, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s demand for embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s decisive strike dissolves the jar and the numbness, reconfiguring identity with visible cost (the lost separateness of the duplicate). Causal linkage holds—each sword strike is a question answered by the brain’s mirrored response—though the “history rewrites itself” frame remains ornamental. Orientation is clean by 120 words; the floating dojo and void are anchored through Kael’s bodily focus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is sketched with selective sensory cues—clouds, void hum, cool glass—that constrain Kael’s movement and charge the final image. The yin-yang swords function as micro-setting objects that guide choice. No spatial drift; bodies and distances track cleanly across the duel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeat emotional numbness) is signaled early and tightened through the duel’s mirrored pressure. Each parry narrows options until the final strike forecloses separateness; the cost is the surrender of a discrete past self. Agency is clear; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of integration vs. annihilation emerges from the concrete custody duel; the brain’s glow reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in mirrored swordplay and the silent pulse of the jar. Final image of merged essence offers a non-literal answer to the numbness question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perception; no head-hopping. Prose texture is lean, rhythmic, and slightly elevated to match the dojo’s ritual gravity. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Lira’s lines slice with declarative force.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and stress to match duel tempo; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“shroud of numbness,” “dance of complementary opposites”). Clean grammar and pronoun reference throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody premise is familiar, but grounding it in a floating dojo duel with mirrored swordplay gives fresh inflection. Specificity of the amber brain and yin-yang blades prevents generic drift. Risk is moderate; payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
