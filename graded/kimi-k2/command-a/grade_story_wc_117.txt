<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is gentle and consistent, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the curl’s glow and Finn’s wonder are the only visible cost. Motivation (nurture wonder) is stated rather than dramatized through a hard choice. The link with Finn shifts his stance, yet Elara’s own arc feels more observational than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the curl’s re-purposing from private relic to shared talisman reweights meaning with quiet cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of soft intensification rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One meaningful cadence shift at totality suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“grass seemed to glow faintly”—that mirror the eclipse hush. The clearing functions as micro-setting constraining their shared stance. Details are POV-filtered and purposeful; no white-room syndrome. Could edge higher if terrain actively blocked or enabled a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling wonder in Finn—is signaled early and tightened once when the curl glows. Cost is soft (emotional shift, no tangible loss), but visible in Finn’s dropped telescope. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through image and gesture, not lecture. Final reweighting of the curl avoids moralizing. Subtext in Elara’s lullaby-hum and Finn’s silence carries more than dialogue. Complexity is present but stays gentle; ambiguity is coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation matching eclipse hush. POV stays tight to Elara; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—“steps were deliberate, as if each one were a note”—anchors the texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Finn’s tremor and Elara’s hush feel age-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops. Figurative language is selective—“sky is broken” from Finn’s mouth, not authorial flourish. One minor scaffold: “softly adaptive to the rare alignment” repeats the prompt phrase. Otherwise momentum holds to the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eclipse-as-catalyst for quiet transformation is familiar, yet the keepsake curl’s re-purposing offers fresh inflection. Risk is modest but coherent; no gimmicks. Specificity of music-therapist gait and child awe lifts it above template. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without Elara’s vocation and relic.</comment>
