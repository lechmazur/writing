<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—warm heart / cold resolve—is stated, not embodied; her single micro-choice (re-arranging tesserae) is too gentle to register cost. Retrocognition is label-only, never constrains tactics. Motivation (“cradle empathy in arms of steel”) remains abstract, never sharpened into a visible trade-off. No earned stasis or decisive renunciation; the ending drifts into hope without foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure is a soft uplift (“plaza… beacon of hope”) rather than a legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no on-page cost is felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence shift is muted—patterned description repeats without deepening. Orientation is clear early, yet causality slackens: the mosaic responds to touch (“seemed to shift”) but never alters real options. Final image lacks the charge required for 7+.</comment>

<comment>Plaza, minaret, and mosaic are vividly sketched, ash and dust filtering every beat. Micro-setting (the single gleaming tessera) is handled tactilely and reappears at closure, earning its keep. Shattered sky is atmospheric but never constrains choice; environment remains backdrop rather than active pressure. Still, sensory specificity is consistent and filtered through Elara’s retrocognitive gaze.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—make mercy normative—stays thematic, never crystallizes into a concrete test or irreversible choice. Escalation is gentle description layered upon itself; no tightening or deepening narrows options. Agency is limited to symbolic rearrangement; no visible price is paid. Coincidence (wind carrying “scent of renewal”) resolves nothing, but also doesn’t complicate.</comment>

<comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through imagery rather than assertion, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is present but thin: the mosaic’s new pattern gestures toward redefinition without dramatizing the social cost. Final paragraph edges toward thematic summary (“mercy… would one day be the norm”), slightly blunting resonance. Complexity is hinted, not fully inhabited.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature favors tactile detail and muted color. Syntax modulates with emotional rise and fall, though occasional elevated diction (“tesserae,” “retrocognitively”) feels slightly academic for the POV. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue remains coherent. Patterned repetition (“renaming… piece by piece”) is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly concise; figurative language is selective. Occasional loops (“mercy, though aberrant now, would one day…”) and near-paraphrase (“gentle radical,” “warm and cold”) create mild scaffold. No mixed metaphors or register drift under pressure. Final third remains artifact-free, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle lies in treating mercy as aberrant social deviance rather than personal virtue. Mosaic-as-renaming is a non-obvious conceit, though execution stays symbolic. Risk is moderate: lyric mode over causal plot. Some phrasing edges toward familiar post-apocalyptic elegy, but specificity of tessera-work keeps it from cliché.</comment>
