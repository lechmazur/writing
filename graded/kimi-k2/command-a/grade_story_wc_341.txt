<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing the brass telescope”), but the leap into the cloud feels slightly under-motivated—no prior contradiction or flaw is dramatized that makes the risk inevitable. The final smile registers as earned gratitude rather than visible cost, softening the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gondola is repaired and Elara’s theory is affirmed, but the cost is only implied (“quiet explosion of gratitude”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of sky-memory deepens—yet the causal trigger for the gondola’s sudden restoration is elided, blurring the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sky, telescope, and gondola floor are rendered with tactile specificity; the glowing cumulus becomes a micro-setting that literally pulls her. However, spatial choreography during the leap is briefly indistinct—no sense of altitude or consequence—preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove empty spaces remember”—is signaled early and tightened when the glowing cloud offers proof. The leap is the single meaningful turn, but the lack of a visible price (injury, loss, irreversible change) keeps escalation from fully charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as atmospheric residue. The final image of the sky as “memorial” reweights prior cloud-emotion taxonomy without moralizing. Yet the absence of a darker counter-reading keeps the resonance from deepening further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, meteorologist-specific (“cumulonimbus as rage”), and rhythm modulates with pressure. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“spooled wholeness”) risks register drift but remains legible under lyric license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong sensory verbs and minimal scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“dusty starlight”—is repeated without reweighting, a minor artifact. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud rhythmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cloud-memory premise is fresh, and the emotional taxonomy avoids cliché. The glowing cumulus as living archive feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—lyric leap rather than hard-SF rigor—but coherence holds.</comment>
