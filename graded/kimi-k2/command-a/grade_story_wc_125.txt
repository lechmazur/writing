<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction – thirst for temporal knowledge vs. instinct for self-preservation – acts live in every tactile beat (rope-scrape, mirror-touch). The final renunciation (leaving the rope) is earned by accumulating dread shown in the shifting mirage versions of himself; cost is embodied not stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands in an Earned Stasis: Elias sets aside the rope, accepting perpetual re-writing of the poem as price. Causal linkage holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens – each pattern recurrence raises density until the decision is the only path left.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta grotto’s fractal etchings and starlight leaks constrain every tactile move Elias makes; the rope’s coils echo the wall-grooves, fusing micro-setting to final image. The prison-scar rope itself acts as embodied setting.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake – “discover the texture of time” – escalates by incremental revelation: each pattern read, each mirror image narrows futures until only remaining choice is to keep writing the poem as time’s texture. Cost feels visceral in the rope-drop.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time-as-poem emerges organically through concrete gestures and escalating mirror variants; the ending reweights the motif without declaring any moral. Thematic resonance arises from specific cost, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tight lyric cadence mirrors Elias’s obsessive intellect; syntax flexes under pressure (“each layer revealed a choice more impossible than the last”). No head-hopping; diction fits a solitary, worn-out poet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propelling beats without clutter. One over-elaborate phrase (“ethically playful, this idea…”) is mild; no loops or scaffold dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A drifting poet confronting temporality made physical through fractal architecture and psychic mirrors is not stock SF but a fresh synthesis. The prison-rope reincarnated as cosmic thread feels inevitable in hindsight.</question>
