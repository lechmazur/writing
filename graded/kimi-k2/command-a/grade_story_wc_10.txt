<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling fingers, the tuning fork against her lips—but the contradiction between despair and hope is stated more than dramatized in scene. Kael’s arrival supplies relational pressure, yet their silent exchange is sketched rather than crucible-tested. The final renunciation (silence as canvas) is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence reweighted from void to canvas. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern discovery and color-melody deepen until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquishing of sound itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is vividly anchored early and functions as micro-setting: the cold bench, frost-veined plants, and shimmering panes all constrain Elara’s tactile choices. The heat-map device and tuning fork act as extensions of setting that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs via pattern discovery that narrows options from “restore sound” to “inhabit silence.” The tightening is driven by Elara’s agency and carries the cost of abandoning her former identity as musician.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence not as absence but as alternate language. Subtext operates in gesture and color, culminating in the non-literal final image. No moralizing; complexity lingers. The tuning fork’s ghost vibration threads motif without checklist tokenism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression: “ghost of sound that only she could feel.” POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and the winterglass idiom feels native to the narrator. Dialogue-free design is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense: “blues for melancholy, greens for hope, reds for determination” compresses palette and stakes in one line. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective; mixed metaphors absent. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the crystallizing insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—post-acoustic world translated through emotion-color—feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk lies in the silent linguistic turn, executed without gimmickry. Specificity of winterglass and heat-map device grounds the concept. Transformation test passed: swap elements and the arc collapses.</comment>
