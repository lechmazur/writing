<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“strange warmth spread through her palm”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final stance crystallizes yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stone at the festival center reconfigures community stance with visible social cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (evening→next morning) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The raft city is tactile (“patchwork of barges and houseboats cobbled together”), and the graffiti micro-settings constrain Lira’s path; final image of stone amid murals reweights the place as contested ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs. privatization—tightens through graffiti trail and festival rally; Vorin’s opposition supplies coherent pressure. One decisive intensification suffices, though cost is more collective than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically from graffiti messages and festival art; final image of stone amid murals offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in Vorin’s sneer and Lira’s silence carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature filters carnival chaos through Lira’s orderly lens. No dialogue, so free-indirect rhythm and sensory selection carry POV; occasional elevated diction (“hues of amber and gold”) fits tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm; minor scaffold (“whispered in the promises of developers”) and one mixed metaphor (“jigsaw puzzle of dreams and desperation”) nudge down. Information density high; no loops in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating gentrifying raft city feels fresh; graffiti-as-archive transforms familiar trope. Specificity of stone chip and festival art grounds concept. Risk in hopeful-desperation tone pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
