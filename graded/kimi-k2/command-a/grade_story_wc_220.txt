<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity is credibly rekindled, but his interiority stays general (“curiosity stirred like embers”) and the final smile feels unearned—no embodied cost for choosing connection. Lira is only a courier; she exerts no pressure. The bloodhound past is evocative yet never alters present tactics. Micro-choices are sparse; the leaf does the work instead of Elias’s flawed agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the leaf redefines “distance” into “closeness” with a felt social cost—Elias renounces solitude. Causality is light but coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density around the leaf tightens until meaning flips. One transition (cabin → factory) is clean. Orientation is secure by 120 words. No causality break, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The scrapyard’s metallic tang and “skeletal” factory are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s nose and memory. The leaf’s glow becomes micro-setting that constrains his final choice. Weather is absent but not missed. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. One slip: “wild hush” is stated rather than evoked, muting the tonal charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elias re-engage or stay isolated—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the phonograph’s glow forces a perceptual shift. Cost is conceptual (solitude foregone) yet thinly embodied. Agency rests with Elias, but the leaf and machine do most of the work. No escalation beyond the single deepening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Theme of connection-through-ruin emerges organically from the leaf’s transformation and Elias’s renunciation. Subtext is carried by sensory detail and the final image of shared shadows. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. The riddle’s answer is shown, not told. One near-miss: “we’re not as far apart as we think” flirts with statement but is saved by the charged visual context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction is lean, metallic, slightly weary—apt for a retired tracker. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural. Filter verbs are minimal. The final sentence’s cadence crystallizes the reconfiguration. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“embers catching flame”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional soft fillers (“as if it had been waiting for him”) but none near closure. Strong nouns and verbs; minimal modifiers. One typo risk: “wild hush” could be read as cliché, but context rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>The bloodhound-turned-hermit reading a phonograph via a waxed leaf is a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic scavenger tropes. Tropes are grounded in sensory specificity. No close echoes of famous scenes. The conceptual twist—distance into closeness—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
