<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s longing is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“shadowed rapture”) rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choice under pressure yet. Motivation is clear but static—no escalation or cost on the page. Astrolabe handling is sensory, yet it doesn’t force a decision or reveal a blind spot. Closure is pending, so full arc untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical layering of aurora, astrolabe, stardust. Yet no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration lands; the piece ends in poised anticipation rather than closure with cost. Orientation is clear by 120 words, but causality stalls—no “because/therefore” tightening. Feels like an exquisite opening chapter, not a complete 600-800 word unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elaris and the archway are atmospherically rich; aurora light, brass cold, stone breath all filter through Lira’s perception. Details guide mood more than choice—no spatial constraint alters tactics. Micro-setting (astrolabe as tactile object) almost qualifies but doesn’t yet pivot the stake. Vivid, selective, purposeful; just shy of charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore village creativity via stardust—is declared early. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal: aurora sings louder, astrolabe trembles, yet no tightening choice or trade-off appears. Escalation is textural (density of wonder) rather than option-narrowing. Cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed creativity emerges through image and ritual rather than statement. Subtext whispers in “remembered stardust” and the aurora’s song, avoiding moralizing. Final paragraph gestures toward resonance but withholds reconfiguration; ambiguity is purposeful yet not fully charged. Strong thematic coherence, but payoff awaits closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-bound: “eyes, wide and unblinking,” “hummed with distant melodies.” Syntax modulates with awe; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (“fragments of the night”) and sustained. Minor drift into elevated diction (“shadowed rapture”) but within tolerable lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense yet clear; sentences advance image or interiority without loops. Occasional stacked modifiers (“emerald and violet”) risk overwriting but stay purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Strong rhythm; final cadence lingers. One mixed metaphor (“symphony of light and sound that pulsed through her veins”) slightly muddles sensory logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lonely stargazer, ancestral astrolabe, aurora portal—are refreshed through tactile specificity and cosmic linguistics. Premise is not radically new, but execution feels personal and inevitable. Risk lies in lyrical stillness rather than plot twist; coherence holds. Fresh inflection: stardust as literal creative force.</comment>
