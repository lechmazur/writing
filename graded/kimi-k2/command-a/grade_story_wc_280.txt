<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic perception, embodied nostalgia—but her contradictory impulses remain largely ornamental; the “other Mara” is more emblem than crucible, so the cost of guiding her feels abstract rather than personally foreclosing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s timeline visibly knits, the coin’s glow transfers, and Mara’s encore continues with bittersweet cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each echo layers density until the final image reweights possibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s night-bloom scent, cracked fountain, and shifting moonlight are selective and POV-filtered; the garden itself becomes a stage that constrains movement and charges the final tableau, though spatial choreography could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“lure possibility from despair”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara offers the coin; the transfer of hope carries visible emotional cost, but escalation is more atmospheric than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of recursive self-redemption emerges through image and action; the final “performance will go on” reweights earlier echoes without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and color-shift avoids overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, theatrical diction remains consistent; synesthetic metaphors are character-bound and rhythmic. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on perceptual signature and cadence control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“colors bled… swirling like paint in water”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. Strong sentence variety and sensory economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Ghost-as-stage-manager and synesthetic time-mending feel fresh; familiar tropes of spectral regret are re-angled through sensory synesthesia and recursive self-encounter. Risky lyric compression pays off in final image.</comment>
