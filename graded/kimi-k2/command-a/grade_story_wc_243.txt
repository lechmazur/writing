<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, locket warmth—but her “gently thorough” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a choice that costs her something. The moment with Mara is touching yet passive; Elara listens rather than acts, so the decisive shift to “participate in regeneration” feels lightly earned. Still, her contradictory awe and burden create credible tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: Elara begins to document, the covenant now hers to carry. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of memory layers tightens until the final image of fading light and blooming jetty reweights the stake. Cost is felt in the phrase “her work was not just about the past—it was about the promise,” but the causality from listening to Mara to this vow could be crisper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The jetty’s weathered planks and jasmine-salt air are filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze; the locket itself becomes micro-setting, warm against her palm and later reweighted by Mara’s recognition. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, roots, twilight light. The environment doesn’t yet constrain a tactical choice, so it stops just short of 9-band constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve small moments—clarifies early and tightens when Mara reveals the covenant. Yet escalation is gentle; no irreversible option is foreclosed on the page. The cost is conceptual (future burden of stewardship) rather than visceral, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of regeneration through remembrance emerges organically from locket → covenant → Elara’s vow. Subtext hums in the locket’s warmth and the jetty’s endurance. Final image of “promise of what could still be” avoids moralizing and offers resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“walnut-ink archivist,” “haunted euphoria”—with rhythmic control that breathes with twilight. POV remains tight; no filter-verb clutter. Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices fading ink, salt-tanged jasmine, the locket’s pulse. Dialogue with Mara is brief but carries trembling subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor loops (“blooming” twice in first paragraph, “gentle breeze” echo) keep it from 8.5+. Metaphors are fresh and integrated; no purple drift. Sentence variety supports mood shifts from hush to revelation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The notion of a “regenerated covenant” carried by a locket found in tree roots feels fresh, and the archivist’s role as living conduit rather than passive recorder offers a non-obvious angle. Risk is moderate; the lyric structure is familiar, but specificity of scent, texture, and lineage grounds it.</comment>
