<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s cautious hope and grit are embodied in micro-choices (tracing charts, calibrating subwoofer) and a final resolve. Interiority is specific, but the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized. Relationship with Hank supplies brief status pressure. Endurance earns stasis with visible cost—she stays alone at the station.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: signal → decode → counter-frequency → distortion → community fracture → vigilance. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the option to leave, accepting perpetual watch. Cost is legible in the final solitude and the station’s hum. One transition (Hank’s entrance) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Radio station’s tangled wires and outdated gear constrain action (subwoofer must be scavenged). Charts reappear to anchor decisions. Dim light and hum mirror tension. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent unseen manipulation via signal. Pressure tightens when sponsors threaten shutdown and protests erupt. Counter-frequency is a decisive, costly act that narrows options—she commits to endless vigilance. Escalation is causal and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of human ingenuity versus cosmic indifference emerges through concrete beats rather than statement. Final image of Elara alone at the console reweights earlier hope into stoic resolve. Subtext in “the universe was full of tricksters” is shown by her counter-moves, not told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction is precise, slightly elevated to match an academic stargazer. Dialogue with Hank is terse, goal-driven, and carries subtext of institutional pressure. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive. Occasional atmospheric flourish (“ethereal glow”) is earned. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports pacing. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: SETI thriller meets campus radio noir in under 800 words. Cosmic tricksters as unseen antagonists avoids cliché by focusing on signal mechanics. Specificity of subsonic counter-hack feels novel. Risky quiet ending lands.</comment>
