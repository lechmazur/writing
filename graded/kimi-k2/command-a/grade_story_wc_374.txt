<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism is stated but never embodied in a contradictory choice; her luminous glow is ornamental. The ring’s pull triggers movement, yet the interior contradiction between doubt and calling remains summary, not dramatized under pressure. Closure is a deferred “understanding,” not an earned stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a deferred promise (“there, you will understand”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal linkage is thin: the ring’s taste cue leads her to the clearing, but the election’s stakes and her role are told, not tested. Orientation is clear; lens is Causal but incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Lavender bluff and aurora are vividly sketched and filter through Elara’s perception. The ring functions as micro-setting, but the environment does not actively constrain her choices or charge the final image; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical crucible.</comment>

<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why some carry weather—is declared early but never tested on the page; no tightening or cost is dramatized. The election is off-stage; pressure is atmospheric, not actionable. Agency is limited to following the ring; no visible price or narrowing of options occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of balance between skepticism and cosmic attunement is coherent but delivered through exposition. Subtext is muted; the ring’s symbolism is overt. Resonance is potential rather than realized, pending the deferred election.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with selective sensory detail and restrained lyricism. Dialogue is minimal but unobtrusive. No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature is present but not yet distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-rich without purple overload. Occasional elevated phrasing (“terrestrially cosmic spectacle”) edges toward grandeur but stays controlled. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—sentient forest elections, emotion-driven weather—feels fresh, though execution leans on familiar chosen-one beats. Specificity of taste-based sensing and luminous glow adds novelty. Risk is moderate; transformation awaits the off-page climax.</comment>
