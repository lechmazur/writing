<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative—“emotions left imprints, like echoes”—but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the fossil’s pull is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels narrated rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s role shifts from map-maker to storyteller with conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the fossil’s agency floats close to coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave network is vivid—salt-damp air, bioluminescent algae—yet its constraints on Elara’s choices remain suggestive rather than tactical. The fossil-as-micro-setting constrains the final placement, earning partial 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering forgotten history—intensifies via heat-map anomalies and fossil guidance, but escalation is more discovery than pressure; the tightening is intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-continuum emerges through pattern rather than statement; the fossil’s golden glow reweights prior maps without moralizing. Subtext of sanctuary after hibernation lingers effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—“her fingers paused”—with controlled psychic distance. No dialogue to test naturalism, but prose texture supports atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid yet occasionally drifts into gentle abstraction—“a testament to the enduring power of human emotion”—which softens peak pressure. No loops or scaffold, but figurative layering could be sharper under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Concept of sensory cartography of emotion feels fresh; fossil-as-transitional-object is specific and non-generic. Risk lies in near-mythic tone, but specificity of cave heat-maps anchors it.</comment>
