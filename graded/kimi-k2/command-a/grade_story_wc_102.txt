<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, slowed breath—but the past-life priestess backstory is delivered in one dense block rather than interleaved micro-choices, muting the contradiction that should drive her. The final “ready to heal the world” turn feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: placing the pendant reconfigures memory into usable love (Resonant Reconfiguration). Causal chain is intact—dream → viaduct → pendant → alcove. Orientation is swift; the twilight viaduct is anchored by ~50 words. One transition (viaduct → alcove) is legible and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The wisteria-draped viaduct is not mere backdrop; its iron beams hide the pendant compartment, constraining Elara’s search. Micro-setting (pendant hollow in Kwan Yin’s palm) charges the final image. Sensory layering (scent of wisteria → damp stone) tracks attention under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightened when the pendant’s glow forces a choice. Agency is present (kneel, lift, place), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; no tangible forfeiture beyond “memories no longer weighed on her.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed compassion emerges through the pendant’s journey rather than statement. Subtext rests in the alcove’s carvings of “love and loss” and the unspoken failure of the past priestess. Final image avoids moralizing; the humming blossoms reweight the premise quietly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Diction is lyrical yet controlled (“skeletal ribcage draped in wisteria”). Breath as motif threads through—slowing, steadying—modulating psychic distance with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; only two adjacent near-paraphrases (“her breath slowing, each inhale deeper”) slip into loop territory. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Strong verbs anchor the lyricism (“shimmered,” “seep,” “erupted”).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Camera-obscura artist detail is fresh but underused; the lens never constrains choice. Past-life/pendant twist feels inevitable in hindsight yet avoids cliché. Risk lies in lyric mode itself; it pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
