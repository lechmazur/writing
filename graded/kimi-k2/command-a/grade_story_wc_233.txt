<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The queen’s resolve is palpable, but interior contradiction is soft, expressed through generic “tremor in her chest” rather than embodied cost. The renunciation—shouldering guardianship of starlight—lands, yet the arc from dream-driven seeker to guardian feels told rather than dramatized; no micro-choice in the chamber reveals a visible shift in hierarchy of values. Interiority drifts between regal abstraction and folk wisdom (“fireflies in her heart”) without a distinctive voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal lens adopted: the grotto demands ascent, the voice confronts her with world-level price, and her explicit vow to restore balance forecloses a return to mere rule; the cascade of starlight and the softening glow provide on-page closure with felt cost. Occasional summary ascent beats—“each step a deliberate act”—slightly dilute link-by-link tension, but every consequential turn stems from her choice to climb deeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting delivers: the ridgeline height, metallic scent, and temperature shift all guide her climb and mirror the stakes. The starfall chamber is rendered as a pressure site, not postcard, and its bleeding silver directly triggers the guardian pact. Final reprise—“first fireflies of summer had vanished”—does not constrain choice, so capped below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The story signals early that cosmic balance is slipping; every beat of ascent tightens the queen’s confrontation with that debt. Her final acceptance of responsibility narrows every future option, landing cost on the page (“weight of her people’s deeds”). No new reversal within the grotto, but one decisive tightening satisfies the bar for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Guardianship versus exploitation emerges organically from the starlight revelation, but the voice’s overt exposition (“The truth is a burden…”) edges into theme statement, muting subtext. The closing vow carries resonance, yet the echo of advisors’ warning earlier reads slightly didactic rather than earned through specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; rhythm varies with breathless climb and interior weight. POV anchors firmly in the queen’s perceptions; no leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) is consistent with regal stance. The dialogue fragment with the starlight entity slips toward portentous declaration but stays within voice bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Language is vivid and propulsive; each sentence advances place or stakes. A few stacked modifiers (“molten silver waterfall”) graze overwriting but never break clarity or cadence. No repeated stems, loops, or contradictions; spatial choreography in the grotto is crisp. Final image of softened ember glow threads back without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>While “mystic cave that reveals cosmic truth” is familiar, the queen’s shift from personal dream-quest to planetary custodian reframes the trope. Specific, sensory grotto detail and the transmutation of bleeding starlight into ecological vow prevent the frame from feeling templated. Risk is moderate; payoff fresh enough but not startlingly so.</comment>
