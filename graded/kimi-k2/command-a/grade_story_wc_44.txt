<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet deliberation is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing grooves, etching runes—yet interiority occasionally drifts into explanatory summary (“a mystery that had eluded scholars”). The mentor’s absence is felt as pressure, but the vanishing itself is told more than dramatized, muting the relational crucible. Final renunciation of the key’s purpose lands with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: key → relearn runes → close loops → void absorbs shadows. Orientation is anchored early; only one transition (workshop → precipice) is cleanly marked. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost—the key’s glow extinguished, knowledge restored, world re-ordered. Minor ellipsis around mentor’s fate is motivated and does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating isle, nocturnal observatory, and brass key are rendered through selective sensory detail filtered by Elara’s scholarly gaze. The workshop’s frozen-in-time tableau and the precipice’s thinning air constrain her movements and choices. Spatial choreography is coherent; distances and tether strain are tracked without drift. Final image of light returning “untainted by darkness” recharges the setting as both stage and thematic mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and tested at the precipice. Escalation is a single tightening: shadows coalesce into void, forcing Elara to act. Cost is visible: the key’s glow dies, its purpose spent. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as both burden and key emerges through concrete events rather than statement. Subtext operates in the mentor’s absence and the key’s silence. Final image reframes the earlier “sealed awakenings” as cyclical absorption rather than apocalypse, inviting reflection without moralizing. Slight deduction for one explanatory clause (“a concept Elara had spent years studying”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Syntax and diction reflect her deliberate, scholarly cadence—measured, precise, occasionally latinate. No dialogue on page; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Final paragraph modulates to a quieter, contemplative rhythm that suits the earned stasis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences advance story or atmosphere without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“untainted by darkness”) fits the elevated stakes. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold phrase—“she realized”—could be trimmed, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of shadows being siphoned into a void at noon feels fresh, grounded in tactile rune-craft rather than generic magic. Mentor’s disappearance and key’s dual role as lock and lens avoid cliché. Synthesis of clockwork, runes, and celestial mechanics is specific to this world. Risk is moderate; could push further into the uncanny.</comment>
