<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembling,” “luminescent pulse”), but the shift from despair to resolve feels compressed; the grandmother backstory is brief yet anchored. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, and the final stance crystallizes without visible cost beyond the ache. Meets single-POV demands cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the redesigned card pattern reweights meaning, cost felt in the ache that becomes “guide, muse, truth.” Causal lens holds—each beat is “because therefore” linked to Elara’s sorting of cards. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Library-lighthouse is evoked with salt, dust, groaning shelves; the lantern room above acts as off-stage beacon that finally charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; the broken tarot box and scattered cards function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can she reassemble creative self?”—is signaled early and tightens as cards are rearranged. Agency is present in every beat; the Tower’s re-reading narrows options toward transformation. Cost is the luminescent ache that persists, but it is more stated than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of creation-through-destruction emerges organically from the Tower card and Elara’s act of redesign. Subtext lives in gesture (tracing cracked edges) rather than exposition. Final murmur reframes darkness as origin of light without moralizing. No motif checklist; resonance earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is painterly (“palette now lay dormant”). No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses under stress, longer reflective lines in calmer beats. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional elevated diction (“spectral presence,” “luminescent ache”) skirts purple but stays within Elara’s lexicon. No loops or scaffold; metaphors coherent. Final third clean of artifacts. Strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot-as-portfolio, lighthouse-as-prison, darkness-as-origin-of-light. Familiar tropes (broken heirloom, spiral ascent) are transformed through painter’s perceptual lens. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
