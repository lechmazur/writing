<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority and contradictions register ("creeping normality noticer" vs belief that ordinary hides sacred), embodied in guerrilla-garden micro-choices that visibly cost time, sweat, potential disappointment; plaque discovery tilts tactics and confirms worldview, reweighting absolution. Motivation stays legible throughout, flaws acknowledged implicitly, though renunciation is more quiet persistence than decisive foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Sequence of planting, plaque discovery, final candlelit repose creates a deepening rhythm rather than causal chain; closure takes form of earned stillness (Charged Poise) where possibility of absolution crystallizes against the garden, cost legible in dusk-falling labor and continued task ahead. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; no ambiguity late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Courtyard’s decay (crumbling statues, damp soil, plaque, lantern light) physically constrains planting tools, dictates angles of approach, and in final image recharges the earlier bread symbol; micro-setting (stone plaque) serves as pivot. Sensory specifics tethered to POV priorities ("scent of damp earth and fading blooms," "warm with chamomile and jasmine").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: locating/absolving the hidden sacred. No external antagonist; pressure is self-imposed doubt and entropy. One meaningful tightening: plaque unearthed → tactics shift → Elara chooses continued planting despite unproof. Cost paid is physical labor in waning light; option of surrender not taken, instead new covenant formed.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection-in-dailiness emerges organically through action, not sermons; bread and soil motifs re-weighted in final image, no explicit thesis. Subtext is the garden as secular sacrament; ambiguity preserved. However, plaque inscription ("sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary") edges too close to direct statement, limiting score.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Distinct lyrical texture with compact sensory economy; free indirect and present-sense imagery stay stable in single POV ("her fingers brushing," "unmistakable mark"). Non-standard diction ("creeping normality") is taught early and pays off. Micro-ellipses ("birds long since flown south") are legible. No dialogue to distort voice.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose carries read-aloud rhythm with variable sentence lengths; avoids template beats. High density lines ("ivy had choked out the light") do multiple jobs: obstacle, foreshadow, cost signal. Occasional near-duplicate imagery ("warm aroma," "warm glow") drifts mild but closure image ("lantern cast the courtyard…") remains clear. Minor line-level artifact: slight synonym loop on "warm" costs 0.2.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Keeps guerrilla-gardening trope but gives it spiritual stakes, grafts vanished-bread motif to sacramental economy; palace-overgrowth setting repurposed. Fresh inflection: sacred found in displaced bakery remains. Some broader garden-recovery tropes still legible but specificity of loaf and plaque re-weight the pattern. Derivative baseline −0.3; transformation recovers +0.3 to net positive.</question>
