<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara’s obsession with the slide is explicit, but her interiority flirts with therapist speak; contradictory impulses under pressure remain more asserted than embodied. The payoff—choosing to continue the timewoven legacy—arrives too smoothly, undercutting the visible cost required for earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—slide pulses → Mara steps inside, discovers chamber → new map redefines art and future. Yet the final shift feels more thematic announcement than culminating beat, lacking decisive stakes narrowed on-page under the Situational strain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Storm-wracked archway provides vivid anchor, salt scent, gradient pressure. Iconic but underleveraged: it constrains no tactical choice, merely frames scenes—solid world, modest payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reimagining through timewoven alliance—shapes Mara’s decision, yet escalation is once removed: she views the map rather than forcing a trade-off on-page. Pressure coheres in ending image, but cost is gestured rather than paid.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Theme surfaces as an elegant motiff of layered meanings bridging past/future, but emerges more through exposition than embodied conflict. Final resonance is present yet not vital: concept could re-phrase without rupture.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited handles perception shifts cleanly; “turbine-hum reverie” is composed in rhythmic repetition. Some filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moment dilute immediacy but voice remains distinct and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Elision and lyrical layering serve pressure; prose compresses without loop drift. Occasional elevated diction momentarily clashes with tactile driftwood voice in brief peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of driftwood sculptor, timewoven lanterns, and storm-gate offers fresh prism; synthesis feels specific rather than trope mash. Risk arrives via lyric mode and expands stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Introduces sculptor’s “spirited” stance early, but decisive beat is passive viewing of the map; swappable enthusiasm slot rather than pivot point. Cost linkage minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Magic lantern slide pulses at inciting beat and resurfaces to unlock chamber and create final map—two distinct beats with evolving meaning, fulfilling development and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“Timewoven alliances” phrase drives dive into chamber carvings and implied future alliances—tight concept integration across beats, though final payoff is thematic rather than option-changing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>“Perpetually learning” recurs as mantra (“Reimagine”) but merely backs thematic tilt; no visible trade-off or disabled attempt—label rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>“Reimagine” acts as mantra shaping final stance, though outcome feels narrated rather than dramatized. One clear closure tie-back keeps it above swappable level.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>“Layered meanings” frames interpretation, mentioned twice but not mechanized—obscure until final image; middle development gate missed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Archway gives spatial anchor and storm pressure; while vivid, it doesn’t narrow choices—environmental stage without tactical variation, fulfilling setup/payoff gates modestly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.4</grade>
<comment>“After GPS fails” introduced early yet temporal pressure remains loose; no sense of deteriorating timer—functional anchor, weak development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>“Scaffold complexity with simplicity” guides Mara’s claiming of legacy; motivation friction exists in potential against leaving gallery circuits, but not dramatized in scene—setup present, cost implied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>“Turbine-hum reverie” suffuses prose in poetic cadence early and late; tone modulates with pressure, ultimately recharging stakes in closing map display—solid but not transformative.</comment>
