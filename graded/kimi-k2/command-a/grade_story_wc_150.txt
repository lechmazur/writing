<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“her boots sinking into the soft earth”), but the shift from cautious curiosity to restored faith is more asserted than dramatized; the final beat lacks a visible cost that would make the change earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial base clicks into place and the mural reframes her exile as cyclical return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each unearthed shard thickens pattern until the final image reweights it—but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful; roots and bones constrain every step and echo the theme of life-death continuity. The sundial base itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost tradition to restore faith—is signaled early and tightens once when the tomb entrance is revealed. However, the escalation is driven more by setting than by protagonist choice, and the cost of opening the tomb is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orchard’s life-death braid and the sundial’s cyclical time; the mural offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Yet a touch of editorial summary (“she found what she had been searching for”) slightly dilutes the earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; compression and patterned elision (“roots themselves were pointing”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive, with strong verbs and sensory economy. Occasional soft loops (“she was not just excavating… she was unearthing”) and elevated diction (“diaspora returnee”) slightly dull immediacy, but no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard as living archive feels fresh; the sundial-mural linkage transforms a familiar homecoming arc into a cyclical restoration ritual. Specificity of place and object anchors the universal theme, though the diaspora frame is a known template.</comment>
