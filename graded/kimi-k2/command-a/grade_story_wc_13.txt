<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—she feels the pendant’s warmth, steps onto the ledge—but the “ability to sculpt time” is asserted rather than embodied; her final realization reads as epiphanic summary rather than earned contradiction. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The cost (she must leave the Heart) is stated but not dramatized in body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the canal labyrinth, glowing gate, and still pool layer density until the final image reweights “time as tapestry.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her sketchbook feels lighter, life now a “symphony”—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rooftop canal, serpentine spires, and cavern pool are vivid and selective; the canal literally bends to her will, constraining movement. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and temperature, matching an illustrator’s eye. Micro-setting (pendant as key) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost creative cadence—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the gate opens and the giant’s nap nears its end. Agency is present (she descends, dips her hand) but the cost of leaving is narrated rather than felt, capping escalation just below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time is not a commodity to capture but a rhythm to honor. The infinity motif evolves from heirloom to key to quiet reminder, reweighting its meaning without overt statement. Final image of sketchbook-as-symphony offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s perceptions; diction (“sketchbook clutched tightly,” “waters glinting”) reflects an illustrator’s visual bias. Rhythm modulates with urgency—short clauses on the ledge, longer cadences in the cavern. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is internal coherence only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional lyrical lifts (“time blurred; the sun hung eternally”) serve texture without overwriting. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“time slipped through her fingers” beside “tapestry to be woven”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy premise of canal-rooftops and giant’s nap feels fresh yet inevitable; the infinity pendant as literal key to time-sculpting is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking lies in the lyric-accumulative structure rather than plot twists, and it pays off in the final sketchbook image.</comment>
