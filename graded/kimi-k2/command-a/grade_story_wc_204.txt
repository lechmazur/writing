<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “compress eternity into a single, perfect moment” is stated early and revisited at the end, but the interior contradiction between order and chaos is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Her micro-choice to descend into the clouds is visible, yet the cost (loss of safety, identity shift) is only implied. Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstraction under pressure. Still, the arc from observer to caretaker is coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rupture → discovery → descent → re-visioning of the library. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the library pulses alive and Elara’s role crystallizes with felt awe. One minor drift: the bottled whisper’s agency is asserted rather than demonstrated, softening causality. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is rendered with selective, sensory precision—crystalline spires, shimmering panes, swirling clouds—and the setting actively reconfigures at closure, constraining Elara’s new identity. Frost patterns and the bottle serve as micro-settings that guide choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The environment’s shift from sanctuary to living entity charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: the tension between perfect order and negotiable reality. Escalation is textural: each shard (frost rupture, bottled whisper, cloud descent) deepens the pattern break. Agency is present—Elara steps off the platform—but the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image: order fracturing into living pattern. Subtext is carried by silence, light, and shifting glass. No moralizing; the final pulse of the library reweights the premise without statement. The ambiguity between caretaker and captive lingers effectively.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“shimmering panes,” “rustling awakenings.” Syntax modulates with wonder and vertigo. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter overload. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is selective and pattern-driven. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly,” “eternity”) edges toward grandeur but stays within Elara’s register. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating glass library, bottled whisper, and frost-code are synthesized into a fresh metaphysical frame. Familiar tropes (sentient archive, cloud-sea) are transformed through tactile specificity and Elara’s craft. The risk of abstraction is balanced by grounded sensory detail. One fresh inflection: the library’s final pulse redefines knowledge as organism.</comment>
