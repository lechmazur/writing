<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—quiet service toward collective intergenerational survival—defines every beat; her anonymous food runs and bell-announced gathering both reveal iron consistency and the cost of exposed identity. Interiority stays concrete (“the weight of her secret suddenly lighter”), though emotion tends stated rather than embodied. No contradiction or drift, yet the arc stops short of an earned flaw; the climax merely extends her existing ethic rather than challenging it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from anonymous provisions → rumour → public gathering → communal contract. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—bell–charged “amplified quiet” crystallizes unity with forefelt cost (loss of perfect anonymity). Orientation is clear by line 40. One prior expositional paragraph (~140 words backstory) escapes the BRR limit.</comment>

<comment>Terra-cotta arbor, cracked tiles with wind-borne whispers, and the bell as portable micro-setting ground every move. Sensory economy shifts—lantern glow replaces night chill once stakes turn from stealth to solidarity. No constraint contradiction; space remains coherent across three re-entries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—declared early. Tightening occurs when anonymity begins to fray, forcing Mara to trade invisibility for social cohesion; cost is the deliberate public exposure that ends future covert runs. No coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of legacy-through-solidarity emerges implicitly from food runs, bell-rings, and volunteered crafts. Final image of young girl and elder framing the bell offers non-didactic resonance, though a mild “this bell is a symbol” sentences scrapes the thematic echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Consistent close-third, lyrical yet intimate; perceptual bias live in filtered sensory choices (“wind whispered secrets”). Rhythmic control tightens under pressure: short declaratives during door-step encounter, longer wave paragraphs at the arbor. Dialogue limited but idiomatic; no voice leakage between speaker and narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose reads aloud cleanly; cadence adapts to shift from furtive night to communal ritual. Occasional elevated moments (“its terra-cotta walls bearing witness”) flirt with overwriting but echo theme. Small loop on “Midnight food runs… midnight food runs” in adjacent sentences; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Ghost-donor trope revitalized through tactile ritual and a bell as historical/plot hinge rather than metaphor bauble. Transformation succeeds: same bell once smuggled to exile, now smuggles exile into future. Risk lies in familiar NGO-gathering template, but idiosyncratic object focus offsets derivativeness.</comment>
