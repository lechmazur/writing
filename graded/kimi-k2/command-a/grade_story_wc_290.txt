<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia and prudence are embodied in the narrowing passage and trembling fingers, but the interior contradiction between fear and yearning is stated more than dramatized in the moment of crisis; the final “embrace the mutiny” shift feels slightly abstract rather than earned by a visible micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chamber’s expansion and the compass pointing outward crystallize a new stance with felt cost (claustrophobia faced). Causal linkage holds—compass guides, shard reconfigures space—though the spatial-mutiny rule is asserted more than demonstrated in mid-story beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Stone arch, narrowing passage, and crystalline shard are vivid and selective; the shard’s light charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent, but “shadowed nexus under starlight” remains a touch generic until the chamber contracts and expands.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key—tightens when walls contract and claustrophobia spikes; the cost is visceral (fear of entrapment). Agency drives the climax: Elara’s decision to yield to mutiny reshapes space. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of liberation-through-confinement emerges via spatial metaphor and father-memory motif; the organ’s unheard melody as code is a fresh angle. Final image avoids moralizing, but the “wistful rebellion” label in the last line edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias; syntax modulates with stress (“her breath catching,” “walls seemed to exhale”). No POV drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; occasional elevated diction (“metaphysical,” “specters”) slightly lifts out of Elara’s lexicon under pressure. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere. One mixed image—“veil between realms thinned”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Spatial mutiny as literalized claustrophobia inversion is a fresh synthesis; father’s compass and organ-code avoid stock tropes. Risk-taking in concept is coherent and legible, though the shard’s exact mechanics remain lightly sketched.</comment>
