<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is calm and embodied, but her shift from curiosity to stewardship is asserted rather than dramatized; the final communal act is off-stage, muting the cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s understanding reframes the oasis and her role—yet the causal chain from lantern-glass visions to village mobilization is elided, softening the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scorched oasis is rendered with tactile heat and dust; the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and ultimately charges the final image of communal light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the oasis’s story—emerges late; pressure tightens when the glass aligns with sunset, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of kindness as temporal glue emerges organically from the glass’s phototropic logic and the oasis’s layered memories; the final glow offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s calm, sensory focus; diction is precise and rhythmic, though occasional lyrical lifts edge toward the poetic-generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; a few soft repetitions (“thrum,” “glow”) and elevated cadences nudge it short of flawless density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>The fusion of zen potter, phototropic lantern, and fractured beekeeping timelines feels fresh; the kindness-as-light motif transforms familiar eco-hope tropes into a specific, earned vision.</comment>
