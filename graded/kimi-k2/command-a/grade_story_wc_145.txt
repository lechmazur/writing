<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's quest is lucid: every reflection pivots back to "rivers' source"; the final kneel reconfigures the atlas into a living flow. Interiority rings—"not of joy but of understanding" is earned and embodied. Minor drift: the phrase "dog-eared phrasebook" recurs too often without fresh action. Yet the cost stands—renunciation of mapping for lived witness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens declared: falcon return → lake anomaly → stream found. The pattern of condensation seeds the climactic mist line; the loop is taught and paid off. Closure is Earned Stasis in which Elara writes a new “source” into the phrasebook; the atlas is closed in favor of living flow. One small ellipsis: off-stage falcon courier status stays unaddressed.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen lake, fissured ice, and sub-glacial current are rendered with tactile immediacy: cracked glare ice, mist line, faint vibration. Environment constrains every move—boots sink, gloves numb, stream resists mapping. Visual repetitions (“surface cracked and gleaming” echoed later as “cracked and gleaming under pale winter sun”) slightly dampen specificity.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake signaled at opening: pinpointing river origins. Mid-stream tightening: lake surface anomaly forces direct investigation; choice costs time and body heat in sub-zero. Final narrowing: observation becomes renunciation—cannot chart what must be felt running over her gloved hand. Falcon coincidence is complication, not resolution.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of cartography versus lived origin emerges without overt statement; the atlas turns from authority to artifact to blank page. The final silent inscription—“the language of the river itself”—is a resonant CR reweighting global stakes. One slight drift: phrasebook as talisman borders on symbol.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Elegant third-limited lyrical voice—“worrying tranquility,” “veins of a map”—that modulates seamlessly from interior to landscape. No dialogue so no register clash; syntactic pulse mimics Elara’s cerebral drift into embodied engagement. Occasional filler prepositional chains ("its surface cracked and gleaming under the pale winter sun") slacken tempo.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with sensory layering and minimal redundancies. One repetitive syntactic slot—“as she...” pattern thrice—slightly dulls rhythm. No significant artifact obscuring cause; occasional elevated metaphor (“bridges between the languages of the world”) safely within lyrical license.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Fresh turn: an atlas editor abandons definitive maps for subterranean rivers. Tropes (falcon, phrasebook, mist line) are bent through cartographer’s lens. No direct echo or template crib. Stakes remain personal rather than globe-saving, protecting plausibility and originality.</question>
