<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her paradoxical identity and bodily poetics are embodied in the thread-untangling—but the “chaste courtesan” label never complicates her tactics; no sexual or social risk is felt. The final smile registers cost, yet the prior beats lack contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s awakening is legible and irreversible, charged by the released echoes. Causal chain holds—untangling threads → door opens → dance releases voices—though the “how” of thread-magic remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides movement and stakes; the crystalline walls refract starlight into the final image, reweighting the setting’s promise. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defy conformity via the harvest—is signaled early and tightened by each untangled thread; the final dance crystallizes the cost as the city stirs. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of individuality vs. complacency emerges organically through the echoes’ release; no moralizing statement intrudes. The snowflakes carrying fragments of voice provide a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and perceptual signature (“every flake seemed to whisper secrets”). No head-hopping; diction stays within the elevated fairytale register taught from the opening line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional poetic layering (“time stretched between sigh and smile”) risks overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion-against-conformity frame is refreshed by the courtesan-echoes synthesis and the bodily-poetic unlocking ritual. Specificity of thread-memories and prism refraction lifts it above template.</comment>
