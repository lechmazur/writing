<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s gift and motivation are sketched early and remain consistent; the moment he lifts the mainspring barrel and feels the chill embodies the contradiction between curiosity and dread. His final act—inserting the barrel—earns a credible renunciation of his own safety for the ghosts’ release, though interiority is sometimes generic (“weightless burden” label). No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, a solid arc but not yet razor-sharp.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s restart heals the building and frees the ghosts, with Marcus left holding the cost of perpetual vigilance (“cracks always reappeared”). Causal chain—barrel → clock → release—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. Minor lens wobble early (textural vs causal) but settles on causal by midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office is evoked through selective sensory hits—sawdust scent, flickering fluorescents, dust patterns—filtered by Marcus’s technician gaze. The ceiling void and clock serve as micro-setting that constrains the final insertion. Details feel lived-in, though “crumbling reminder of forgotten joy” edges cliché. Meets 9- gate: the clock in the rafters directly shapes the closing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover what the ceiling hides—tightens once when the girl-ghost points upward, forcing Marcus onto the counter. Cost is visible: he risks the unknown darkness above. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-ghostly. One clear escalation beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of repair versus release emerges organically: Marcus fixes the clock but accepts the endless return of cracks. Subtext lingers in the image of perpetual caretaking. Avoids explicit moralizing, though “weightless burden” edges toward label-speak. Resonant but not yet haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus; perceptual signature is technician-lean (“methodical approach,” “diagnose elevator malfunctions”). Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during ceiling breach. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“gravitational force”) slightly jars.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; sentences advance image or action. Minor loop: “faint whispers… whispers grew louder” within three lines. No mixed metaphors or purple patches. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resonance cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Combines elevator tech with ghost-whisperer in a circus ruin—fresh synthesis. The mainspring barrel as literal heart of both clock and haunting is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Avoids trope checklist; emotional specificity grounds the fantastical. Small risk taken, pays off.</comment>
