<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation (“meaning in the margins”) stays consistent; micro-choice to trace chalk, extract letter, and smile before leaving shows earned renunciation with felt cost of dawn catching her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: dawn light arrives while Lyra holds the letter; the “futuristic nostalgia” image re-configures her path. Causality holds with one transition (arcade → mailbox) and no gaps; constraints (mailbox flag, dawn deadline) shape tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Golden arcade, chalk drawings, red-flag mailbox are vivid and specific; they guide proximity (arcade edge) and temporal pressure (flag position). Lacks a deeper environment or tool constraint that charges final beat, so 6.8, not 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode margin-messages before mailing—signal early and escalate via coordinates in chalk → letter deadline → dawn arrival with felt cost (sunrise). One tightening via mailbox retrieval under clock pressure is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Theme of “persistence of memory within acceleration” emerges from tangible mail vs digital erosion, crystallized in Lyra’s wistful smile at dawn; avoids direct statement. Quiet resonance lands without moralization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays in Lyra’s selective perception (“eyes catching…too deliberate”). Lexicon controlled; syntactic rhythm rises with urgency (“time was running out... heart quickened”). Voice modulation under stress evident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Prose clear, vivid, concise; occasional lifted phrases (“masterpiece of cryptic communication”) flirt with overwriting but stay within band. Minimal scaffolds, no loops; propulsive sentence-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: nostalgic postal artifacts encoded in children’s chalk, arcade at dawn as liminal space between analogue and digital. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight risk but retains clarity.</comment>
