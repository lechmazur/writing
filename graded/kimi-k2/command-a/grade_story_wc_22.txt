<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coachman’s motive—garden reclaiming battlefield—is clear and embodied in the kneeling, seeding micro-choice. Interiority stays concrete (weathered hands, creaking knees) but leans toward lyrical summary rather than contradictory impulse in scene. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Earned stasis feels present yet cost is more asserted (“weight of centuries”) than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: coachman drives off leaving a living promise; the image reweights the jetty from loss to hope with conceptual cost (time, solitude). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of seed, bird-call, twilight deepens until final cadence shift. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks. Closure cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blooming jetty, salt-stink, and creaking wood are vivid and selective. Environment constrains the only possible action—planting on ruined timber—charging the final image. Micro-setting (seed pods, soil between planks) functions as tactile “setting” that alters tactics. Twilight progression tracks cleanly across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform death to life—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the act of fertilizing forecloses the option to abandon the jetty; cost is the coachman’s solitary endurance. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals, but deepening suffices. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-decay emerges organically from seed pods, dead reef, and dead languages. Final image of carriage disappearing into night offers non-literal answer: hope persists in hidden labor. Avoids overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext carried by bird-calls and twilight rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured—“twilight’s embrace,” “narrow vastness”—without purple drift. Syntax modulates with emotional rise and fall. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. POV stays tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction fits mythic register and is sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is fluid, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor scaffold: “a little brighter, a little greener, a little more alive” is near-paraphrase loop. Metaphors stay coherent. No artifacts in closure beat. Strong sensory specificity and purposeful paragraphing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic gardener who speaks extinct tongues via bird augury feels fresh and grounded. Transformation of ruined jetty into garden stakes a non-obvious angle on eco-grief. Risk-taking in quiet lyric mode pays off; no gimmicks. Could edge higher if conceptual cost were sharper.</comment>
