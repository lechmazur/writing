<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“clutched the artifact,” “senses attuned to the planet’s whispers”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final acceptance of guardianship feels more declared than earned, lacking a visible renunciation or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow tip’s restoration crystallizes Elara’s new purpose under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds, yet the cost is only implied (“journey far from over”) rather than felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and bioluminescent moss are selective, sensory, and tied to navigation; the arch interior’s emerald glow constrains the hologram reveal. Still, the planet’s rules (gravity inversion) are more spectacle than tactical constraint at the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planet’s resilience fading—is signaled early and tightens when echoes dim. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elara realizes the grove’s role, but the cost of restoration is off-loaded to the planet rather than borne by her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of symbiosis between memory and growth emerges organically through the plants-as-archives conceit. Final image of “whirling silence now alive with the planet’s song” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“shimmering river,” “veins of bioluminescent moss”) is textured and consistent. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narrative rhythm, which modulates well with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional poetic layering (“world tilted, but she remained steady”) serves mood. One scaffold loop—“the arrow tip pulsed… the arrow tip flared”—dulls momentum slightly but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The orchard planet’s inverted gravity and memory-laden flora synthesize familiar eco-SF tropes into a fresh, specific ecology. The broken arrow tip as living compass is an inventive pivot that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
