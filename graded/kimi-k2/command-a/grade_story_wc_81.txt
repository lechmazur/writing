<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers brushing the spines,” “dappled resolve”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final choice to press the stamp feels inevitable rather than costly, so the Earned Stasis is only partially felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamp’s glow reweights the library from repository to gateway. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each discovery layers density until the blackout’s stripping-away catalyzes revelation. Cost is the isolation and the irreversible opening of hidden passages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and selective (“water lapped at the edges of crumbling stone,” “bioluminescent algae”), and the map-room micro-setting constrains the final alignment. Yet the city’s broader geography remains abstract, capping the score just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering honest origins—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout strips distractions. One meaningful deepening occurs as the map reveals the library as gateway. Cost is legible (isolation, irreversible passage opening), but the pressure curve is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus curated history emerges organically through Elara’s tactile discoveries; the final illumination reframes prior symbols without moralizing. Subtext in the stamp’s glow and shifting walls carries conceptual cost, though the aftereffect is more cerebral than visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve”) that modulates under pressure. POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct. Occasional elevated diction (“tranquilly perceptive”) edges toward register drift but stays within tolerable bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, with strong nouns and verbs. Minor scaffold appears (“her mind racing with possibilities” echoes earlier phrasing), and one mixed metaphor (“restless energy stirred within her—a dappled resolve”) slightly muddles embodiment. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sunken-library-as-gateway premise feels fresh, synthesized through Elara’s indexing lens. Familiar tropes (hidden map, magical stamp) are transformed by the blackout-as-catalyst device. Specificity of algae-lit corridors and stamp-etched foundations anchors the concept.</comment>
