<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"eyes burned with a purpose that defied captivity," chains as both burden and crucible—but reliance on heroic archetype dilutes flaw; choice to descend and renounce extra jars feels more dutiful than frictive, so contradictions flatten rather than clash. Emotional specificity slips into lyrical summary rather than embodied panic under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: chains falling away equals Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—future labor now foreclosed to the liberator’s own endurance. Chain linkage across beats because/therefore, yet early orientation soft (who controls vault, who built wall not legible) and ladder snag moment is off-stage micro-blip rather than on-page setback.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dust, rust, and the carnival’s cringingly creaked Ferris wheel anchor place with sensory precision; vault floorboards and arrow key code function as micro-setting constraints that alter tactics. The carnival’s prior exuberance remains a ghost texture rather than a live weight on choice, slightly throttling its charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeds equal future survival—signaled early; wall-collapse clock supplies coherent pressure intensifying mid-escape beat. Escalation is single-torque rather than deepening: men close in, ladder snag, run, chains release. Cost is conceptual (personal labor henceforth) more than viscerally felt in breath or wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience blooms implicitly from seed image and liberator’s stoic endurance; no moralizing. Yet the final paragraph gently sermonizes “gesture of defiance against a dying world,” a 0.4 slip that tempers thematic heft. Symbolic arrow buried with seeds reprises promise without reweighting meaning or price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Moody poetic voice maintains diction suited to the liberator’s internal frame—measured, almost ritual. Occasional lofted syntax (“staggering grace…quiet triumph”) risks elevated register drift yet remains consistently in service of the moment’s grandeur. No dialogue, so naturalism tension absent by design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Rhythm propels without loops; figurative layering is selective—“chains clinking like a macabre rhythm”—but “staggering grace” reprise pushes toward purple without adding new sensory bite. Information density high; no scaffold redundancy, small −0.2 for mixed metaphor of “shadows dragging anchors” in closing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Seed vault inside carnival prize booth is a fresh synthesis, transforming faded fun-park decay into post-drought seed mythos. Chains-to-planting arc repurposes prison imagery as agricultural destiny. Arrow as cipher key is inventive, though code mechanism abstract. Risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
