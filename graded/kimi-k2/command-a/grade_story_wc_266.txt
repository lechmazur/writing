<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured—her boots echoing, the ticket frayed—but the “unused courage” remains an abstract label rather than a felt contradiction; the ferryman’s younger self appears too late to pressure her choice, so the final transfer of the star stamp reads symbolic rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank ticket and air-punch reconfigure meaning with visible cost—the star now inside her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the ridgeway’s mist and indirect route tighten the cadence toward this crystallized moment without causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway’s mist and salt air are selective and atmospheric, guiding perception; the ticket punch as micro-setting constrains the final beat. Spatial tracking is clean, but the ridgeway itself never actively obstructs or enables choice, keeping it just shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is signaled early and narrows to the single act of traversing; the indirect route and deepening twilight escalate tension. Yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image rather than statement: the star stamp migrating from paper to self reweights the premise. The vigil motif threads subtly, but the final “vigil is over” edges toward explicit echo, slightly dulling resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; sensory diction (“salt and secrets,” “shoreline lullaby”) is consistent and character-bound. No POV drift, and the compression in the final ascent matches rising breathlessness. Dialogue is minimal but tonally apt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined, though “leash had broken” is a stock metaphor. Sentence variety supports the climb’s cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The twilight vigil and star-stamped ticket feel fresh in combination; the ferryman’s dual-age appearance offers a subtle uncanny turn. Risk is moderate—lyric rather than structural—but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
