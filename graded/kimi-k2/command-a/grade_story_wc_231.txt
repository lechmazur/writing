<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his fixation on gaps, the boutonnière as trust, the journal as burden—but the decisive shift to “keep them safe” is more stated than dramatized; we feel the weight but don’t see the immediate cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the mist thickens, the boot-print appears, the journal surfaces, each beat layering density until the final beam cuts through. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s stance crystallizes with felt cost, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam are vivid and selective; the boutonnière and journal act as micro-settings that constrain Elias’s final choice. The Edelweiss scent threading through the mist charges the ending image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—tightens as each clue (print, journal) narrows Elias’s options. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the final cost is more intellectual than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memory and isolation emerges organically from Elias’s handling of the journal; the final image of the beam reframes the boutonnière as legacy without moralizing. Subtext in the stranger’s fragmented entries deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific—“mist clung like a second skin,” “salt and something floral.” No POV drift; compression and patterned elision serve the Accumulative design and are legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft phrases (“softly persistent reminder”) flirt with redundancy but never stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The borrowed-memory premise is familiar, yet the integration with lighthouse ritual, Edelweiss token, and accumulative mist pattern feels fresh. The final reweighting of the boutonnière as trust rather than clue lifts it above template.</comment>
