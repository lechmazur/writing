<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “tremor of certainty” is felt yet not embodied in a specific, contradictory micro-choice until the final surrender. The renunciation of prior boundaries is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Voice remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet’s surrender to the quartz song dissolves self-boundaries and reweights the world. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift carry the arc. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake are rendered with selective, synesthetic detail that constrains movement and charges the final image. The quartz colonnade functions as both setting and active agent. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—permission to transcend artistic limits—is signaled early and tightened through the poet’s escalating surrender to the quartz. One meaningful deepening: the ice cracks and lifts, mirroring internal dissolution. Cost is legible in the final hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred transgression emerges organically from the poet’s embodied experience; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the singing colonnade reweights the premise without statement. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—poet’s synesthetic bias colors every image. No POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language rarely repeats without payoff. One minor paraphrase loop (“humming quartz… sang softly”) is offset by cadence shift. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses lyric portal fantasy with artistic self-transcendence; the quartz colonnade as living archive feels fresh. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if setting or method were swapped. Risk in lyric mode is justified by coherence.</comment>
