<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—her compulsion to bear others’ burdens versus the calcifying cost to her own soul—is embodied in the tightening grip on the lamp burner. The final choice to weave her own pattern is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the fissure in her calcified layers). The figure’s pressure crystallizes her stance, but the figure itself remains too archetypal to deepen status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s decision to weave her own fractal map reconfigures her options and stakes under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the “crack form within her” and the lamp’s steadier flame. Orientation is anchored early; the whalebone-reverie voice teaches its pattern and pays off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto’s damp earth, metallic tang, and starlight mosaic are filtered through Elara’s selective attention, grounding her ritual. The lamp burner evolves from grounding object to mirror of her resolve, constraining her final choice. Micro-setting (body + tool) charges the closure image. No spatial drift or white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elara will keep bearing others’ burdens or confront her own—is signaled early. The figure’s offer tightens the pressure once, forcing a trade-off. Cost is visible in the fissure and the lamp’s brighter burn. Agency remains internal; the external figure is catalyst, not resolver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the cost of vicarious empathy versus self-knowledge. The shingled hush motif reweights from external silence to internal reckoning. Subtext resides in gesture (tightened grip, steadier flame) rather than declaration. Final image avoids moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s sensory hierarchy (damp earth, metallic tang) and fractal diction remain hers alone. No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but tonally apt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“calcified within her”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final cadence crystallizes without overwriting. Minor elevation in diction fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The fractal-weaver conceit is fresh, transforming the trope of empathic burden into literalized calcification. The bronze grotto and whalebone reverie feel specific to this voice. The final reconfiguration—self-weaving—grows inevitably from prior particulars. Slight archetype in the shadow-figure tempers the score.</comment>
