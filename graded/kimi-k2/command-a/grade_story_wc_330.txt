<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The carpenter’s interiority is embodied in calloused hands and the warmth of the fragment, but his contradictory impulses (silence vs. song) are stated rather than dramatized until the final beat. The choice to sing is credible yet arrives more as mystical compulsion than earned struggle. Still, the cost—his reclaimed voice—lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored carousel crystallizes the new possibility born from silence. Causal chain is thin—fragment summons song, song awakens carousel—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of hush → chime → song → light. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The train’s rusted wheels, misting hush, and verdant oasis are vivid and selective, filtering through the carpenter’s tactile craft. The carousel itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act. Weather and scent guide movement; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem silence into possibility—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: fragment’s warmth compels song, which costs the safety of muteness. No external antagonist; escalation is internal and mystical, yet the price is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-beginning emerges organically from the carpenter’s craft and the carousel’s resurrection. Final image of the pendant’s whispering gleam offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the warming fragment, the creaking horses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to the carpenter’s perceptual bias; diction is wood-and-metal tactile. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during discovery, longer lyrical flow during song. No dialogue, so voice coherence is high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with occasional lyrical lift (“tapestry of forgotten dreams”) that stays within POV. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance. One mixed metaphor (“misting hush deepened”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Abandoned-circus-train oasis is fresh, yet the halo fragment and singing-to-life motif flirt with familiar magic. Specificity of the carpenter’s muteness and craft transforms the trope. Risk is moderate; payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
