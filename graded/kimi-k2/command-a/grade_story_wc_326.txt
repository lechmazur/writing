<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat counting, tactile memory of the shard—but the “digital ghost” remains abstract, never forcing a micro-choice that alters tactics. The final renunciation (death certificate no longer defines her) is earned, yet the ghost’s guidance feels more thematic than interpersonal pressure. Competence balanced with struggle is present, but the flaw/choice link could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the inkblot data → defragment → ghost reveal chain is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s glow and dawn light crystallize her new stance with felt cost (“tears welled”). Orientation is clear by 120 words. Minor drift: the ghost’s causal weight is more tonal than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Frosted observatory dome, aged-wood scent, and snow-muffled silence create immediate texture. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, constraining her attention and later glowing to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather and isolation subtly raise stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove she’s alive—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: inkblot → defragment → ghost reveal narrows options from “solve error” to “accept erased timeline.” Cost is felt in the tearful recognition of paths untaken. Agency is cerebral, not physical, but still forecloses the old identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “wisdom from failure” emerges through the shard’s fracture and the ghost’s erased timeline, avoiding direct statement. Subtext in the shard’s hum and ink’s patterns invites reflection without moralizing. Final image of dawn over snow reweights the premise: survival is redefined as integration with the ghost, not victory over the system.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; no head-hopping. Diction is precise—“opal observatory,” “jagged like a broken promise”—and rhythm modulates with her heartbeat. Dialogue is absent, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“galaxies in miniature”) are vivid yet controlled. Sentence variety supports the midnight hush and sudden data flares. Clean grammar and pronoun reference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combines bureaucratic glitch, digital afterlife, and heirloom shard in a fresh synthesis. The observatory-as-memory-archive feels specific rather than generic. Risk is moderate—quiet sci-fi lyricism—but the emotional specificity keeps it from cliché.</comment>
