<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Veiled dreamer’s interiority is embodied through tactile micro-choices (tightening watch grip, following hum), but her flaw—caution overpowering hope—grows rather than constrains at climax, lowering the charge slightly. Earned stasis works, yet feels lightly charted under short length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Causal drive (Situational → Causal hybrid) holds: each move from mist gate → cipher shelf → quill moment tightens options toward the staged revelation. Closure lands with visible cost—her shifting stance becomes charged poise under library light. Orientation clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Glowing library as micro-setting actively constrains spatial navigation and supplies the cipher’s medium; mist limits retreat paths. Details selective (electric scent, crawling symbols) enrich rather than overwhelm, though no bodily or prop-level anchor goes beyond decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access redemptive truth—ratchets through humming code and time leak in ticking watch. Escalation causal: each decipher step slices options until final act of inscription forecloses passive stance. Felt cost (future custodianship) legible, though external pressure is soft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of unspoken words accrues via embodied library and chosen transcription; subtext heavy in shifting symbol language. Resonant reconfiguration emerges through cyclical yet reversed text—non-literal answer that reframes silence as active burden. Avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sensory diction distinct (“pulsed with ethereal light”, “tang of electricity”) mirrors POV urgency without slipping to purple. Patterned elision—blank watch face holding stopped time—taught early and rewarded at closure, maintaining lyrical control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose lean and propulsive; each sentence advances motive or tension. One minor filter-verb scaffold (“felt warm against her palm”) preempts deeper risk; otherwise zero loops. Rhythm flexes with stress without muddling closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of “library as living archive” and time-reversed watch fuses genre trope with lyrical restraint; transformation test passed—story fails without cipher-tablet logic. Slight risk of near-echo to well-trod mythic libraries, but local specifics offset.</comment>
