<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers paused, as if sensing an interrupted cadence”), but the piece leans on summary rather than micro-choice under pressure; the final act of adding the monarch wing feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradiction. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral with monarch wing crystallizes Elara’s stance, reconfiguring the stake of remembrance with felt cost (“their message would linger”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of building-then-departing structures tightens once. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Grotto’s moss, vines, filtered light are vivid and selective; the moth wing and spiral serve as micro-setting objects that constrain the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities—texture of moth wing, sound of wind—without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring vanishing monarch histories—signaled early; pressure deepens through scarcity of butterflies. No external antagonist; escalation is accumulative density of absence. Final image forecloses further building for now, with visible cost of leaving the fragile signal behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of transience vs. remembrance emerges from spiral construction and monarch absence, never stated. Subtext carried by moth wing’s fragility and Elara’s hum. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Some residual abstraction in “stories they carried” keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“esoteric realist,” “blushing stillness”) is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with scene—longer sentences for stillness, clipped fragments when she senses the cadence break. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged on narrative texture alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Occasional soft filler (“as though the world was holding its breath”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph earns its quiet cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-grief territory refreshed by the grotto-above-clouds frame and the conceit of temporary structures as memory signals. Moth-wing-as-transformation motif avoids cliché through tactile specificity. Risk is moderate; concept feels inevitable rather than startling.</comment>
