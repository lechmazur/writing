<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s motive is stated but not embodied in micro-choices; the mechanical arm is decorative rather than constraining. The final renunciation (“destination…within him”) is earned by dialogue logic, not by visible cost. Interiority is abstract (“dignified chaos”) rather than embodied contradiction. Relationship pressure with Mara is hinted but never crystallizes into a choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the overture becomes the act of questioning itself, with a felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (sundial, needle card, brook) reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening: shift from seeking hidden music to embracing the process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Glass atrium and brook are vivid and selective; light fracturing across stone subtly mirrors the fracturing of certainty. The sundial’s angles and the needle card are integrated into action rather than backdrop. No environmental constraint alters tactics, preventing 9-band entry, but the setting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the overture—tightens once when Elias reframes the quest from destination to process. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens. No visible forfeiture or tool loss, limiting upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: questions are the music. Subtext lives in gesture (mechanical arm twitch, spectacles adjustment) and silence. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perceptual signature is cerebral, fitting philosopher POV. Rhythm modulates with debate intensity. Dialogue carries subtext (“Silence is absence, not presence”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, lyrical without purple overload. Sentence variety supports momentum. Occasional abstract phrasing (“labyrinth of uncertainty”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fencing with philosophical axioms via sundial angles is fresh. Transformation of “hidden overture” from music to process feels inevitable. No close echoes; risk is conceptual rather than structural. Specificity of Danish needle card adds texture.</comment>
