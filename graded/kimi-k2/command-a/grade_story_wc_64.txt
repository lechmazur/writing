<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his fingers “tenderly organized around a trowel” and the tapestry decoding is tactile—but the final beat is a soft epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path; no visible cost is paid, so the arc feels slightly under-earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silo becomes “a cathedral” and the tapestry’s meaning reweights Elias’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence tighten toward the final image—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, chess clock, and tapestry fragment all function as micro-settings that constrain action; the silo’s shelves and ticking clock shape Elias’s focus, and the tapestry’s border literally guides his fingers. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though the cemetery itself remains more atmospheric than active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the tapestry to give voice to the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through pattern recognition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last thread is untangled, crystallizing Elias’s vocation. Cost is present but abstract; no tangible loss or forfeiture is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as an act of love that outlives death. The tapestry’s emotional map and the cemetery’s graves echo this without overt statement. Final image of “stars shimmer brighter” offers a non-literal, resonant answer, though it leans slightly sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-specific—“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No dialogue, so focus is on internal texture; free indirect style is clean. Occasional elevated diction (“cathedral,” “humanity”) slightly strains the gardener’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, with strong sensory specificity and minimal loops. A few stacked metaphors (“velveteen gloom,” “sentinel under the stars”) flirt with overwriting but remain legible. No artifacts in the closure beat; momentum is sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cemetery caretaker + emotional cartography via antique tapestry feels fresh and specific. The sovereign case and tapestry are not mere props; they reconfigure Elias’s sense of purpose. Risk is moderate—quiet lyricism rather than structural daring—but the angle is non-obvious.</comment>
