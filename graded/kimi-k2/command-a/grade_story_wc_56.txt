<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (unearth lies) is vivid, and her interiority shows contradictory impulses when she weighs salvaging the barge vs rushing ahead. The sundial glow and pulsing heartbeat tie object to embodied stakes. A micro-choice—salvaging the chest—earns redefinition of tactics. Cost is legible, though momentary, limiting the height of the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal through-line: the sundial’s glow triggers the salvage → journal revelation → truth key. Closure emerges when the canal’s image reconfigures from decay to possibility in the final sunrise, with concrete cost. Orientation is anchored early; minor ellipsis around how the chest was hidden is allowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Canal provides decaying barge as micro-setting that pressures choice—rotting wood forces caution. Specific details (moss, distant hum of machinery) texture scene. Yet setting is more backdrop than raw constraint; a stronger use would heighten stakes through accessible tool or terrain routing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake understood: reveal truth/reveal lies. Salvage beat advances this by unlocking journal confession. Escalates when sundial glow reflects codified truth, tightening choices. Cost visible in emotional weight but not yet paid in action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through artifact → journal → reweighted canal at sunrise without explicit statement. Subtext in captain’s regret charges final image. No tidy moral; complexity retained. Reprising canal imagery crystallizes resonance in earned poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical voice (decaying barge...world holding breath). Perceptual signature tight to Elara’s selective noticing. Compression in peak beats, e.g., “thoughtfully clear,” tightens under pressure. Minimal dilation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Prose deliberate with rhythm shifts (short beats vs. image-rich lines). Density in emotions like “faint hum” and “crystallized truth.” Minor synonym churn (“world seemed…world now”) pulls focus for a beat. Key beats clear, no obscuring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: salvage → journal → sundial revelation. Not wildly inventive canal, but the charged reprise of canal as rejuvenated possibility is non-trivial. Transformation is felt through character re-envisioning future rather than tourist updating of world.</comment>
