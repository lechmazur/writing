<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for past glory while fearing vulnerability—is embodied in tactile micro-choices and peaks in the folding of the speaker grille; the renunciation feels earned and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal through-line holds: every beat is motivated (appraisal failure → quarry retreat → grille reckoning) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—confidence recast as hope—delivered on the last line with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quarry office’s hum of fluorescent decay and diesel dust becomes an embodied constraint (window and grille pressed to glass), charging the final image without over-describing; sound and grit tighten the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding post-failure purpose—pressures every choice; the deepening comes when Elias chooses to “wrest” the story back, narrowing options from passive insulation to active re-creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the mute grille moving from relic to bridge embodies the echo-valley longing and offers a non-literal answer to after-the-applause silence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices sound as absence, sees “jagged edges scar the earth”—and rhythmic control under emotional crescendo; lyric compression taught early and paid off returns double pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clean, propulsive lines (every sentence acts) free of cliché loops; selective metaphors (grille as bridge) remain concrete and earned; minor density increase in reflective pools never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The “after the applause” lens reframed as quiet reckoning is fresh; while roadie-to-appraiser is familiar, the quarry-speaker constellation delivers non-obvious synthesis that tightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
