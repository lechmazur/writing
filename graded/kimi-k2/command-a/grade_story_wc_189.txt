<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s need to “touch” time is clear from the grotto frame, yet interior contradiction feels distilled rather than dramatized; the choice to accept cyclical connectedness at closure earns its visible emotional cost through the cicada’s reweighted hum rather than any fresh micro-choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is an earned stasis—Elara foregoes linear proving to merge with the tapestry; the causality bridge loops neatly from mentor dispute → scary specific gift → revalued gift in final image, satisfying Accumulative/Textural linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rippling starlight and moss anchor orientation fast; the grotto’s silence is more than tableau—it makes surveillance artifacts, a sensory constraint that seeds later silence-as-pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael’s remote accusation provides the only external pressure, but Elara’s internal escalation (from chronicler to component) turns the lack of direct confrontation into an existential stake rather than empty quarrel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>tangential-approach-as-method resolves from subtext rather than didactically; cumulative layers let “detours” become the only path to texture, ending in a quiet chronicle map that resonates without lecturing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence holds under pressure; named objects and silence become rhythmic tools, with cicada ≈ heartbeat a clear sensory signature without text loops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Gently compressed sentences avoid over-ornament; one info-dense stream drops a visual of stars as “celestial tapestry” without clogging the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Nominal but fully embodied concepts—time as stitched tapestry, silence as medium—feel fresh in the moment and permit a quiet rupture of generic chronicle form without gimmick.</comment>
