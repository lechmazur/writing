<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives (“carve a path from ruin to reverence”) are stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; her sleepwalking method is asserted, not tested. The final stance is serene but the cost is diffuse—no visible forfeiture or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canyon glows with embedded stories, reconfiguring the ruined space into reverence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sewn image layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is implied in lifelong dedication, but not dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, tide-pool cracks, and etched plates are vividly rendered and filter through Elara’s poetic perception. The labyrinth constrains her looping paths, and the transformed walls charge the final image. Sensory selection favors the visual; other senses are underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore desolation to reverence—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through each sewn image, but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The tightening is tonal rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken precedents emerges through the act of sewing memory into stone. The orchid-solace motif returns in the final glow, reweighting ruin as living archive. Subtext is present but occasionally drifts toward overt statement (“testament to the power of perseverance”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled cadence and poetic diction that suits the wharf-weaver persona. Occasional elevated phrasing (“hauntingly optimistic aura”) edges toward thesaurus drift but remains coherent. No POV leakage or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Minor paraphrase loops (“each step was deliberate, each movement a stitch…”) and stacked modifiers slightly dilute momentum. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of sleepwalking cartography with textile memory feels fresh. Transformation of a labyrinth into a living story-gallery is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; concept could travel with different names, but specificity of “orchid solace” and tide-pool absence anchors it.</comment>
