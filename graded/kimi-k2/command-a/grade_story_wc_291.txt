<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied in her charcoal sketching and ribbon tracing, but the interior contradiction between “seeing beyond features” and literal inability to recognize faces is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final shift—empathy awakened through art—feels more declared than earned; no visible cost or irrevocable choice seals the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait of the quarry crystallizes Elara’s stance and reweights the cold case from puzzle to empathic bridge. Causality is mostly Accumulative/Textural; the ribbon fragments and mist build density rather than drive because/therefore turns. One tightening beat—the figure’s appearance—complicates but does not foreclose options; the ending drifts rather than decisively alters the path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The quarry’s mist, jagged stone, and chill air are filtered through Elara’s tactile attention; the ribbon and lancing tool act as micro-settings that constrain reach and defense. Final image of “jagged edges softened by mist” directly charges the portrait’s closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy for Lila—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the second ribbon appears, but the escalation is situational coincidence rather than protagonist-driven; Elara’s agency remains observational. Cost is implied (emotional risk) yet not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy as bridge across absence emerges through the quarry portrait and ribbon motif, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final whisper of Lila’s name offers a quiet, non-literal answer. Subtext in the silhouette’s silence is effective, though the epiphany edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias; sensory selection reflects her artist priorities. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during the figure’s appearance, longer lyric stretches while sketching. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful; figurative language (“ghostly shroud,” “clockwork mechanism”) is selective and supports atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “her breath visible in the chill air” followed by “her breath steady now” creates a small paraphrase loop. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist solving a cold case via empathic art is a fresh synthesis; the quarry-as-portrait closure reconfigures the familiar missing-person trope. Specificity of the lancing tool and ribbon fragments grounds the concept. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
