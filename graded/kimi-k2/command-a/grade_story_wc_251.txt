<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is evocative but remains abstract; his “ability to hear unspoken words” is stated rather than embodied in a choice that costs him. The final beat—“pride and accomplishment”—reads as summary, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. No embodied contradiction or visible price is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise (town pausing at displays), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the final image lacks a felt forfeiture. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality break, but escalation is gentle rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cobalt library and mist are vividly sketched and return in the final image, but neither constrains a pivotal choice. The magnetic grotto is atmospherically rich yet functions more as inspirational backdrop than as an object that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is declared early but never tested under pressure; no visible price is exacted from Elias. Escalation is tonal (amplified quiet) rather than causal; the synchronized displays succeed without complication or trade-off. Agency remains inspirational rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through imagery rather than overt statement, but the final paragraph drifts toward explanatory assertion (“his humble rebellion had begun”). Subtext is strongest in the grotto passages; elsewhere the moral is lightly sketched rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a hushed cadence that matches the “amplified quiet” tone. Perceptual signature is strong: Elias notices “soft glow,” “whispers of the stars.” No dialogue appears, so voice cohesion rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, but occasional loops (“quiet contemplation,” “humble rebellion”) and elevated diction (“nurture the seeds of doubt”) edge toward template lyricism. No clarity issues; minor overwriting does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Concept of synchronized window displays as gentle insurgency is fresh, yet the execution leans on familiar motifs of misty libraries and starlit grottos. The synthesis feels thoughtful but not transformative; premise could transplant to another setting without structural loss.</comment>
