<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her longing for the lost laughter is palpable—but the “recollectionist” label remains ornamental; no occupational detail constrains her tactics. The final renunciation (accepting that paths must be rediscovered) is earned and carries felt cost, yet the contradiction between clinging and releasing is stated more than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the image of the flickering path crystallizes the new stance that loss is part of recollection. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each seed and glass glow adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode’s iridescent walls and the crater glass supply both atmosphere and constraint: the glass literally reconfigures under emotional pressure, guiding Lira’s tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the cave never becomes mere postcard scenery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the grandmother’s path—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each failed grasp intensifies the emotional cost until the final acceptance. Agency is present but soft; the tightening is more cadence than choice, yet the price (perpetual re-finding) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as migratory, beauty in re-discovery. The final image of the flickering path offers a non-literal answer to “why paths disappear” without moralizing. Subtext is carried by the seeds and glass rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“cheerful gloom,” “sea-foam recollectionist”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping occurs. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft phrases (“cheerful gloom,” “comforting darkness”) flirt with oxymoron but remain within pattern. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “recollectionist who transliterates emotions” premise is fresh, and the use of seeds as mnemonic keys is non-obvious. While the cave-of-memory trope is familiar, the integration of glass, seeds, and migratory imagery feels specific to this voice.</comment>
