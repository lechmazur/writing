<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; his “serene” label is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. The pivot from dismantling to rebuilding narratives is declared rather than dramatized, so the cost feels intellectual, not visceral. No secondary character pressure is on the page, so relationships-as-crucible is moot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias resolves to “rebuild” with puppets; cost is implied but not felt on the page. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of reflection → idea → new plan. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One transition (dawn) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is evoked with spare, tactile detail—“cracked windows,” “warped planks”—and its vast silence mirrors Elias’s inner space. The campfire stick functions as micro-setting, constraining his tactile reflection. Sensory selection is biased to Elias’s calm attention. No physics or spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Elias’s storytelling ethics have crossed into manipulation. Pressure tightens once when he questions his purpose, but the escalation is reflective, not external. Agency is present in the decision to reverse method, yet the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized. Coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of ethical storytelling emerges organically through Elias’s self-interrogation and the stick’s silent witness. Subtext resides in the shift from “meteor hush” to quiet rebuilding. Final image of dawn carries understated resonance. No moralizing summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, measured, and consistent with Elias’s urbane persona; diction favors quiet precision (“half-lit epiphanies,” “meteor hush”). No dialogue on page, so no register clash. Free-indirect texture is clean; perceptual signature is selective and calm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and no scaffold loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conduit for half-lit epiphanies”) borders on poetic excess but stays within character voice. No mixed metaphors or simultaneity errors. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Reversal of puppet-show purpose from subversion to reconciliation is a fresh angle on ethical art. Specificity of the radar dome and campfire stick grounds the concept. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
