<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the decisive shift from “orderly seed sorter” to “guardian of forgotten truths” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost of this transformation is named rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with the moonstone speck charging the final image—but the causal linkage between the speck’s glow and her irrevocable commitment is slightly under-cooked, muting the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is evoked with selective, atmospheric detail; the moonstone speck itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains choice, though the broader geography remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ prophecy—tightens once when the speck chooses Elara; the pressure is coherent but the visible price (what she forfeits or risks) is only implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s shift in vocation; the final image of her “ready to carry the message” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a consistent perceptual signature; the prose modulates rhythm under pressure, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Lines are clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional poetic layering is purposeful, with no loops or scaffold in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The moonstone-as-key premise is familiar, yet the integration with seed-sorting and arboreal prophecy feels fresh; the synthesis is specific enough to avoid cliché.</comment>
