<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the wilt of gilded leaves under deceit—but the final choice to inscribe truth feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (wilting) but not the full crucible that forces her hand. The contradiction between her reverence for candor and the city’s compromise is embodied, yet the moment she commits to restoration arrives more as thematic necessity than earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trickle of water reweights the premise that truth can revive the oasis. Causal linkage holds—map fragment → chamber → betrayal → inscription—though the “because” between hearing betrayal and deciding to etch truth could be sharper. Orientation is swift; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse domes, toxic sky, and damp undercity are rendered in selective, POV-filtered strokes that guide choice (the route etched on the plate). The zinc fragment itself becomes micro-setting, humming with memory. One step short of 8.5 because the final image (studio window) doesn’t hinge on a specific environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost conversations to restore the oasis—is signaled early and tightened when Elara hears the lovers’ betrayal. The deepening (oasis was sacrificed) narrows her moral choice, and the cost (gilded leaves wilt) is visible. Agency drives the final inscription, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of candor as ecological and moral lifeline emerges organically from the wilt/glow mechanic and the lovers’ unfiltered words. No moralizing; the final trickle of water offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the betrayal—protection vs. truth—lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tactile diction (“zinc-etched,” “gilded-leaf”) and rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Occasional elevated phrasing (“weight of silence pressing”) edges toward register drift but stays within character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (“gilded leaves curling and browning”). One mixed moment—“toxic sky glowed an eerie orange”—leans cliché, but it doesn’t touch closure. High information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The candor-wilt mechanic and postal-plate-as-memory device feel fresh, synthesizing eco-fantasy with epistolary archaeology. The lovers’ betrayal subverts the expected “lost Eden” trope. Specificity of Verdania’s glass domes and recycled air grounds the concept; risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
