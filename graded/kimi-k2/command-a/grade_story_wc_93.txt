<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his yearning for pattern and fear of the curse is dramatized in the moment he scatters the dust. The final smile and steady steps show earned change with visible cost. One notch off 9+ because the “ancient voice” remains off-stage exposition rather than a dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pattern is grasped, the path forward is foreclosed by the new unreadable sequence. Causal lens holds—each rock placement tightens options until the final reweighting. Cost is legible in the inert dust and the unreadable new pattern that restarts the quest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and painted rocks function as micro-setting that constrains Kael’s ritual and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the glow of the dust mingling with the aurora is the culminating environmental beat that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding the sacred patterns—is signaled early and tightened through each rock placement. The final leap of eels and the new unreadable sequence crystallize the cost: knowledge gained only reveals deeper mystery. One tightening is sufficient and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of universal interconnectedness emerges organically from the eels’ choreography and the reconfigured rock sequence. No moralizing; the final image of the shifted pattern offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior beats. Resonance lingers without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—Kael notices color, shape, and mathematical rhythm in character-specific ways. Compression and patterned elision are taught early (“borrowed dawn”) and paid off in the final fade. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the dust scatter, longer breaths at dawn. One hairline slip: “world seemed to hold its breath” is a minor cliché, not enough to mar closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The eel-herder who reads futures in eel choreography is a fresh synthesis; the mathematical rock ritual feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test: swapping any element breaks the whole. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
