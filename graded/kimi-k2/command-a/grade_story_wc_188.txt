<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is clear and embodied through ritual action, but interiority stays at a single register; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure. The final “Tonight, we rise” lands as declaration rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mosaic + flame tableau crystallizes hope with undeniable conceptual cost—the fortress is changed, Lira departs. Causal chain is light but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; one deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fortress, dusk, and rag knot are vivid and selective; the mosaic fountain constrains the final gesture, charging the image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened once via communal ignition. Cost is felt in the communal risk of renewed disappointment, but the price is more diffuse than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reigniting hope emerges organically from flame and mosaic; final tableau offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the rag knot’s frayed promise deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific; patterned elision (“chants…patterns, rhythms”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense; occasional stacked modifiers (“shimmered faintly in the fading light”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks ritual + communal mosaic; transformation test passes—story would collapse without Lira’s specific craft. Risk is moderate, coherence intact.</comment>
