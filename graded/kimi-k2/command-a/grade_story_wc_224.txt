<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to “understand the shape of home” is emotionally legible, yet the text mostly asserts her buried-talent pain rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses that feed her decisions; the final integration feels narrated rather than suffered through embodied choice. The shift is stated rather than performed under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the language-stone mirrors fragmented self into harmonious “state of home,” a Charged Poise that reconfigures future identity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds and the bookstore reshapes as direct consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore works as atmospheric labyrinth, but only the shifting aisles momentarily constrain movement; it never fully integrates as constraint or tool in the closure image, leaving the mountain more backdrop than crucible. Sensual detail is vivid yet mostly decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Stake—the price of reclaiming buried talents—rises steadily; the thunder motif and stone glow tighten cost and foreclose escape. One decisive shift as Elara seeds thoughts that cannot be undone. Lack of external stakes caps 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Home as internal harmony” emerges organically from integration of stone–memory–feather; final reconfiguration reframes earlier images without sermonizing. Theme is coherent, yet early paragraphs spell out the intent slightly too explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lushly rhythmic free-indirect prose retains consistent lyric voice; a few filter verbs (“Elara knew,” “Elara felt”) slightly dull immediacy without breaking texture. Voice successfully modulates to wonder at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose flows with sensory compression and avoids redundancy; occasional lyrical overload (“labyrinthine corridors rearranging”) momentarily blurs cause/effect rhythm. Minor scaffolding does not obscure the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>The bookstore-mountain plus nightly reality substitution creates a singular fusion of inner and outer labyrinths; the feather-texture method feels fresh and inevitable. Premise avoids generic retrieval arcs, achieving genuine inflection.</comment>
