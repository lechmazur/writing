<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is evocative but generic; the “bridge” epiphany arrives as summary rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice under pressure shows the cost of accepting the crown—she simply “steps back into the tunnels.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crown’s activation reweights the premise from inspection to stewardship. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the felt cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Crystal caves and luminous quartz are vividly rendered and tethered to Elara’s perception. The setting’s “latent radiance” constrains visibility and guides her toward the crown, but it never materially limits her final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dissolving isolation—surfaces early. Escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; the pearl’s pull and crown’s chorus intensify mood but do not narrow options or exact an on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective hope emerges through image and action, not sermon. The crown’s reconfiguration of confessions into harmony offers a resonant non-moral answer, though the thematic weight leans on abstract “walls between hearts.”</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with sensory diction filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant hush,” “latent radiance”) edges toward the lyrical but stays legible.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic; figurative language is selective. A few near-repetitions (“resonant hush,” “heartbeat of hesitation”) and filter phrases (“she felt”) slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The bunker-inspector-turned-mystic premise is fresh, and the crystalline sanctuary avoids cliché. Yet the transformation arc feels familiar; risk is aesthetic rather than structural.</comment>
