<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven interiority is embodied in the amber stare and the tremor when she opens the letters; the final renunciation—writing as the lost child—earns its cost through prior causality. The contradictory impulse (to silence vs. to listen) is dramatized in the firmware’s shifting whispers. Minor slip: “meteor hush” is slightly performative rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the firmware’s melody turns mournful-soothing, the lab falls silent, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost. Causal chain (letters → response → firmware shift) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber, glass chambers, and humming machines are filtered through Elara’s selective perception; the amber’s glow reweights meaning at the end, constraining her choice to write. Spatial anchors are clear by 120 words. Minor over-reliance on visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when the letters force confrontation; the decisive deepening is her decision to answer as the child, which forecloses denial. Cost is visible in the lab’s meteor hush. No external reversals needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and listening emerges organically from the amber, firmware, and letters; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the amber’s glow and the firmware’s softened whispers carries the resonance. Avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—“meteor hush,” “folding of time.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“constellation tattooist”) risks register drift but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“hush the dissonance of old guilt” echoed) and one mixed metaphor (“roar that only she could hear” vs. “whispers”) keep it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cyber-magic grief therapy via star-tattoo semaphore; the haunted firmware and amber insect feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the meteor hush. No derivative echoes.</comment>
