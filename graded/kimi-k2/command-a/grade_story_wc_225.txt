<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and need for self-forgiveness are embodied in her tactile chess piece and the tapestry decoding; the final “quiet resolve” lands as earned stasis. Interiority is specific, but the parallel to the king/pawn parable is delivered as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s message reframes forgiveness as ongoing journey, with the chess piece now a talisman of that stance. Causal chain holds—tapestry insight → labyrinth entry → thread pull → reconfiguration—though the king parable arrives late and externally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry border are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s stasis. The chess piece functions as micro-setting; its final reweighting as talisman justifies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the tapestry forces Elara to confront her own “frayed soul.” The labyrinth walk is the single meaningful escalation; cost is conceptual (guilt lifted) rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness-as-process emerges organically from the tapestry story and labyrinth message. Subtext is strongest in the silent handling of the chess piece; the king parable edges toward overt allegory but is saved by its placement before the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“woven hush,” “fierce repose”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent; no dialogue to test distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“winnow the soul”) slightly strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor loop: “her fidgeting now purposeful” echoes earlier “fingers fidgeted productively.” No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Chess tutor + labyrinth + tapestry is a fresh synthesis; the forgiveness arc avoids tidy moralizing. The king parable risks cliché but is grounded in Elara’s specific guilt. Risk-taking is moderate; no structural experimentation beyond lyric compression.</comment>
