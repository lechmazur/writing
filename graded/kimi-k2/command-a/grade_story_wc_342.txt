<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and artistry are foregrounded, but her dramatic need—containing infinity—is relayed more by exposition than embodied stakes. Interiority vivid but could sharpen contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands: sky mirrored inside the book safe, paid for by imminent collapse. Causal linkage holds under an accumulative-textural lens; quiet final poise reconfigures the infinite within the finite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Oak-trunk library expertly anchored; fractal carving details accumulate pressure. Micro-setting pressure visible (“shine of constellation grooves”) narrowly constraining touch and tempo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes—“mirror sky before building falls”—are clear but escalate mostly through announced doom. Progressive constraints (decoding coin, tremor walls) tighten options once credibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of capturing infinity within limits emerges organically from craft quest. Quiet, non-moral ending recalibrates ambition to finite acceptance with resonant visual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual voice—“every vein in a leaf” voice—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; compression accepts subtle ellipsis when payoff lands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is precise and fluid; occasional heightened devices are purposeful. Scaffolding minimal, though a few near-duplicate sentences slow blade-sharp escalation by a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic quest with face-blind artist remains vivid; specific coin-device and tree-lock raise stakes uniquely. Singular edge slightly blunted by familiar ticking-building motif.</comment>
