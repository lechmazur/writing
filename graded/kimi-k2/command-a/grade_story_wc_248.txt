<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior states remain largely summary-level ("analytically intuitive" told, not shown); no live contradictory impulse on the page. Endurance costs are merely implied—no concrete forfeiture visible—and thus the final shift feels foreordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Smooth cause-and-and linkage moves from portrait to mural to scroll, but the promised act of actually taking—burning, saving, or delivering—never materializes. Closure is an epiphany rather than a decisive, costed reconfiguration; the promise is "rescued" via interpretation, removing physical jeopardy and the stakes leak away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Archive is atmospherically sketched yet generic; lack of specific obstacle or resource from the setting keeps environment from constraining choices. Key sensory touches arrive but dissipate; setting never becomes a tool or adversary.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to rescue a forgotten promise”—stays lyrical and intangible; no visible price or narrowing of alternatives is dramatized in scene. Tension relies on atmospheric pacing rather than a felt risk of loss, keeping the pressure soft.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of devotion and preservation emerges through accumulation of images rather than dramatized dilemma; late scroll reading offers intellectual resonance but scant moral cost. Final takeaway is touching yet abstract, lacking the visceral charge needed for 7+.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Omniscient lens remains elegant and consistent; vocabulary and cadence reflect a scholarly intensity that never slips. No head-hopping; micro-POV lapses are absent.</comment>

<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally crisp yet repetitive beats (“moved with purpose,” “paused,” “stepped back”) create mild momentum drag. A few stacked modifiers (“volcanic tenderness,” “driven by a singular motivation”) verge on theme-label without embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Re-framing an arsonist as gentle archaeologist is fresh, but relies on well-worn “lost-civilization scroll” and “promise behind the art” tropes. Risky inversion lands mild because no actual fire or social consequence complicates the conceit.</comment>
