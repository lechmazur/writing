<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael’s frugality and irony are stated but never embodied in a costly choice; the final covenant feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal struggle. Interiority remains generic (“profound sense of purpose”) rather than concrete and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The closure image—Kael lifting the tile toward the stars—offers a Charged Poise, but the causality chain is thin: the schematic on the floor instantly reveals the compartment, then the tile instantly reveals the covenant. No intermediate tightening or cost is dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reimagined palace is evoked with selective sensory detail (marble floor etchings, observatory dome) that filters through Kael’s astronomical gaze. Yet the space never physically constrains or endangers him; it remains backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (“seal a covenant with the unknown”) are declared early but never tested or escalated; the tile’s discovery resolves the quest without forcing a trade-off or visible loss. Pressure stays flat under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Encrypted devotion surfaces as an abstract motif rather than an emergent theme; the tile’s message is paraphrased rather than dramatized, so the thematic weight rests on assertion. The ending gestures toward resonance but lacks the concrete image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly archaic cadence that suits the setting. Occasional elevated diction (“dusky harmony,” “celestial forces”) edges toward the purple but remains controlled and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, but repetitive phrasing (“magic square tile,” “encrypted devotion”) and mild scaffold (“he began to uncloak… he realized…”) dull momentum. No line-level artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Babylonian astronomy with a ciphered covenant is fresh in concept, yet the execution leans on familiar quest beats. Specificity of the tile’s symbols and their astronomical linkage offers a memorable inflection, but the overall arc remains recognizable.</comment>
