<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete; embodied stress in hand-scars and crystallizing quill work. Motivation “transform scars into stories” anchors stakes. Only micro-choice of breathing through superstition lacks enactment cost, capping 9-entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single scene holds Accumulative/Textural lens: rising sensory density, micro-cadence of breath/storm → crystallization → recede → smooth quill. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: quill restored signals stance shift; felt cost is continued life with known fear, not vanquished.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock and mist provide literal edge-of-world stakes; quill and tea steamed mist become tactile micro-versions. Weather and platform sway guide choice (“platform swayed gently, as if in sync with her thoughts”). Cost not compressed into final object use prevents 9+ cap.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery over old fear—ties pressure to quill’s response. One tightening beat when first drop hits and tip frosts; loss of smooth tool raises cost. Escalation ends with silence—endurance confirms agency and forecloses regress path.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Scars into stories” emerges organically from quill-crystallization reversal; no explicit moralizing. Final paragraph’s cleansed world offers conceptual repricing—scars ≡ chapters, fear neither hero nor enemy. Theme complexity preserved without resolution porn.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person focalization filters every detail through Elara’s sensory fear: “fingers trembled,” “breath she now held.” Cadence slows under assumed ritual calm, tightens during crystallization. Minimal dialogue fits single-POV design; no head-hopping.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, varied rhythms, sensory detail packed in single paragraph moves (steam curls, obsidian glint). Metaphors tight: “crystallizing like frost” ties directly to quill’s material state. No loops or purple; final image “clean world cleansed” is taut.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Superstition-as-ritual refreshes familiar “facing inner storm” shape into textured, folkloric specificity. Crystallizing stress-quill feels organic invention. Risk: poetic quiet ending over spectacle pays off in charged poise rather than reversal.</question>
