<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“fingers tracing the cold, metallic surface”) and her motive is clear, but the shift from curiosity to cosmic guardian feels asserted rather than earned; the woman’s exposition short-circuits internal struggle. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene before the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the orb reweights her identity and duty with visible cost (“weight of her responsibility”). Causal linkage is present—shard → transport → revelation—but the woman’s speech is a bald info-dump that softens the tightening. Lens holds as Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s rust-and-grease texture and the alien forest’s “symphony of whispers” are sharply filtered through Elara’s sensory vocation. The merged orb at the end recharges the bay as living nexus, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking is clean across the single transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the weight of a withheld truth”—is signaled early and escalates when the woman warns “heavier than you imagine.” Yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; no concrete forfeiture is dramatized on the page, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of guardianship across realities emerges organically from Elara’s mapping gift and the orb’s vision; no moralizing speech intrudes. The final image of her stepping forward with “purpose” offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise (“cyclically spontaneous,” “murmur of half-remembered dreams”), consistent with a sensory cartographer’s perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“withheld truth,” “multiverse”) fits the speculative register. One mixed metaphor—“air thickening like a curtain being drawn”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The sensory-map-maker-as-interdimensional-guardian angle feels fresh, synthesizing familiar portal tropes through Elara’s vocation. The cyclical shard and orb payoff are specific to this voice. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
