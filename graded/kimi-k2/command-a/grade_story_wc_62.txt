<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Intricate, embodied interiority anchors Elara; her chisel-in-hand micro-choice (“began to retrace”) pivots from paralysis to carving. The contradiction—grief as space not shape—earns her final stance. No dialogue with on-page character, so relationship crucible n/a; spectral mentor pressure felt solely via memory. Ghost guidance works as abstract constraint rather than active, embodied stakes; slight motivational opacity in closing beats where Tomas simply “fades.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara finds the shape of grief through creation itself, reconfiguring her remaining options (carve the journey, carry the loss) with discernible cost—spectral Tomas departs, mentorship complete. Causal line: mentor memory → insight “grief in movement” → ribbon pattern → marble etching is tight. Orientation anchored early; temporal span “butterfly migration” stays legible. Meets Publishable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>“Ancient greenhouse at dusk” is selective and atmospheric; glass-pane hum, dusk-filtered light and fern density frame Elara’s isolation and quiet reverberation. Butterflies and ribbon function as micro-settings charging the final image, constraining her carving vision. Enough constraint to clear 7-band without ascending into the indelible 8+ territory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grasping collective grief’s shape—signaled early. Escalation hinges on a single, interior tightening: from static impossibility to dynamic migration insight. Cost feels abstract—Tomas’s departing presence—and not viscerally enacted on the page. Escalation is present but not piercing enough for the 8+ bracket.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme emerges organically through ribbon-as-migration, not thesis. Grief’s “migration through time and memory” reweights premise without preach. Ending’s “creation itself” as the only possible shape offers resonant, non-moral answer. Lyrical subtlety; avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Distinct contemplative lyric voice—compressed yet sensuous—holds POV tightly. Controlled rhythm, selective metaphor, no head-hopping. Filter-verbs minimal. Dialogue absent, so voice distinction in speaker terms not evaluated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Poise and polish evident; mild poetic abstraction (“thundering calm,” “fleeting symphony”) edges into overwriting but reads purposeful under lyric lens. Some near-stock phrases but overall propulsion intact. No line artifacts cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Fresh premise combining spectral mentorship with masonry grief-work is particularized by ribbon-as-butterfly motif. Resist familiar graveyard tropes; risk resides in quiet lyricism, not obvious hook.</comment>
