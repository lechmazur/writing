<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“their breath mingling with the salt-laden air”), but the wanderer’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; no micro-choice under pressure visibly forecloses a path with cost. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of salvaged fragments tightens toward the archive discovery, then reweights via the letter. Closure is a Charged Poise—guardianship stance crystallizes with felt conceptual cost (“voice for the silenced”). Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Port container maze is vivid, selective, and causally active—mudflats reveal relics, tides dictate rhythm, archive container constrains discovery. Final moonlit image recharges earlier shadows, locking setting to theme. Micro-setting (label, letter) functions as charged objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim erased histories—signaled early. Pressure deepens via archive find; letter tightens emotional cost. No reversal, but meaningful intensification under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (burden of guardianship) rather than tangible, yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges organically from salvage motif; “texture of memories” is dramatized through tactile fragments. Final image offers resonant non-moral answer: remembering itself is the texture. Avoids overt thesis, though “guardian of the forgotten” edges close to label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually specific (“rust speak,” “salt-laden air”). No dialogue; free-indirect texture sustains POV. Rhythm modulates with tidal cadence. Occasional elevated diction (“repository of erased histories”) slightly drifts from nameless wanderer’s likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor scaffold (“they moved… they sifted… they realized”) and one mixed metaphor (“symphony of lives intertwined”) but no loops in peak beats. High information density; final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of bureaucratic death-error survivor salvaging erased lives feels fresh; synthesis of port archaeology and systemic erasure is specific. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure image. No derivative echoes; transformation test passes.</comment>
