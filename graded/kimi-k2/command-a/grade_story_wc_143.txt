<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the hourglass grain anchors her grief and choice. The mentor’s posthumous message supplies a clear motive, but the final endurance (“outlast the dawn”) is more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulse, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she stays to finish the documentation, accepting the risk of being late. The causal chain (mentor’s timed message → her decision to remain) is coherent under a Causal lens, and the cost—possible confrontation with terraforming crews—is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is rendered with selective sensory detail; the regolith crunch, visor fog, and slanted shadows all serve the hush. The setting constrains her pace and frames the hourglass grain’s final gleam, charging the last photograph with loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the site before terraforming—tightens once when the timed message forces her to choose between safety and legacy. The pressure is coherent, but the escalation is single-note; no new complication arises after the message is read.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence versus duty emerges through concrete particulars: footprints, metal dulled by decades, sand grain. The final image of the module in dawnlight reweights the premise without moralizing, letting silence carry the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, lunar, and slightly elegiac; diction stays within a trained inspector’s lexicon. Occasional poetic lift (“dawning hush”) is earned by context and never breaks POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or mixed metaphors. A few stock phrases (“weight of her task,” “heart quickened”) dull the edge slightly, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The Apollo-site elegy is familiar, but the timed chemical message and hourglass grain give it fresh specificity. The synthesis feels inevitable yet not radically novel; risk is present but moderate.</comment>
