<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“copperlight repose… felt cost”) and motivation stays rooted, but Elias’s final shift from guilt to defiant truth-teller reads asserted more than embodied at cliff-edge intensity—micro-choice lacks visible last-minute friction, muting earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure beats hit the lattice-light repricing (before/after of guilt vs. truth) with tangible cost on the page; causal arc stays tight under Accumulative lens, though motivation for final ascension could carry one more concrete beat of pressure to cross the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse chamber, ore-veined walls and jagged reef function as active pressure—copperlight constrains his choice, reef offers fatal drop—but spatial choreography around the spiral stair and final exterior hover could be a hair cleaner to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free truth vs. vanishing bodies) is coherent and tightens neatly; “bodies as offerings” reversal narrows choice at climax, cost is on-page. One additional tangible consequence of choosing truth over silence would lock 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (“truth as redemption of inherited lies”) emerges organically from lore-tied stakes rather than statement; final dawn image reweights earlier wolf-fable shame with cost felt. Minor thematic echo at close stays earned, not moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—salt-stung, baroque-yet-restrained imagery—and POV holds firm; subtle compression (“hover near”) reads intentional. Cadence lags once in mid-descent during father-journal beat; tightening a clause would secure +0.2.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and urgent; metaphors land clean. A single filter-clump (“bodies—three guards, vanished without a trace”) and one near-repetition of “lattice” within four lines create slight drag. No artifacts touch ending line, keeping 8 band open.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Inherit-wolf trope twisted into legacy-driven silence quest feels non-obvious, scaffolded through copper-lit lattice myth. One too-familiar lighthouse prison image keeps score just shy of 8+ gate for truly startling freshness.</comment>
