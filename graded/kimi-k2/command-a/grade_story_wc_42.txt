<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “luminous ache” and tactile precision anchor her—but the leap from “clock hand = escape velocity” to dismantling time itself is asserted more than dramatized; the final renunciation is felt yet slightly under-motivated by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the new device reweights time’s flow with visible cost (“warm glow of fulfillment”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of stillness → spinning → deliberate rhythm tightens stakes once. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s thin air and stone floor constrain posture and tool use; the clock itself becomes micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, though “lunar” remains ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral without freezing it—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: dismantling the clock forecloses repair and risks total loss. Cost is conceptual (surrender to flow) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of embracing impermanence emerges through concrete action; the final image of “sound of a leaf falling” reweights earlier chaos into harmony without moralizing. Subtext is carried by gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent (“precision of someone who had spent decades mending…moments”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the slowed clock rhythm. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold in “relentless spinning…relentless motion” but does not stall momentum. Final cadence shift is earned and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses horology with orbital mechanics in a fresh way; transformation test passes—story would collapse without the clock-as-escape-velocity conceit. Risk is moderate; not ground-breaking but specific and integrated.</comment>
