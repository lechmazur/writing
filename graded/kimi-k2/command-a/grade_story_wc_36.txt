<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven guilt underpins the quest, but her interiority slips into summarised regret rather than present-tense contradiction. The moment she lifts the flute her trembling hands externalise cost, yet earlier beats rely on exposition not micro-choice. Enough individuation to feel singular, though perfectionism reads as authorial varnish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands: the decisive note dissolves worlds with conceptual cost. Earlier driftwood markers signal causal breadcrumbs under an accumulative lens, but two beats resolve via happenstance rather than because/therefore linkage—minor slippage in the final corridor. Orientation clear by p3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is more postcard than pressure; canyon walls serve mood more than access or resource. Micro-setting narrowing funnel late raises stakes, earning edge, yet driftwood markers hold greater tactical power. Sensory selections skew visual, missing tactility of relic-handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prevent history repeating”—ratchets with each retrieved marker. One meaningful tightening: the humming flute narrows options to play or flee. Cost legible on page; escalation coherent under situational lens despite convenient rift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of learning through failure threads consistently; flute music as counter-spell to hubris reweights the premise effectively. Ending image of shimmering bridge avoids tidy moral, leaning on untested hope. Subtext present in Ella pausing before playing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature registers canyon acoustics. Prose is lyrical yet clear: “canyon hush…alive.” Avoids over-tidy rationalisation—fear of recurrence filters through hesitations not labels. Clean mechanics and distinctive rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Density high with propulsive cadence—“walls blurring as reality itself unraveled.” Slack appears in retrospective grief rumination; one looped synonym string on “failure” incurs minor drag. Overall read-aloud ear test passes; zero major figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Grief driving quest is not new; combining with musical inter-dimensional travel offers mild fresh inflection. Risk taken in silent-canyon climax is restrained yet coherent. Transformation arrives via non-obvious harmonics rather than histrionics, sustaining originality.</comment>
