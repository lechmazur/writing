<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid (“chaotically precise” embodied in her tactile handling of shards), but the shift from archeologist-of-dreams to memory-bridge-builder is asserted more than dramatized; the final vow lands as sentiment rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: broken mirror → modification → portal vision → vow. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost (“no matter the cost”), but the price remains abstract; lens is stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Moonlit canyon and mirror shards are textured and purposeful; the mirror’s evolving state constrains every beat and charges the final image. Spatial anchors are clear, sensory selection biased to Elara’s engineer gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—resurrect abandoned dreams via memory entanglement—tightens once when the mirror becomes portal. Agency drives escalation, but the cost is more declared than felt; still, the choice forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of salvaging human ambition emerges through concrete action (mirror modification) rather than statement. Final image of “stars closer now” offers non-literal resonance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, textured, and reflective of Elara’s engineer precision. No dialogue, but perceptual signature is sharp; occasional lyric lift (“quaking reverie”) is earned and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense. Minor scaffold (“shadows danced like ancient spirits”) is acceptable; no loops or register drift. Final paragraph cadence crystallizes stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Memory-imprinting mirror as archaeological tool is a fresh synthesis; trope of abandoned space dreams is revitalized through synaptic-plasticity conceit. Specificity prevents generic feel, though concept edges familiar lyric territory.</comment>
