<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and grief are embodied in tactile micro-choices (clutching the card, kneeling among threads), but the interior contradiction between finding Lyra and finding herself is asserted more than dramatized. The final step through the door feels earned by the weaving of others’ memories, yet the cost—dissolution of the card—reads symbolic rather than personally wounding. Secondary pressure from the ship’s ghosts is atmospheric, not interpersonal, so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact-diary thickens pattern until the mist-door crystallizes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara accepts unkindled solace and crosses—whose cost is the card’s loss and the implicit forfeiture of any return. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. A slightly tighter causal hinge between reading the threads and the door’s appearance would push higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The ship’s rusted hull, shattered mirrors, and salt-stink fog are selective and POV-filtered; they guide Elara’s path and echo her corrosion. The emerald card’s glow against decay supplies a micro-setting constraint that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather thickens atmosphere without clutter. One more tactile interaction with a decayed prop mid-journey would cinch 9-band.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach the garden—tightens once: the threads must be read before the door appears. Agency is Elara’s choice to weave stories; the cost is time and the card itself. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks a second, sharper pinch; coincidence does not resolve. The escalation suffices for this length but feels single-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing flawed memory emerges organically from Elara’s act of weaving strangers’ lives into her own. The garden’s non-literal answer—freedom through acceptance—lands without moralizing. Subtext in the card’s dissolution quietly reframes earlier loss. One late line of overt thesis (“freedom was not about escaping…”) slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“hazy embrace… groaning under the weight of forgotten dreams”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices decay, color, and ghost-echoes in character-specific ways. No POV drift. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. One or two ornate phrases edge toward purple but remain within tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences carry double duty. Occasional stacked modifiers (“haunting melody of what once was”) flirt with excess but do not stall momentum. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. A single paraphrase loop (“memories and identities were said to bloom like flowers” echoed later) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing carnival-ship gothic with a memory-garden quest feels fresh; the emerald card as key to collective remembrance is non-obvious. Tropes are transformed through sensory specificity rather than ornament. The quiet renunciation ending avoids spectacle gimmickry. A touch more idiosyncratic detail in the ship’s former acts would push higher.</comment>
