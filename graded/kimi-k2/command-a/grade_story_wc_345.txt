<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism is stated, but her interiority is thin; Kael’s shift from stranger to caretaker is sketched rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page, and the “felt cost” of the restoration is diffuse. Relationships among the four allies remain generic placeholders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with the bell’s ring and nebula’s return—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the garden and the planet. Causality is causal-lite: because they fix the bell, the nebula revives; the link is legible but not deeply pressured. No orientation debt; the drive lens (Causal) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and orchard air are vividly evoked, but they serve as backdrop rather than constraint. The butterfly garden itself is tactile and specific, and the bell’s bronze wings charge the final image. Setting never narrows choices, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—restore the nebula—but pressure escalates only through cooperative montage rather than narrowing options. The decisive act (striking the bell) is low-friction; the cost is communal joy rather than personal loss. Agency is collective, diluting individual jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically from the plot, avoiding overt moralizing. The nebula’s return offers a resonant image of shared renewal, but subtext remains gentle rather than charged. No late thematic exposition; ambiguity is modest but present.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient voice is consistent and lyrical, with rhythmic cadence suited to fable. Perceptual signature is diffuse across the ensemble; no single POV dominates. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, with only minor loops (“bloom/blooming” echo). Sentence variety supports momentum; metaphors are coherent. A few ornamental phrases (“brambled hope”) flirt with excess but do not stall the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Combines pastoral SF with ghost-led quest in a fresh but gentle synthesis. The nebula-as-healing-energy and chalked sidewalk messages feel novel yet inevitable. Risk is modest; transformation is communal rather than subversive.</comment>
