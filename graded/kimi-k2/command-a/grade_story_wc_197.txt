<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and embodied—her fingers tracing the key, the tremble as she lifts the ledger—but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “tyranny of indifference” rhetoric. The final vanishing is earned, yet the contradictory impulses (fear vs defiance) are asserted more than dramatized in the moment she transmits the data.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (wading, unlocking, transmitting) tightens options until the broadcast forecloses capture. Closure is a decisive change—Mara’s disappearance after mass transmission—with the cost of permanent exile legible in “ghost in their machine.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon’s shifting colors and submerged door anchor space early; the starlit water constrains stealth and hides the keyhole, directly shaping tactics. Micro-setting—the algae-encrusted lock—charges the final image as Mara slips away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ignite resistance before capture—escalates as footsteps close in; the transmission is a clear tightening that trades safety for impact. Cost is felt: she loses the archive refuge and any future public identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs erasure emerges through the ledger’s dust and the broadcast’s light; no explicit moralizing. The lagoon’s shimmer reframed as “promise of what was to come” offers resonant reconfiguration without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail—“boots sinking slightly,” “water cooling her nerves.” Occasional elevated phrasing (“coded freedom etched into brass”) edges toward register drift but stays within POV’s awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; minor loops (“the key in her pocket felt heavy…reminder of the stakes”) and stacked modifiers (“hues of emerald and gold, as if…”) slightly dilute density. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar rebellion tropes are refreshed by the puddle-reflection map and the defunct phone-company relic; the archive-as-weapon twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the lagoon’s starlit keyhole anchors the premise.</comment>
