<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire for “texture of connection” is declared but never embodied in a concrete, costly choice; her interiority drifts into thematic summary (“she questioned her assumptions”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The carbide-lens experiment is observation, not crucible—no visible trade-off or mistake. Ending renunciation is asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft CR (re-weighting progress via lens image) but the causal chain is loose: the lens refracts sounds, Elara “feels” enlightenment, but no decisive act or irreversible cost seals the pilgrimage. Mosaic shards (lab, past recordings) are legible, yet transitions float free of tightening pressure. Orientation is clear, but lens ambiguity persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>“Laboratory of lost sounds” and carbide lamp are vividly sketched, but the lab never physically constrains choices; the lens gains symbolic heft yet lacks tactile handling in the climax. Sensory selection is evocative—golden shadows, whispers—though micro-setting (body, tool) doesn’t shape the final tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering human connection through sound—is declared early, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; each refracted sound deepens theme yet narrows no live option. No visible price is paid on the page; the pilgrimage ends in affirmation without forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of progress versus lost connection emerges organically from refracted sounds, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the factory hum’s despair beneath prosperity. Final image of the lens as “balance” offers quiet CR, though resonance is blunted by lack of embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance; diction is controlled, rhythm modulates with emotional swell. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated phrasing (“propel the world forward”) edges toward editorial commentary, slightly thinning POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but suffers mild loop drift—“sound,” “connection,” “progress” repeat without new pressure. Metaphors remain coherent; no syntactic monotony. A few filter phrases (“she realized,” “she wondered”) dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Concept of an “artificial pilgrimage” through obsolete sounds is fresh, and the carbide-lens-as-prism twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Familiar binaries (industrial hope vs. despair) are refreshed through sonic archaeology. Risk-taking is moderate; execution stays safe rather than bold.</comment>
