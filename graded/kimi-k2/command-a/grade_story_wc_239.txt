<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The witness is sketched more as archetype than person; interiority is abstract (“felt the weight of their task”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, and the final epiphany arrives without visible cost to the self. Motivation is stated, not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary merges with the mural, reweighting the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and hush deepen until the final resonance. One transition (chamber to chamber) is legible; orientation holds. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The temple is evoked with selective sensory detail (dust, shifting walls, mural pulse) that guides movement and mood. The dictionary itself becomes micro-setting, constraining the witness’s choices. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Final image recharges the mural and the hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unify the frayed threads of existence”—is declared early but remains abstract; pressure tightens only via mystical atmosphere rather than concrete obstacles. No visible price is exacted on the page. Escalation is tonal, not tactical; options do not visibly narrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of unity-through-unraveling emerges through image (spiral mural, glowing dictionary) rather than statement. Subtext is present in the hush and the witness’s wordless communion with the temple. Final reconfiguration avoids moralizing. Some residual abstraction keeps it from higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and matched to the witness’s contemplative stance. Syntax modulates with the resounding hush; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts toward the oracular (“cosmic illusions”) but stays within the established register. Distinct perceptual signature maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated phrasing (“universe’s hiccup”) is purposeful and taught early. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of spiral arbitration, dictionary-as-key, and temple-as-living-archive feels fresh and inevitable. Familiar tropes (ancient library, cosmic witness) are transformed through specific imagery and the Accumulative closure. Risk in lyric abstraction is controlled and pays off.</comment>
