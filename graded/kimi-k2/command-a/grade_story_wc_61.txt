<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—"weight of generations in her soul"—but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the gear’s glow responds to her, yet no embodied micro-choice reveals how the shift costs her. The final “radiant glow” lands as earned stasis, but the absence of a visible personal price keeps it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s light now “embraces” rather than burns, and the gear’s integration reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light increases until it crystallizes—but the causal bridge from “sonar pinging” to “conduit” is asserted rather than dramatized, blunting the 9-gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden is rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail—“colors swirled like whispers”—and the bioluminescent blooms literally constrain her method by offering a non-fire light source. Spatial coherence is clean; the gear’s metallic surface and the falling petals track consistently to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and escalates through the gear’s intensifying glow. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gear becomes conduit, foreclosing the fire path. The cost is conceptual (she accepts endless responsibility) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: light as memory, fire as consumption. The final image of “radiant glow that did not burn” reweights the premise without moralizing. Yet the generational-patterns motif is more asserted than embodied, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled—“quiet sigh of falling petals,” “liquid silver”—with rhythmic variation that modulates under pressure. POV remains stable; no filter-verb clutter. The nebula garden’s sensory signature feels specific to Elara’s sentimentalist lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with strong verbs—“spilling into the air like liquid silver”—and no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) edges outside the POV’s lexicon but does not obscure clarity. Density is high; every sentence advances image or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of steampunk gear with nebula botanics feels fresh; the “infinity-approximating design” is not mere ornament but becomes the literal bridge between memory and light. Risk is moderate—lyric abstraction could have collapsed—but coherence holds.</comment>
