<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara’s motivation is stated early and reinforced, but interiority stays generic (“heart quickening,” “resolve firm”) and no contradictory impulse is dramatized; the final stance is asserted rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clean; orientation is swift. Closure is a Charged Poise (notebook filled, room now “threshold”) with conceptual cost, but the pirate broadcast’s arrival feels coincidental rather than causally triggered by Clara’s actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>“Ember alcove in mist” is vivid and atmospheric; the shortwave’s glow becomes a micro-setting that constrains attention and charges the final image. Spatial anchors hold; sensory selection favors urgency without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost stories—is clear. Pressure tightens when the song appears, but escalation is driven by external transmission rather than Clara’s choices; no visible price is paid or option foreclosed on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-art emerges implicitly from Clara’s labor and the song’s arrival. Final image of the room as “threshold” offers quiet resonance, but subtext is thin; no counter-reading complicates the hope.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays consistent; perceptual signature is lightly etched (“quill hovering,” “faint luminescence”). Rhythm modulates with tension; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and mostly precise; occasional soft filler (“something felt different,” “seemed to know”) dulls immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors; final paragraph lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise blends post-apocalyptic quiet with music transcription—fresh enough. Pirate broadcast and luminous dial are specific inflections, yet the plot beats follow familiar “mysterious signal” contours without deeper twist.</comment>
