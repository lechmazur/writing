<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured—hands stained with indigo, the magnetic tug of others’ stories—but the “second-chance” heart remains abstract, never complicating his present choice. The woman’s grief is sketched with restraint, yet her decision to share is more reported than dramatized. Micro-choice: placing the wing on the table is clear, but the cost of this illumination feels diffuse rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael steps into the mist “knowing his journey was far from over,” reconfiguring his purpose from passive observer to active illuminator. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the stake until the final image crystallizes. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt; the woman’s release is hers, not his.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating tea house is evoked with selective, atmospheric strokes—cloud-kissed plateau, groaning beams, jasmine-thick air—yet it never constrains choice; it’s backdrop rather than pressure. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting and charged object, catching light to refract meaning, but the plateau itself remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why stories magnetize and whether to share them—surfaces early and tightens through Kael’s encounter. The woman’s disclosure is the single pressure point, but escalation is gentle; no visible price alters Kael’s tactics. Agency is contemplative rather than decisive, fitting the Accumulative lens yet limiting urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared stories as illumination emerges organically through gesture and image, not statement. The wing’s shifting iridescence reweights from fragile beauty to shared burden, but the final exchange edges toward parable—“holding on… letting go”—slightly diluting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Kael’s synesthetic awareness. Compression and patterned elision (“sun painted trails of amber and gold”) are taught early and sustained. Dialogue is spare but natural, carrying subtext without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Occasional soft loops—“quiet conversation… quiet understanding”—are minor. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of a post-transplant empath tracking stories via butterfly wing is fresh, yet the emotional arc treads familiar grief-sharing territory. Specificity of dye-stained hands and sun-trail method lifts it above template, but risk is tempered by gentle stakes.</comment>
