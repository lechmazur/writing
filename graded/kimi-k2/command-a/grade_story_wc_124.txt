<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s aromatic caution and bottled grief are embodied in micro-choices (refusing strong scents, finally uncorking the vial). Interior contradiction is present yet not fully simultaneous; the shift to acceptance feels slightly epiphanic rather than wrested under live pressure. Cost is felt—he forecloses his long avoidance—but the sister’s dialogue is more remembered than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s uncorking reweights his stance toward grief with visible cost (the shop’s shadows soften). Causal chain is intact—vial offered → resisted → used → reconfiguration. One minor ellipsis: why the woman’s urgency vanishes. Orientation is clean; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Neon-drenched shop, fogged greenhouse, and sterile hospital room are vividly selective and filtered through Elias’s scent-dreading bias. The greenhouse’s extinct blooms constrain the memory reveal; the shop’s lanterns echo the final softening. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Could use one more tactile anchor during the hospital shard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias face the memory encoded in scent?—is signaled early and tightens once when he uncorks the vial. Agency drives the final act; cost is the surrender of his aromatic shield. Pressure is coherent but single-turn; no deepening complication beyond the memory sequence itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: scent as ungovernable archive of love and loss. Subtext operates in the ultraviolet glow and the softening shadows—no moralizing. Final image of acceptance reweights earlier caution without statement. Complexity is present yet leans tender rather than thorny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensory filter; diction is consistent and slightly wistful without purple drift. Rhythm modulates with memory shifts. Dialogue is minimal but voice-apt when spoken. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is clear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional soft phrases (“flickering warmth,” “crystal shadows”) flirt with cliché but remain tethered to Elias’s POV. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. One minor simultaneity hiccup: “as the transformation completes” reads slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory-revealing perfume—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of scent-dreading lantern broker and ultraviolet vial keeps it from generic magical realism. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks. Could push further into the ethical cost of commodified memory.</comment>
