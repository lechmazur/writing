<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the grief she absorbs from the prism lands as a visceral cost. Yet her “attentive mystic” trait is asserted more than tested—no contradictory impulse complicates her stance under pressure. The final humility feels earned, but the absence of a competing desire keeps the arc from full tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s sorrow reframes Elara’s theory into lived responsibility. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the mist lifts and the air itself feels heavier. One minor drift: the frost-on-window method is named late and never integrated into the present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The quartz arbor’s refracted light and chill ground every beat; the prism’s facets literally cast the final rainbows that charge the closing image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. The arbor could have constrained movement more actively to reach the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving objects hold emotion—faces a single decisive test when grief floods in. The tightening is the moment she lifts the prism and feels the cost; options narrow from data to stewardship. Pressure is coherent but stops short of a second constriction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the “truthful lie” of beauty concealing pain. The prism’s rainbow reprise at the end reweights the entire inquiry without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture and image; no thematic echo is spoken aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to light and texture. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold detected. One near-redundancy—“faint hum of the quartz” / “shimmered faintly”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—objects as vessels of human grief—is familiar, but the frost-map method and the “truthful lie” conceit give it fresh inflection. Specificity of the glassblower’s loss grounds the concept. Risk is moderate; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>
