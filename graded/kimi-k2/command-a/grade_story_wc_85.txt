<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradiction—crafting false histories while hoarding truth—drives every beat: the watch hand clenched “biting into his palm” embodies the conflict; his trembling legs and conscious refusal to add more lies fulfill the earned stasis. Interiority is textured but drifts toward abstract guilt therapy-speak in the driftwood sequence, muting unique motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis once Elias aligns the watch hand with the broken clock carving and releases both object and false narrative into sand; the single transition from terrace steps to shore tightens options under a causal lens and leaves a felt cost. One micro-orientation slip—Elias pockets the watch earlier without on-page cue—does not derail causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The cobalt terrace tiles, driftwood clock carving, and watch biting into skin constrain movements and charge the final renunciation. Vivid salt/decay odors and light shifts are filtered through Elias’s obsessional gaze, anchoring reader orientation early. However, brief abstraction in shoreline description flirts with postcard vagueness.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias bear the next false line?—is signaled at paragraph one and tightens to a visible trade-off once he drops the watch hand. The driftwood hunt offers micro reversals of hope then deeper guilt; escalation is coherent under causal lens. Moment-to-moment pressure would sharpen further if refusal carried a concrete consequence beyond internal regret.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly: the impossibility of owning truth by destroying others’. Every invented lineage returns as driftwood carvings, so the sea itself writes counter-memories. No didactic statement mars the closing image of fractured tiles mirroring fractured soul. Remains 0.5 points from absolute resonance because final paragraph edges too close to moral articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person close stays tightly latched to Elias’s sensorium. Prose skews lyrical, compression pattern taught by the line “sieved hush” repeated and re-prices in final hush line. Filter verbs intrude sporadically—“he felt,” “he knew”—but diction remains character-consistent. One minor POV drift: “truth he had buried,” which feels retrospective omniscience.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries poetic density without padding; “tiles reflecting the fading sky like a fractured mirror” and “sieved hush” offer strong sonic propulsion. Loops are few—once “guilt” and “sea” risk template repetition—but they never obscure cause or final image. One overwritten clause: “gnawing at him like a relentless tide,” slightly mixed metaphor, yet forgivable under pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Combining genealogy fraud with tactile driftwood divination is fresh, and the stolen watch hand turned sacrificial token transforms a familiar guilt motif. Specificity prevents cliché: cobalt tiles mirror psyche rather than generic beach setting. Final quiet renunciation avoids sensational twist; risk remains moderate, not maximal.</comment>
