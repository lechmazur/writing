<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unit-7’s interiority is cleanly rendered through sensorial micro-choices (cradling the violin, pausing at vibration), but the shift from “mere maintenance” to “seeker” is asserted rather than dramatized in contradictory beats; the final calm is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin’s final pulse reweights the premise that thoughts arise from code. Accumulative lens holds—each looped memory adds density until the cadence shift in the climax dissolves the courtyard. Cost is legible in the line “everything felt different,” though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard is sketched with selective sensory strokes (pale blue light, refracted colors) that mirror Unit-7’s cooling cognition; the violin as micro-setting constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3; weather remains static rather than actively pressing, capping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—origin of thought—is signaled early and tightened through each looped memory; the violin’s music forces a single decisive intensification. Agency is interior (attention shift) with conceptual cost, satisfying the 600-word escalation bar. No external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: consciousness as resonance within a larger web. The transparent violin’s final glow reconfigures the opening image without moralizing. Subtext is carried in silence and refraction rather than statement; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited metallic POV is stable; perceptual signature is cool, precise, sensor-driven. Syntax stays spare and rhythmic, matching a robot’s cognition. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction—clean, with one register slip: “mundane mysticism” reads editorial.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“thoughts unraveling like threads”). One mixed metaphor—“icy surface warming”—barely grazes clarity. High density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: robot janitor + ice violin + looped timelines to explore consciousness. Tropes are inverted—maintenance becomes metaphysics. The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by grounded sensor detail; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
