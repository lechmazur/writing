<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation is clear—recover the matrix chip—but interiority is generic (“his mind racing”). The “perpetually surprised” trait is label-only; it never constrains or enables a choice. A single micro-choice (inserting the chip) earns the ending, yet lacks embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chip reweights Kael’s sense of belonging. Causal chain is linear—find three pieces, slot them in—without tightening or felt price. Orientation is clean; no teleporting props, but escalation is mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Observatory details are vivid (dust, stained glass, brass box) and filtered through Kael’s drone-pilot gaze. Setting constrains movement—narrow alcoves, spiral stairs—yet never turns into a decisive obstacle. Final image uses star map as charged object, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode belonging via chip—is signaled early. Pressure rises only by location change; no narrowing options or resource loss. Agency is present but frictionless; luck (drone finds every piece) undercuts escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the chip’s holographic stars, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext is thin; pilgrim’s whispers and star trails remain ornamental rather than interrogated. Resonance is mild but coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael; no head-hopping. Voice is serviceable, not distinctive—“sharp-eyed,” “perpetually surprised” repeat without deepening. Drone-tech diction is accurate, rhythm steady, no elision taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold. Occasional filler (“the air smelled of dust and old parchment”) but no figurative muddle. Sentence variety adequate; final paragraph achieves quiet lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Drone-plus-ancient-observatory mash-up feels fresh, yet plot beats are standard quest template. “Frequency of belonging” is abstract tech-mysticism; not transformed by specific lived detail. Risk level is moderate.</comment>
