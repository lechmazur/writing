<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—mending broken promises for his vanished sister—anchors every beat; the embodied memory of her plea sharpens the final image. Interiority is concrete (“fix what’s broken” echoes in micro-choices), yet the rebellion trait is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choice at the drop—hand trembling as he passes the bottle—earns the quiet renunciation of further action. Cost is felt in the half-full satchel and retreat into shadow, but the sister remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elias carries the storm, therefore he must evade patrol drones; because he succeeds, the sky mends. Closure is a Charged Poise—truce glows, but he turns away, cost legible in “half-full satchel.” Orientation is clear by line 4. Minor causality wobble: patrol drone chase resolves via “narrow crevice” without prior setup, a convenience rather than earned constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade’s frozen clock and flickering neon physically constrain timing and mood; the drone slips through “narrow crevice” between abandoned buildings, proving setting shapes tactics. Sensory selection is urgent—cool glass, crackling air—filtered through Elias’s courier priorities. Micro-setting (bottle, drone parts) functions as extension of body and stakes. Final glow on retreating figure recharges the arcade’s ghostly echo, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the storm to heal the border—is signaled early and tightened once when patrol drone forces evasive dive. Escalation is causal: each scanner sweep raises risk, narrowing options. Cost is visible in trembling hands and the quiet forfeiture of staying to witness the truce. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (crevice) slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending fractures emerges from Elias’s embodied labor—letters, drone, storm—not from statement. Subtext in “respectfully rebellious” delivery and half-full satchel implies endless task. Final image of shared sky offers non-literal answer: momentary unity born of individual risk. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “temporary respite.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, courier-pragmatic with lyrical undercurrent (“tempest trapped in amber”). Perceptual signature filters world through worn satchel and scavenged tech. No dialogue; internal texture remains coherent. Compression (“Tonight, we’re not just delivering mail…”) risks overt articulation but stays within POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“storm in a bottle,” “brittle hush”) and never muddles clarity. Occasional elevated diction (“encroaching dusk”) slightly drifts from courier lexicon but remains consistent. Final paragraph achieves cadence shift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of courier myth and bottled weather feels fresh; trope of border smuggling is retooled through scavenger tech and epistolary hope. Specificity of “linking absences” as drone-building method is memorable. Transformation test: story collapses if storm or arcade removed. Minor risk in patrol-drone cliché, offset by luminous truce image.</comment>
