<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is abstract and oracular rather than embodied; no contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene. Motivation (“illuminate hidden assumptions”) is stated repeatedly but never tested by a micro-choice that costs him anything. The final declaration lands as authorial summation, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the possession dissolves when assumptions are exposed. Causality is thematic rather than sequential—each rhetorical question weakens the foe—so Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Cost is conceptual (loss of unquestioned reality) but not dramatized as personal loss to the priest, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Dimensional anchor” is evoked through resonant silence and shifting walls; the black palette becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—void, tremor, shimmer—filtered through the priest’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the surreal frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent cosmic possession—is declared early. Escalation is tonal (muffled → sharpened clarity) rather than causal; the priest’s questions tighten the conceptual noose. Agency is intellectual; no tangible price is paid, so pressure feels abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of questioning hidden assumptions emerges organically from the priest’s method. Final declaration reweights silence from absence to clarity, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext is carried by silence and void rather than dialogue, though abstraction keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, elevated, and ceremonial—fitting a mythic guardian. Syntax modulates between looping incantation and stark declaration. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; perceptual signature is strong. Occasional oracular drift (“the unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“void given form”) are coherent within the surreal frame. A few abstract nouns (“assumptions,” “truths”) could be sharpened, but no artifacts mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a time-bending priest who weaponizes rhetorical questions against a being of pure assumption. Palette-of-void and silence-as-substance are non-obvious yet fully integrated. Risky abstraction mostly pays off, though slight conceptual overload keeps it under 8.5.</comment>
