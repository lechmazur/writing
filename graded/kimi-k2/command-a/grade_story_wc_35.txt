<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “sandpaper rough memories” is clear and embodied through her tactile subsuming of remorse, yet interiority drifts toward summary (“her heart lighter”) rather than contradictory impulse under peak pressure. The final choice to dissolve the shard is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion dissolves and Elara’s sorrow is lightened, with felt cost in the tear-filled subsuming of the shard. Causal chain holds—tidal-pool reading leads to pavilion, each memory touched refines the next—but a slight ellipsis in how the shard’s dissolution alters her future choices keeps it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The desert-after-rain scent, frost-rimed coral walls, and starlit tidal pools are vivid and selective, filtering through Elara’s palate-centric perception. The pavilion itself constrains her path and final act, satisfying the 9+ gate; only a touch of orientational vagueness in the descent sequence prevents the top band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—alleviating remorse—tightens when each memory tasted raises the risk of being overwhelmed. The single decisive intensification occurs at the central shard, where Elara’s agency subsumes collective remorse at visible emotional cost. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of remorse as literalized burden emerges through sensory particulars rather than statement; the final image of dawn-washed dunes reweights the opening “unspoken dream” without moralizing. A faint hint of therapeutic summary (“shed layers of her own regrets”) slightly blunts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with gustatory metaphors consistent to Elara’s gift. Rhythm modulates between expansive desert lines and clipped, icy interior phrases. Compression is purposeful; no head-hop or register drift. A few near-generic phrasings (“glowing faintly in the moonlight”) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Minor scaffold—“the memory flooded her senses” twice—barely registers. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fusion of culinary synesthesia with crystallized remorse feels fresh and inevitable; the coral pavilion’s icebound contradiction is a memorable invention. Risk in the lyric mode pays off. Only the faint echo of familiar “storm-cleansed” tropes keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>
