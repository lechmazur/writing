<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Guardian’s stillness and mirror use are embodied, but the “teach darkness the value of stars” motive is asserted rather than dramatized; no interior contradiction surfaces under pressure, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shutter-weaving pattern builds density toward a Charged Poise closure. Anchors clear by 80 words; final image reweights the premise with felt cost as stranger leaves lighter. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and dental-mirror glints are selective and POV-filtered; the shutter constellation at the end constrains the stranger’s gaze and crystallizes the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stranger’s need to release a secret—tightens once when mirror reflection reframes self-perception. Agency is the guardian’s silent endurance; cost is the stranger’s departure and guardian’s continued solitude. No reversals, but deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of finding light within darkness emerges organically from shutter patterns and mirror reflection; final constellation image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in silence and gesture is consistent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to guardian’s perceptual signature; diction is spare, rhythmic, and aligned with calm intensity. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal texture remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“spiralingly calm”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: canal guardian using dental mirror and shutter-weaving as silent pedagogy. Premise avoids cliché through tactile specificity and quiet closure. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
