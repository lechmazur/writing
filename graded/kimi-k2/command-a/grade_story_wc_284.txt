<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—scars, pillbox, breath in cold—but the “unused courage” epiphany is asserted more than dramatized; the letter functions as external prompt rather than earned internal shift, softening the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each snow-code and pillbox touch layers density until the hollow-tree letter reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—dawn path, mist lifting—with felt cost (renouncing the pill) legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silver mist, tilted earth, and scarred tree are selective and tactile; the pillbox serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Weather and terrain subtly guide each step without ornamental overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming courage—tightens through deciphering snow-codes and the pillbox temptation. One meaningful deepening: letter reframes courage as memory, narrowing options and exacting the cost of leaving the pill unused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding from remnants emerges through object, landscape, and choice; final image of dawn path offers non-literal resonance. Avoids moralizing, but the letter’s didactic tone slightly blunts subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual bias—cold breath, worn engravings, tilt of earth. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“forgotten veil,” “canvas waiting to be filled”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar burned-spy redemption arc is refreshed by snow-code navigation and pillbox as memory-engine; the tilted-earth metaphor feels specific. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over twist—but execution is confident.</comment>
