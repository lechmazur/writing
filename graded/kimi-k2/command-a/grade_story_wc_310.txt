<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tremor, deliberate dial-turning, and the coins’ glint all embody her quiet enthusiasm. Motivation (“wavelength align with purpose”) is stated early and re-anchored in each beat, but the internal contradiction between hope and doubt is more asserted than dramatized until the final coin drop. The earned cost is present: she accepts the burden of navigator, yet the flaw driving inevitable mistakes is only lightly sketched. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with minor under-dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the observatory becomes a bridge, Lira’s stance crystallizes, and the cost is the open-ended responsibility of rebirth. Causal lens holds—each coin submersion tightens her path. Orientation is clear by line 3. One micro-turn: static bursts distilled into usable prophecy. No teleporting props; the coins and apparatus remain tracked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ambered observatory is tactile—rusted metal, humming apparatus, static light on glass—and constrains her movements to the deck and the machine. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over sight, mirroring her hushed urgency. The setting evolves: at closure the same amber glass refracts rebirth, charging the final image. Micro-setting (coins, dials) doubles as setting and tool, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the backwards prophecy to resurrect the contracted universe—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each coin distilled narrows her options until refusal is impossible. Cost is visible: the distilled essence glows with “otherworldly light,” implying irreversible commitment. One tightening beat suffices; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of rebirth-through-fragment emerges organically from the coins and static, never sermonized. Subtext whispers in the “static bursts that seemed to echo through time itself.” Final image of the observatory as “beacon of hope” reweights prior stellar doubt without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: rebirth is possible, not guaranteed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“ambered observatory deck,” “stellar doubt”—with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Compression (“deafening and silent”) is taught early and paid off at climax. Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices glints, hums, and light shifts that others dismiss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“stars whispered secrets in static bursts”) are fresh and coherent. One mixed metaphor—“static bursts that seemed to echo through time itself”—slightly blurs sonic/temporal logic but does not obscure causality. Rhythm modulates naturally with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Post-universe-contraction setting and backwards prophecy feel fresh, synthesized through Lira’s coin-divination rather than generic sci-fi tropes. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on the specific coins and their lost civilizations. Risky lyric compression is purposeful and paid off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
