<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“watcher’s burden,” “silent vow”) rather than embodied contradiction; the parachute buckle’s tactile memory anchors motive, yet the seeker’s final choice feels more declared than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pattern’s revelation reweights the premise and the arbor’s glow confirms the cost of trust preserved. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift escalate stakes; orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor functions as both macro-setting and charged micro-object; its shifting cloud-mirrors and branch-whispers constrain perception and guide the seeker’s revision. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, culminating in the arbor’s intensified glow that locks the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled early and tightened through escalating pattern recognition; the final crystallization of the sequence forces a stance that forecloses failure. Cost is felt in the “weight” carried forward, though it could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust-as-burden emerges organically from the seeker’s tactile memory and the arbor’s test; the ending’s non-literal reconfiguration avoids moralizing. Subtext in the buckle’s clink and the arbor’s sway carries the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic compression that mirrors the seeker’s pattern-seeking mind. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop or register drift. The arbor’s “whispering leaves” and the buckle’s “soft clink” are character-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, occasionally tipping into stacked metaphors (“soundless echo,” “ethereal glow”) that slightly dilute clarity under pressure. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds. Final cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—lone seeker, sky-realm, symbolic talisman—are transformed through tactile specificity and the arbor’s living pattern. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in the lyric mode itself, which pays off.</comment>
