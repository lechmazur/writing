<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“velvet disquiet”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final “I remember” feels more ritual than hard choice, so the cost is present yet not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s sigh and warmer air mark a before/after shift. Causal chain (silent foghorn → phonograph → deciphering symbols) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the garden’s response is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is specific and atmospheric; its etched oak bark constrains Elara’s deciphering action. Micro-setting (phonograph shaving) also charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover what the garden remembers—tightens once the prophecy is heard. Agency is present in Elara’s deliberate walk and spoken words, but the visible price (risk, exhaustion) is only lightly implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-continuity emerges organically from orchard soil and Elara’s task. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“gnarled trees heavy with fruit that seemed to hum”). No head-hopping; compression and elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Minor scaffold (“she began to walk”) and a few stacked modifiers keep it just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Skyscraper orchard + phonograph prophecy is a fresh synthesis; emotional specificity grounds the fantastical frame. Transformation test passes—removing the orchard or the dead language collapses the story.</comment>
