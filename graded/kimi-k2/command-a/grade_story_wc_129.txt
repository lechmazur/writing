<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s longing to belong is palpable and embodied in her reed-work, but the interior contradictions and micro-choices under pressure remain generalized; the final “recognition” is more stated than dramatized, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration—Echo’s tag on Lira’s sculpture reweights her outsider status to belonging—yet the causal trail from tag-hunt to communal acceptance is compressed into montage, leaving the cost lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly evoked and return in the final image with reweighted meaning; however, the environment never physically constrains choices—its pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (belonging) is signaled early and tightens through each Echo fragment; the communal web frays then re-knits around Lira’s search, but the decisive tightening beat is narrated rather than enacted, muting the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The theme of kinship-as-web emerges organically from Lira’s sculpting and the Echo tags; the ending’s quiet reconfiguration invites reflection without moralizing, though the conceptual cost is more luminous than cutting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet disciplined, and the rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional lyrical inflation (“luminescent ache”) is purposeful. No loops or scaffold, though a few stock phrases (“whispers of a time beyond…”) slightly dull the edge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The marsh-reed sculptor tracking an elusive street-artist through living obsidian is a fresh synthesis; the risk of quiet lyric closure pays off, though the premise’s deeper implications feel gently explored rather than fully mined.</comment>
