<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s empathy drives her choice to finish the sculpture, but interior contradiction stays summary-level. Embodied tension appears in the chisel’s taps, yet the interior monologue recycles gentle platitudes. Cost is legible—she loses the daylight hedgehog-gate—but the flaw that forces the mistake is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Non-linear lyric design; closure is Earned Stasis via the hedgehog’s re-curl, but its symbolic link is slightly forced after late introduction. Orientation stays clear via sensory anchors, yet causality slips when the porcelain insulator leaps to “conduit-turned-amplifier” without earlier rule seed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Alder grove is undersold as active constraint; only fiduciary mention of bark guiding sounds. Environment pressures Elara via dwindling light and hedgehog as timer, so one key choice shifts. No spatial mis-tracking, but limited sensory diversity beyond filtered sun.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock silent music aloud—faces one on-page test: will cracks crack back. Escalation is soft; tension rises slowly as files chip but no hard pivot or tightening. Insulator’s role feels coincidental, not an active complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme surfaces through the porcelain insulator recharging prior fragments, forming a quiet CR. No didactic moral; theme emerges through Elara’s literal making of audible song from silence. Final image re-weights the grove from mute witness to active chorus, felt and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical cadence fits contemplative mood; sensory compression under time-restriction is clear. Filter-verb stack dilutes peak beats (“she felt the insulator’s presence grow stronger”), otherwise propulsive. Dialogue absent, so one of-field POV remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Phrase-level sculpting: “sound that bridges the silent world” runs ornate; clarity intact but one metaphor mash瞬産. Sentence rhythm is hypnotic, propelling reflection, yet occasional bloat costs momentum. No near-duplicate lines, no typo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fairly fresh synthesis: stress-crack sheet music and porcelain relic bridging tree-song. Hedgehog timer remains a distinctive device. Charged stasis toward silence as music is elegant, non-obvious payoff. Renunciation without dramatic bombast keeps ingenuity intact.</comment>
