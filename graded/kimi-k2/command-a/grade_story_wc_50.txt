<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “peripherally focused” trait shows in how he notices light angles—but the story never dramatizes a contradictory impulse; fixing the timer is a straight-line obsession. The final “peace” is asserted rather than embodied, so the cost feels abstract. Still, the embodied humming and tactile handling of gears give him specificity beyond archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s hum reweights the cavern and Elias’s mission, and the “warm, fragile” echo carries felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of reflection study tightens into the dusk alignment beat. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s reflective surfaces actively constrain Elias’s method; the shifting light angles are both tool and obstacle. The setting is more than backdrop—it supplies the physics he reverse-engineers. Sensory detail is selective (veins of silver, faint twilight crack) and filtered through his craft.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture wonder before the season ends—is signaled early and tightens when dusk alignment becomes the last viable moment. The deepening is Elias’s realization that the harvest is “only the beginning,” foreclosing rest. Cost is present but generalized (“he slept little”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus transience emerges through the concrete act of bottling echoes; no moral is stated. The final image of “warm, fragile” wonder reweights the cellar metaphor without sermonizing. Subtext is carried in gesture—cupping the invisible—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “store wonder in the cellar of reason” teaches the metaphor early and returns charged. Syntax modulates with intensity—long reflective sentences collapse into short, tactile beats during repair. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elias’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold: “Days turned into nights, and nights blurred into days” is a cliché loop, but it doesn’t stall momentum. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The “harvest of echoes” premise is fresh, and the integration of optics with memory feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric mode, but it pays off in the final reconfiguration. Some phrasing edges toward familiar wonder-preserve tropes, yet the reflective-locksmith angle adds specificity.</comment>
