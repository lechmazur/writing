<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority is luminous but drifts at times toward abstraction (“weight of centuries” rather than felt memory); Elara’s final micro-choice to release the bond and rebind with herself lands with visible glow yet lacks earlier bodily stakes to maximize cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer intensifies until the final moonlit orchard image crystallizes new meaning. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—“the bond you desire is not what you remember”—framed as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fairy-tale orchard with “fruit that shimmered like captured stars” and saffron wind is vividly filtered through Elara’s nose and memories; the scented wind literally shapes her conjuring mechanics late in the scene, grounding high fantasy in sensuous immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single clear stake—restore a bond—progressively narrowed by the guardian’s warning that it must be re-invented, not restored. Pressure shifts from external quest to internal renunciation, tightening options until she lets the old shape burn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of transformation-through-loss emerges from concrete particulars (fortune slip, spiced wind, phoenix-mane guardian). The final silence of cosmic intimacy reweights the earlier longing without explicit moral, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric, perfumed diction fits Elara’s heightened perception; steady yet emotionally modulated cadence captures her paradoxical steadiness under moonlit hallucination. No head-hop, sensory focus remains convincingly hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is lean for its lyric load; only light abstract drift around “cosmic intimacy” that repeats twice. Otherwise precise sensory phrasing, no paraphrase loops, rhythmic variation, no artifact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar elements (phoenix, guardian, orchard) are re-mixed via smell-as-magic mechanic and internalized metamorphosis arc. Final shift from external summon to self-reclamation feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
