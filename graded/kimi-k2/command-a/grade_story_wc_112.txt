<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “icy warmth” layering reckless obsession beneath composure plays in every micro-choice; the final manual lever correction is an earned renunciation that balances her flaw against the station’s survival, the cost of partial success showing on the humming nexus and the wing-light outside.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat—activation, overload, sprint, stabilisation—tightens because/therefore linkages. Closure delivers a crystallised ‘time ripple’ and abandoned safety path, cost stamped on rebooting systems; the ripple fulfils Q2’s test while no gate failures arise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Station, nexus glow, and wing-creature bioluminescence are integrated as living pressure gauges—luminal shifts intensify with triage urgency. The magnetic nexus’s changing glow colour-codes risk levels, directly constraining Elara’s tactical decision point at stabilisation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove temporal shift—escalates to physical jeopardy when nexus overload threatens station integrity. One decisive tightening after she pulls the lever: either contain the energy and accept partial proof with institutional threat, or lose everything. Agency drives the course, coincidences absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>‘Sideways time’ as conceptual engine is dramatised through device limits and craft denial, never abstract lecture. Final image—the now-louder hush outside, Elara’s fresh burden—invites reflection on the social cost of new knowledge without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perception; syntax slows only where physical fixating occurs (“her fingers brushing the cold metal”). No head-hop, filter verbs rare. Rhythmic modulations mirror surge-tension moments, avoided repetitiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Precise nouns and concrete verbs (“magnetic nexus pulsed”) maintain sci-fi texture without jargon blur; occasional poetic metaphor (“metallic scar”) is anchored in POV. No loops or scaffold. Paragraphs cut cleanly to acceleration measures; climax prose remains sharp and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The blend of hard-SF chassis and temporal metaphysics feels fresh; the sideways-time proof pivots on everyday engineer error rather than heroics. Synthesis of relatable obsession and alien setting yields distinctive emotional vocabulary—earned rather than gimmicked.</comment>
