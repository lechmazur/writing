<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers traced…heart heavy”), but the contradiction between her gift and isolation is summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“ready to chart a new course”), satisfying the Earned Stasis test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sketch stroke layers density until the dawn image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s resolve reconfigures her pariah status into calling—yet the causal chain from shutdown to this moment is more asserted than shown, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The deck’s “echoed silence” and star-bent light are selective, sensory, and thematically charged; the compass rose constrains her tactile choice and returns in the final gleam, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightens through each sketch line; the cost is the solitude she accepts at dawn. One meaningful deepening suffices, though external pressure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of mutable “true north” emerges organically from Elara’s sketching ritual and final stance; no moralizing, only resonant image. The ambiguity between curse and calling lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic modulation under pressure (“Each stroke…was a deliberate act”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop or register drift. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“temporally stretched cosmos”) skirts purple but stays within POV. No loops or scaffold; final image lands without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Temporal-collapse premise is familiar, yet the fusion with inherited star-sketching ritual and tactile compass rose feels specific and inevitable. Risk lies in quiet lyric closure rather than twist, executed coherently.</comment>
