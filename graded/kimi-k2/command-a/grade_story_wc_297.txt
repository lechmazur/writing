<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her roots…tingled”), but the “root-bound” trait is asserted rather than dramatized; her choices are internally consistent yet the covenant’s personal cost to her remains abstract until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant mends with visible light-ripple and Elara’s earned poise. Causal chain holds (clipping → scars → pedestal), but the maze’s logic feels lightly situational rather than strictly causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s dusk hue and living hedges are selective and atmospheric; the clipping’s silver glow and scar-heat serve as micro-settings that constrain her path, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the covenant—is signaled early and tightens once when the hidden path appears. Cost is felt in the glowing scars, but the price remains more luminous than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of fractured wholeness emerges through the covenant’s repair and Elara’s rooted identity; the final image of starlit readiness offers quiet resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias; diction (“otherworldly hue,” “anxious elation”) modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“eclipsed covenant,” “intersection of dreams”) flirts with abstraction but never stalls momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar “chosen guardian mends broken magic” arc is refreshed by the living-maze and root-bound physiology; the synthesis feels specific to this glade rather than generic fantasy.</comment>
