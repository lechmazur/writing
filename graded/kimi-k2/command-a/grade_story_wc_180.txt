<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her fingers brushing the ribbon, the quartz glint—but the “feisty” trait is asserted more than embodied; her choices pivot on reflection rather than contradiction. The final renunciation of the old vow is earned, yet the cost feels generalized (“months of doubt”) rather than dramatized in a single, sharp beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the transformed vow, ribbon woven into the glowing tree, reconfigures meaning with visible cost. Causal chain is intact—key unlocks scroll, petals bloom tree, compass points to ribbon—though the breach itself is backstory exposition rather than on-page event.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is sensory and specific, its rafters and roots constraining Elara’s climb and later offering the altar compartment. Light through shattered glass and glowing petals charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renewing the deciduous vow—tightens when Elara realizes the breach may be necessary shedding. One clear turn: she stops trying to restore the old contract and instead “transforms” it, paying with the ribbon’s permanent loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme of renewal-through-loss emerges organically from the orchard’s cycle and Elara’s reframed vow. The final image avoids moralizing; the glowing ribbon-tree offers resonant, non-literal answer to generational continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent—“quartz-eye mender,” “chaotic beauty”—with rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so bullets skipped; perceptual signature remains sharp throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“verdant sanctuary,” “deciduous vow”) skirts purple but stays within POV. No loops or mixed metaphors; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cathedral-orchard and quartz-eyed mender synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, specific vision. The breach-as-shedding inversion feels inevitable in hindsight, lifting the piece above template.</comment>
