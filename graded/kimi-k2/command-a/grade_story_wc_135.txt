<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her boots sinking,” “fingers trembled”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final acceptance of vocation feels more bestowed than wrestled. The keeper’s appearance supplies external pressure, yet Elara’s micro-choice to raise the trumpet again is under-motivated—no visible cost or flaw complicates it. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and the moment of belonging lands with earned poise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “absences filling with something tangible” crystallizes Elara’s new stance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory discovery layers density until the trumpet’s note reweights the world. The keeper’s exit is slightly convenient, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (“salt and petrichor,” “water pooled in patterns”). The setting constrains movement—soft sand, cliffs, half-buried hull—and the trumpet’s echo literally charges the stones, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; only the keeper’s cliff descent feels lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compile fragments into meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the carved wood links to the lost ship. The trumpet’s second note is the decisive escalation that forecloses Elara’s outsider stance. Cost is felt in the keeper’s abdication and Elara’s solitary acceptance, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of “navigated absences” emerges organically from Elara’s tactile discoveries and the trumpet’s re-voicing of loss. The final image reweights wreckage from ruin to promise without moralizing. Subtext in the keeper’s “time is done” carries centuries of burden, but the piece avoids overt allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“heartbeat in the rhythm of her search”). Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. The keeper’s diction is distinct enough, though brief. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory bias remains Elara’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“she felt a shift—a presence, a voice”) could be tighter. Metaphors are coherent and scene-driven. No loops or register drift. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The “archivist of ocean-spray” premise freshens the familiar “restorer of lost stories” trope through coastal specificity and the trumpet’s sonic magic. The keeper’s transference of duty is a quiet but non-obvious turn. Risk is moderate; transformation feels specific to this harbor and this voice.</comment>
