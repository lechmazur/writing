<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara’s persistence is embodied in the pulse-following beat; the “protect vulnerable voices” motive remains consistent, yet the interiority flirts with stock phrases (“mist clung like sorrow”) and the photograph feels received rather than earned through an on-page dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The closure beat—slipping the warm photograph into her satchel—qualifies as Charged Poise (earned), but arrival feels foreshortened: pulses never tighten or obstruct her path; only one micro-choice (“she nodded”) stands between discovery and finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The mist and marble archways evoke mood and spatial depth yet stop short of constraining any final move; the hearing aid acts as textured environment-for-tool, but none of these details shift tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—safeguard a forgotten voice—lacks a felt on-page cost beyond walking; a single escalation beat (finding the crevice-photo) advances but never threatens failure or forces trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—voices deserve permanence—emerges organically from beat to beat, but the narrative repeats the thesis with gentle abstraction rather than letting final gesture reprice it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person interior voice is consistent and evocative (“reeling hush”), avoids head-hop, and modulates to warmer cadence in closing paragraph; only occasional drift into generic metaphor dulls the texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Clean syntax and atmospheric detail are largely effective; mild paraphrase loops (“fragile voice... forgot to listen”) and thesaurus glimmers flicker without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The premise—“contact tracer for hearts,” dead calls through hearing aids—is fresh and non-congruent; risk lies in soft edges, yet the image lingers as specific invention.</comment>
