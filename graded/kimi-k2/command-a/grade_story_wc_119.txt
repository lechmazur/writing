<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Li Wei’s interiority is evocative (“felt an sudden surge of clarity”) but remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The shift from writer to “conductor of fate” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost of the new identity is not yet legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Li Wei sets out to claim destiny, reconfiguring options. Yet the causal chain from microdot specs → decoded dream → lighthouse journey is sketched rather than demonstrated; the “accidental brush” feels like a deus-ex-machina activation rather than earned agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kitchen’s clatter and refrigerator hum are nicely selective; the lighthouse image is atmospherically charged. However, neither setting constrains a concrete choice in-scene; they serve mood more than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unraveling hidden life—signaled early. Pressure tightens only narratively (“journey began”) rather than through an on-page beat that forecloses an option or exacts a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of open secrets emerges implicitly through fortunes and microdots. Final image of lighthouse as threshold resonates, but the conceptual cost is still gestural; ambiguity lingers without a sharper reweighting of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with controlled rhythm (“whisper secrets that only a select few could decipher”). No POV drift; perceptual signature remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and mostly free of loops; occasional elevated diction (“transpose life into a new key”) borders on the ornate but stays within voice. Minor scaffold in repeated “as if” constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of fortune-cookie mysticism with espionage microdots feels fresh; lighthouse as metaphor for open secrets is non-obvious. Risk is moderate—concept could tilt gimmicky—but specificity of Chinatown kitchen grounds it.</comment>
