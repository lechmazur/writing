<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “chronologically homesick” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choice. The final collapse carries felt cost yet motivation for “unheard symphonies” stays atmospheric, not causally tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harp’s resonance crystallizes the mirrored horizon with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though orientation is soft until ~150 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glass spire and frozen lake are vividly selective, filtering through the POV’s yearning. The mirrored horizon constrains perception and charges the final image; micro-setting (nautilus shell) doubles as tool and canvas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting memory into unheard symphony—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via dawn’s deadline and exhaustion, forcing the final act. Cost is felt in collapse, but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Theme of mirrored possibility emerges from concrete particulars; no moralizing. Final image reweights the premise non-literally, offering resonant ambiguity about longing and creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail. No dialogue; prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, sustaining the upturned hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors verge on purple but pattern is taught early. No loops or scaffold; final image lands clean. Minor register drift in “conductor of unheard symphonies.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-cookie writer, nautilus shell, and mirrored horizon; avoids cliché. Conceptual risk is high but coherence holds; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
