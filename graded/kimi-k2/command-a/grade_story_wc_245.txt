<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skin-language absorption and tactile cartography are embodied, not labeled—but the final beat of self-discovery is slightly abstract, muting the cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the compass needle stills at the stillpoint, crystallizing her stance with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only a whisper of orientation drift in the forest’s spatial cues keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and platinum ring function as micro-settings that constrain her path; the pool’s liquid silence charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though “otherworldly light” flirts with cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping her own heart—tightens when the melody’s pull forces a choice; the cost is the surrender of external bearings. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interior cartography emerges through concrete action; the stillpoint reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of the forever-still needle offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile perception; rhythmic control mirrors the ultrasonic hum. No head-hopping; slight register lift in “crystallized emotions” is brief and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined except for one mixed metaphor (“quiet blaze of determination”). No loops or scaffold; final paragraph could trim a near-repetition of “stillpoint.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic cartography and emotional navigation; the compass-as-truth-seeker trope is transformed through Elara’s blindness and skin-language gift. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
