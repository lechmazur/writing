<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembled,” “heart pounding”), but the traveler’s sudden wisdom feels externally supplied rather than earned through her contradictory impulses; the final renunciation is credible yet slightly under-costed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s embrace of stillness reweights her goal under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the emerald’s fade and the traveler’s disappearance supply felt cost, though the traveler’s agency edges toward coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s shifting attention; the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is signaled early and tightens when the traveler reframes stillness as endurance; the single deepening is coherent, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of stillness versus spark emerges organically from Elara’s arc; the final silence offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the traveler’s didactic line skirts thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and a distinct perceptual signature (“radiant hush,” “patterns in the static”); no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, with high information density; minor scaffold (“seemed to hold,” “as if”) appears but never near closure; figurative language is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician-beautician and aurora-grotto stakes; the stillness/spark inversion feels inevitable in hindsight, though the premise edges close to familiar lyric-fantasy templates.</comment>
