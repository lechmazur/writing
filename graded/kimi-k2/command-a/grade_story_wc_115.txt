<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and filial guilt are sketched early, but interiority stays summary-level (“restless need,” “weight of her father’s swallowed truth”) rather than embodied contradiction. The valve wheel becomes a prop of decision, yet her turn lacks a visible cost or flaw-driven hesitation. The shift from doubt to belief is asserted rather than dramatized in micro-choices. Closure is achieved, but the emotional price feels generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-scene causality is clear: because she enters the tunnel, she finds the wheel, which releases the ghosts. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and audible sighs, satisfying the causal lens. However, the father’s radio clues are back-loaded exposition rather than planted constraints that shape tactics. No orientation debt; anchors arrive within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp air, jagged glass, and encrusted valve wheel are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s explorer gaze. Environment constrains movement and supplies the key artifact. The final chamber’s frozen gears mirror the stalled lives, charging the release image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under rising dread, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the ghosts to lay her father’s truth to rest—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when whispers become screams, forcing the turn of the wheel. Cost is implied (fear, cold, shadows lunging) but not made viscerally irreversible; the ghosts’ relief is external rather than a personal forfeiture. One meaningful escalation beat is present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of inherited belief versus empirical doubt emerges through action rather than sermon. The swallowed truth motif threads from childhood dismissal to present reckoning, culminating in a non-literal exorcism. Subtext is strongest in the valve wheel’s glow, reweighting her father’s “madness” into legacy. Final image avoids moralizing but edges toward tidy catharsis.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sensory filter; diction is lean, tactile, and consistent with a risk-taking urban explorer. No dialogue, so voice is carried by rhythmic description and internal perception. Occasional elevated phrases (“spectral figures,” “cavernous chamber”) slightly lift register beyond her likely lexicon, but not enough to break immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses under threat, longer ones in reflection. Figurative language is spare and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to echo,” “seemed to close in”) slightly dulls immediacy mid-scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The “ghost shift” trope is familiar, but grounding it in rusted factory relics and talk-radio fringe lore gives local specificity. Mara’s skeptical stance refreshes the usual believer arc. The valve wheel as literal key to release souls is functional rather than revelatory. Overall, a competent synthesis rather than a bold reimagining.</comment>
