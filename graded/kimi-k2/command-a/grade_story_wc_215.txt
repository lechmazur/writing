<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s astonishment is asserted, not embodied; interiority drifts into generic “quiet symphony” abstractions. His choices—finding box, performing ritual—feel externally scripted rather than compelled by contradictory impulses. The ghosts’ silence is noted, but Elias’s own unspoken weight never visibly costs him anything. Closure arrives as gentle uplift, not earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-scene default met; orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (awakening oasis) with conceptual cost (lifelong guardianship accepted). Causal chain is thin—box opens itself, ritual succeeds without setback—so escalation is more accumulative than driven. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Scorched wasteland and skeletal gardens are vividly sketched, but the oasis itself remains backdrop rather than tactical constraint. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. Sensory selection leans visual; wind and heat are noted but never threaten or enable the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore covenant—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: ghosts become visible, ritual required. Agency is present (Elias performs song), but no credible loss or resource depletion occurs; success feels pre-ordained. Coincidence (box opens alone) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of honoring silence emerges organically from ghosts’ muteness and Elias’s task. Subtext resides in the box’s shifting patterns and the ghosts’ flickering lights. Final image of new leaves avoids moralizing, yet the covenant’s social cost remains abstract. Complexity is hinted but not fully embraced; ambiguity is gentle rather than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias with consistent perceptual signature—“light filtered through broken glass,” “faint hum of bees long gone.” Diction is lyrical but disciplined, matching the “tranquilly perceptive” tone. No dialogue; prose carries subtext through imagistic attention. No POV drift or register mismatch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and selective, purposeful detail. Occasional soft phrases—“quiet symphony of solitude,” “shade of time”—edge toward poetic boilerplate but do not stall momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. High information density maintained; closure image is clear and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper restoring ghost-pact is fresh enough, yet tropes (lone caretaker, magical box, dying earth) remain recognizable. Specificity of beekeeping remnants and stained glass patterns helps. Transformation test: swap names and setting, emotional arc still functions, so originality is moderate. Risk-taking is modest but coherent.</comment>
