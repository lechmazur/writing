<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured, her motivations legible, her “shrewd innocence” active when it forces her toward the coral; yet some emotion edges into stock phrasing (“lotus-hearted”). Her renunciation cost is shown—she carries the coral and the vanished child’s memory out into the mist—but a stronger embodied pang would clinch higher ground.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens each new decrypted line densifies meaning until the final image reweights Elara’s purpose; pacing breathes without gaps. One smooth transition—anesthetic wears off / mist deepens—keeps causality intact. Closure lands in a crystallized, costed resolve: “Tell them the ocean still sings” redefines future options; felt cost visible.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Mist, condensation on doors, coral’s pulse—the details are selective and echo Elara’s shifting emotional gauge. Atmosphere is not mere drapery; the clammy jasmine scent limits how far she can see and thus how much risk she’s willing to shoulder once armed with the map.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the decoded promise to save the reef—intensifies with every smeared character she unknots. No coincidence resolves; final walk-out is her agency. Escalation is one steady tightening: each revealed line raises the moral cost of abandoning or fulfilling the vow.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Resilience reclaimed from ruins threads through coral, cast, vanished child, and translator; nothing preaches. Final line offers a resonant, non-moral answer: the ocean still sings—ambiguity intact, theme earned not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person internal, stable throughout, with syntax that lengthens then compresses under pressure. Figurative runs—“mist like exhaled doubts”—are purposeful and controlled, lending the piece a distinct cadence without lapsing into clutter. Dialogue absent; no violation.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose propels, sentence lengths modulate, sensory nouns strike precisely; only minor scaffold repeats (“faint glow…glow now steady”) dull the knife edge. No mixed metaphors or opacity, even in the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>New in the fusion of war-zone ephemera (plaster cast as cartography) and marine memory; the coral-as-cognition trope feels inevitable rather than clever. Specificity outweighs any derivative notes.</comment>
