<comment>Elara's tactile navigation of her anosmia-driven world is vivid and specific—her “hands, though steady, trembled with a calm born of both loss and resilience.” Yet her final crystallization (“ability to see what others could not”) slips slightly into summary epiphany rather than fully earned contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s conceptual repricing—her redefinition of “ordinary miracles” via the warm screw—reweights premise (loss ≠ deficit but new lens). Causality follows Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern builds from gear work → object handling → final perception shift; cost is the irretrievable past she now refuses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Setting breathes in fog and brass micro-detail; the worn birthing clamp charges choice and image. Only a mild white-room risk at entry because “nestled between cobblestone” remains generic, offset by tactile intimacy of tools and drip-clock heartbeat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—how she can remap connection after sensory loss—tightens once when the screw’s warmth forces a recalibration of perception. Agency is largely internal; outside pressure (Mira’s request) sparks but does not escalate further choices on page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Thematic resonance is organic: “miracles in the ordinary” surfaces via the screw’s reprise and Elara’s quiet redefinition. Final image avoids moralizing, though a faint thematic echo (“ordinary miracle”) in last line nicks full crispness.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Lyric, precise interiority (“quiet rhythm of the place, a sanctuary where time seemed to pause”) remains distinctive and consistent. Compresses efficiently; only a few abstract phrases lean reportative instead of embodied under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose rhythm breathes; syntax flexes with emotional cadence. No loops or redundancies, though “trembling calm” recurs twice in adjacent lines—mild micro-scaffold. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory loss midwifed through antique medical tool as metaphor for generational continuity; avoids standard tropes by grounding miracle in tactile weight of reused screw. Slight familiarity in “fog as timeless hush” tempers originality.</question>
