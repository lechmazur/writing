<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers brushing,” “poison seeping”), but the decisive shift from envy to gratitude is compressed into a single beat of dialogue rather than dramatized micro-choices; the cost is felt yet lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll’s final sentence crystallizes meaning and the cabin hums approval. Causal linkage is lyric rather than plot-driven; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though the grave visit is off-stage and the scroll’s agency is more metaphorical than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mountain cabin, birch scroll, and star-strewn expanse are selectively rendered and filter through Elara’s perception; the scroll’s glow and the cabin’s hum charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“distill chaos into narrative”—is signaled early and tightened when the scroll rewrites itself. The cost is conceptual (accepting present self) rather than visceral; escalation is a single deepening beat, sufficient under the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as continuum versus fragmented selves. The scroll’s final sentence offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“pine-scented walls,” “jaded wonder”). Patterned elision (“she remembered—or thought she remembered”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “feral nostalgia”) fits the reflective mode. No loops or scaffold; metaphors remain coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The lucid-dream chronicler who meets her own grave is a fresh synthesis; the scroll-as-map-of-mind trope is familiar but reweighted by the final sentence. Specificity of mountain cabin and birch bark grounds the concept.</comment>
