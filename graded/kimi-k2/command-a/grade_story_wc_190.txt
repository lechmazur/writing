<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the storm-glass vial externalizes his motive and Mira’s shift. The final “Silence taught you how to comfort yourself” crystallizes earned change with visible cost. Minor drift: Mira’s turmoil is sketched more than dramatized, limiting crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers silence’s texture until the final Charged Poise reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; closure lands on-page with felt cost (“her steps lighter”). One micro-turn—vial clearing—suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid yet selective; micro-setting (floating garden) constrains the final stillness. Sensory hierarchy aligns with Elias’s professional eye. Could edge higher if the terrace’s physics altered tactics more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira’s need for inner quiet—tightens via vial feedback and course correction. One meaningful deepening at the garden beat narrows options. Cost is legible but diffuse; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-comfort emerges organically through action and image; no moralizing. Final image reweights earlier motifs without statement. Subtext in gesture (Mira’s fidgeting) is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; perceptual signature is Elias’s calm precision. Dialogue sparse but natural, carrying subtext. No POV drift or register mismatch.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulting hush”) fits the lyric mode. One paraphrase loop (“silence… silence”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gondola-as-therapy, storm-glass as emotional mirror. Premise is specific; transformation test passes. Risk is moderate; could push further into world rules.</comment>
