<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and reverence for language are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the crystal, shallow breath). The interior contradiction—hope versus the weight of loss—surfaces in the moment he accepts the crystal’s death as the price for renewal. Motivation remains steady rather than intensifying, and the final renunciation feels slightly under-costed for the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clean; orientation is swift and atmospheric. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crystal’s final whisper reweights the stakes, and Elias’s walk toward the door crystallizes both gain and loss. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the cost (crystal’s exhaustion) is more asserted than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library’s suspended hush and dust-laden shelves are filtered through Elias’s selective attention; every sensory note (oak desk, dawn light) constrains his quiet ritual. The crystal itself functions as micro-setting, its diminishing resonance guiding the final beat. Spatial choreography is clear; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore fading language via the crystal—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as each decoded fragment drains the crystal, narrowing Elias’s options to “finish or abandon.” The final beat crystallizes the cost without external escalation; the tightening is internal and textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of linguistic fragility emerges through concrete action (decoding echoes) rather than statement. The crystal’s death as the price for renewal offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in Elias’s trembling hand and final whisper avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature; diction is restrained, scholarly, yet quietly lyrical (“weathered innocence,” “mausoleum of forgotten texts”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Rhythm modulates with the crystal’s faint pulses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and textured; sentences advance story or atmosphere without loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing,” “weathered innocence”) fits Elias’s scholarly lens. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The sonic-memory crystal and post-dictionary world feel freshly synthesized; the conceit is specific rather than gimmicky. Risk is moderate—quiet lyricism over spectacle—but the execution is confident. The ending’s conceptual reweighting avoids familiar templates.</comment>
