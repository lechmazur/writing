<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. reverent caretaker—are embodied in her micro-choices (planting, carving, confronting her shadow-self), but interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she felt the weight of it all”). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost: perpetual servitude in the orchard.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts her trammel with felt cost (“I’ll stay… until there’s nothing left of me”). Causal chain holds—tarot warning → confrontation → choice—under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: roots constrain planting, walls bear carved stories, half-lit glow tightens decisions. One slip: “air thick with earth and decay” repeats without new pressure. Setting constrains the final image—roots form the tarot pattern—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. service—tightens once when the shadow-self demands payment. Agency drives escalation: Elara’s choice to stay forecloses escape. Cost is legible on-page; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful turn suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of chosen bondage vs. imposed destiny emerges organically from Elara’s actions; no moralizing. The burned card’s reprise reweights meaning without exposition. Subtext in “destinies aren’t meant to be bartered” lands as Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent: “fiercely gentle precision,” “dusky with resolve.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“nexus where destinies were bartered”) slightly strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor loops: “thick with the scent of earth and decay” echoed later; “roots twisted unnaturally” repeats concept. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—soul-mending in a bone-orchard via narrative graft—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (shadow-self, tarot) are transformed through Elara’s specific labor. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
