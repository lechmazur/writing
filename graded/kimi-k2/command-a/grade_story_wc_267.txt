<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his stillness is embodied in micro-choices like hovering fingers over keys—but the “seraphically mundane” trait never constrains action; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more stated than felt on the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s first piano notes transform silence into “frostbitten hope,” foreclosing his prior role. Causal chain is tight—stain → door → bolt → knowledge → play—though the bolt’s agency could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress and snow are atmospheric but also functional: the cold seeps into Elias’s hesitation and the bolt’s gleam mirrors the ambient hue. The piano bench as micro-setting constrains his posture and choice, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cost of safety” versus “unpardonable silence”—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias touches the bolt. The escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal, but the price (bearing the fortress’s truth) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-fear emerges through concrete ritual and object; the final melody offers non-literal reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in the bolt’s transformation is effective, though the “frostbitten hope” line edges toward label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, ecclesiastical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s vocation of stillness. Syntax modulates with tension—long sentences for absorption, fragments for the bolt’s touch—without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“seraphically mundane,” “unpardonable silence”) risks register drift but stays within Elias’s meditative lexicon. Metaphors are spare and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The silent-choir bellhop is a fresh archetype; the bolt’s reincarnation as memory-key is an inventive pivot. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, but it pays off in the final image without gimmickry.</comment>
