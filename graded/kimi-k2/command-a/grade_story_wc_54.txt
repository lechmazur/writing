<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are embodied in tactile micro-choices—picking up the sextant, redirecting air and light—so motive stays visible. Interiority is concrete (“puzzle out new equations for hope”) but edges toward diagnostic label-speak, softening contradiction. The final renunciation (leaving the terminal with the sextant in pocket) carries a felt cost of letting the resurrected moment die again, earned by prior causality. Still, the emotional layering is thin; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s “illusion of movement” crystallizes hope’s equation while Eli accepts its impermanence. Causal chain (find artifact → experiment → resurrect → relinquish) holds under a Causal lens, each beat narrowing options. Orientation is anchored by 120 words. Cost is visible in the final image: dawn light exposes the terminal’s inevitable emptiness. Minor ellipsis between rigging speakers and dawn break is motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The terminal is rendered through selective sensory detail—cracked tiles, torn banners, redirected air—that constrains Eli’s tactics and supplies materials for resurrection. Micro-setting (the sextant’s brass gleam) doubles as charged object. Spatial choreography stays coherent; vents, mirrors, and speakers are tracked across moves. Environment subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting hope via the terminal—is signaled early and tightened once when Eli realizes the resurrection must be temporary. Agency drives escalation: each redirected flow is a choice that forecloses the fantasy of permanent revival. Cost is visible at dawn when the illusion must be abandoned. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of hope as engineered resurrection emerges organically from Eli’s concrete actions; no explicit moralizing. The sextant’s reprise in the final pocket reweights its meaning from navigation tool to internal compass. Subtext operates in the silence after the last echoing announcement. Complexity is present: hope is both created and relinquished.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains stable focalization; perceptual signature is precise, engineer-tinged (“redirected flows,” “structural integrity”). Rhythm modulates with task focus versus wonder. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Diction stays within intern’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; sentences advance scene or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“maze of intentions”). Minor elevated diction (“resurrect its purpose”) fits the elevated stakes. Final line lands with crystallized image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned spaceport as crucible for hope’s equation, sextant as metaphorical compass. Premise avoids cliché by grounding resurrection in tactile engineering acts. Specificity of carnival’s departure and dawn timing adds lived texture. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry.</comment>
