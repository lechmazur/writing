<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s kindness is embodied in micro-choices (calling Claire, adjusting melody), but her interiority drifts into therapeutic summary (“hymning the mundane”) rather than live contradiction; the decisive act is clear yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally stinging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: mother-daughter reconciliation reweights the broken vinyl’s meaning; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One soft patch—Claire’s arrival is compressed to “within hours,” a mild ellipsis that doesn’t rupture but slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The radiant haven is sketched with selective sensory cues (lavender-eucalyptus, soft glow) that mirror Elara’s calm; the broken vinyl on the sill catches light to charge the final image. Setting remains backdrop rather than active constraint, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mrs. Bennett’s need for a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and tightens when blood work confirms time is short. Escalation is single-note but sufficient: Elara’s agency narrows to summoning Claire; cost is visible in the mother’s frail whisper and Claire’s red eyes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciliation through small, ordinary gestures emerges organically from the broken vinyl and shared melody; final image of light on the fragment offers non-literal resonance. One soft moral overtone—“even fractured pieces hold beauty”—leans close to statement but stays within bounds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s profession; perceptual signature filters every detail through therapeutic attentiveness. Occasional elevated phrasing (“pulsing stillness”) risks poetic inflation yet remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely loop-free; rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Minor scaffold: “the scent of hope lingered in the air” appears twice with slight variation; one mixed metaphor (“thread of reconciliation”) nicks clarity but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice-reconciliation arc is refreshed by the vinyl fragment as tactile relic and the “hymning the mundane” conceit. Specificity of music therapy practice and the haven’s sensory palette lift it above template, though premise itself is not radically new.</comment>
