<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“gripped reality loosely”), but her contradictory impulses remain mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final shift to acceptance is signaled rather than earned through a visible micro-choice. The parasol’s symbolic weight is well-tracked, yet its role in her decision is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward endings crystallizes under the northern lights with felt cost (“weight lift”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of listening deepens until cadence shift—though the causal trigger for her change is more atmospheric than event-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina is rendered with tactile specificity (“jagged shards…like broken teeth”) and subtly guides choices—abandoned boats, creaking piers, northern lights—all constraining movement and mood. The parasol’s lace tip against the ice provides a micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learning the “sound of endings”—is signaled early and tightens through each survivor story; the final cadence shift reweights it from fear to acceptance. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, but the pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence emerges organically from setting, object, and survivor tales; the final image of the parasol catching auroras offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue (“Do you ever wonder…”) deepens the question rather than answering it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual bias—selective sensory detail, controlled psychic distance. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional figurative layering (“fold in patience”) edges toward overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph achieves charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “euthanasia tourist” premise is inverted—she seeks others’ endings, not her own—creating fresh moral territory. Specificity of drift-ice marina and parasol lace transforms familiar disaster-volunteer frame into a singular vision.</comment>
