<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “scheming pacifist” label is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory tactics; her interiority is calm exposition rather than embodied conflict. Kael’s resentment softens too smoothly—no micro-choice shows the cost of yielding. The cellular-memory shortcut bypasses visible struggle, muting character agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: broken pin → memory prompt → Kael’s “How do I start?” lands a Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of hardened stance). Orientation is immediate; closure is on-page and coherent under Causal lens. One minor slack: the sanctuary’s reappearance rule is told, not tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>“Soundless sanctuary” is sketched in two strokes—humming silence, marble fountain—enough to ground the scene. The music box serves as micro-setting and final image, but spatial choreography (distance between Elara and Kael) is vague. Environment does not actively constrain choices; it merely frames them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Kael release resentment?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once via the memory retrieval, but escalation is gentle; no tangible loss or irreversible trade-off is dramatized. The cost is emotional, not visible on the page, keeping it from the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “grace shifting” emerges through the broken pin’s reprise, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is present in Kael’s whispered question, but the concept is more stated via Elara’s dialogue than embodied through action. Resonant but not yet fully charged.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Elara; perceptual signature is calm, deliberate, consistent. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Kael’s diction shifts from scoffing to raw whisper, showing micro-change. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“cellular memory,” “conceptual repricing”) feels slightly academic for Elara’s voice but does not obscure clarity. Metaphors are controlled; no mixed imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The “sanctuary reappears when needed” premise freshens the therapy-room trope, and the broken music-box pin as grace-metaphor is specific. Yet the emotional arc remains familiar; risk-taking is modest. Fresh angle noted, but not transformative.</comment>
