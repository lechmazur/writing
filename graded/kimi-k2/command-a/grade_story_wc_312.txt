<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eliard feels earnest and imposes visible costs on the page, but the internal contradiction between cosmic drive and practical repair could be sharper in a single location. Emotion is embodied rather than labeled, though self-critical interiority edges toward diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal arc is clear—collecting, analysing, ringing—but the “because therefore” turns could be more compressed under 800 words. Closure lands with visible poetic reconfiguration (bitter ring bringing the first wave) under a lyrical lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct’s dripping spires are selected sensory anchors that constrain Eliard’s micro-tactics (scrubbing alloy, hanging bell). Dawn light becomes a functional resource, not just atmosphere, guiding final bell placement.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Escalation is tonal more than causal; the bell-for-a-wave exchange reweights the world’s balance but lacks secondary tightening moments within the shrinking word count. Agency is present yet cushioned.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Brittle devotion is dramatised through inheritance and choice, reconfiguring meaning when the cracked bell scars remain. Admirably avoids explicit moralising; final image shifts attention to the returning sea without platitude.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Compression serves lyric rhythm: “understanding dripping rates” is taught early and echoed in the bell’s cadence. No head-hopping; interior distinction remains intact under stress with spatial grounding in the viaduct.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean and variable, with purposeful syntactic calm around bell-mending then tighter, breathless clauses at the first wave. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats; density high without over­writing.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—ancient ringing rituals + aqua-balance science—feels specific yet overly consonant; risk is minimal. The unexpected miracle wave respects the pre-set rule absence of fish and ends on earned awe.</question>
