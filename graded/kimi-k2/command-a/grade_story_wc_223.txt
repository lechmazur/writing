<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied (“luminous absence within her”), but the shift from role-bound to self-owned feels more narrated than dramatized; the chessboard and walking pattern act as external mirrors rather than active crucibles. Kael’s benevolent ruthlessness is stated, not tested—no on-page cost or choice reveals the trait. The final “unbinding” is credible but leans on Kael’s pronouncement rather than a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the walking pattern crystallizes Elara’s new stance with felt cost (“no longer echoes of the past, but promises”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal leaps. One transition (shadow → etched floor) is seamless. Closure cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Gallery is evoked through echo, worn grooves, etched floor—selective sensory detail filtered by Elara’s listening bias. The chessboard and floor patterns function as micro-settings that constrain choice (missing pawns, spelled words). Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment evolves with the walking ritual, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to shed performed identity—is signaled early and tightened once via the walking ritual that reconfigures her stance. Agency is present but mild; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and interior. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “small gestures as history” emerges organically from Elara’s crisis-acting past and the spelled words. Subtext operates in the silent chessboard and the whispering echoes. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy resolution. Resonance lingers in the shift from echo to promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“A game without pawns”). Diction remains within plausible lexicon. No register drift or filter-verb clutter. Voice feels consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“nomadic penumbra”) are apt and not overused. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional beats. One minor paraphrase loop (“whispers followed her, no longer echoes…”) is negligible. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: crisis actor + whispering gallery + walking-spell ritual. Chessboard without pawns is a non-obvious metaphor for interregnum. Risk is moderate—lyric patterning could have collapsed into gimmick but holds. Specificity grounds the concept; not a template re-skin.</comment>
