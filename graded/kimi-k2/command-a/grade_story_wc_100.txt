<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s weary persistence and stubbornness are embodied in his tactile search for lens fragments; the final choice to hold the beacon aloft is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (his exhaustion lifts, the city’s voice is released). Interiority is concrete, but a few stock phrases (“second skin,” “quiet urgency”) dilute specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens’s glow reconfigures the city’s fate and Elias’s burden. Causal chain (package → lens hunt → reassembly → signal) holds; one minor ellipsis—how Elias breathes or moves underwater—doesn’t break the lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “the water above began to part.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drowned library is vivid, selective, and purposeful: warped shelves, algae waterfall, coral statue. These details constrain Elias’s search paths and charge the final image when the lens-light illuminates them. One brief spatial vagueness—“aisles choked with seaweed”—keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rest for the restless—tightens when Elias realizes the lens must be completed to send the city’s final signal. One meaningful deepening: each fragment found increases the moral weight. Cost is felt in bodily fatigue and the irreversible release of the city’s soul.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving rest emerges organically from Elias’s actions; the lens’s light becomes a non-literal answer to the city’s centuries of silence. Final image avoids moralizing, but a touch of abstract phrasing (“give rest a permanent address”) nudges it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and aligned with Elias’s profession: “undertaker,” “unburyable,” “rest a permanent address.” Sensory hierarchy reflects his priorities—books, bones, light. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; minor cadence repetition in “he had come here… he had spent…” slightly dulls rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor (“weariness lifting like a tide receding”) and a few scaffold phrases (“for the first time in centuries”) keep it from 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker in drowned library restoring a beacon for the already-dead. Tropes (lost city, broken lens) are transformed through Elias’s vocation and the underwater graveyard. Specificity of “seaweed-green leather” and coral-encrusted statue anchors originality.</comment>
