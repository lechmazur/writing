<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character traits—rebellion, poetic drive, longing for refracted forgiveness—are consistently rendered through embodied actions (brushing stone, poetry improvisation). Interiority, however, edges toward abstract declaration: “I am the shattered mirror” crystallizes choice but feels spoken rather than struggled-with. Final cost (a shard of heart surrendered) is declared more than dramatized, blunting legibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: lyric refrains accumulate, mist thickens, light refracts into shadow-figures, each layer tightening moral stakes without traditional causal twists. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: Lira’s renunciation—surrender of a heart-shard to carry a refracted truth—reads as decisive, with cosmic weight signaled by the dissolving shadows. Orientation is clear within 120 words; one transition between tower interior and spire surface is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Towers of bone” and “canyon of endless echoes” create tactile, reverberant space that literally constrains movement—the whisper walls physically absorb sound, forcing lyrical speech as the only viable tactic. Mist, spire, and refracted light evolve as dynamic environmental actors rather than backdrop. Bone towers become echo chambers that reshape poetry into magic; no cap applied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—obtain a new shape of forgiveness through mystical refraction—tightens once when spire offers the trade (a literal heart-shard). Agency is enacted via poetic recitation that intensifies until light manifests; causality stays internal and lyrical rather than external-plot driven, sufficient for micro-turn. Cost is declared rather than viscerally felt, capping escalation below 8.7.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness as shattered, recollectible reflection emerges from refractive imagery, not authorial lecture. Final image—the dissolved shadows—offers resonant reconfiguration: forgiveness is not obtained but continually re-framed. Subtext avoids neat moral by leaving the carried shard’s ache present yet abstract; no final thematic statement intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Lyric third-person limited voice is sustained, rich with textured syntax: “mist swirled faster now... echoes grew louder.” Selective sensory detail (“pale, otherworldly light,” “colors of silver and blue”) is filtered through Lira’s awestruck perception. No dialogue appears; voice coherence remains high. Overwritten beats during climax (“the spire’s light intensified, enveloping...”) flirt with purple but stay tolerable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Prose is mostly vivid and propulsive, though several consecutive sentences open with stock participle or pronoun echo loops (“her fingers brushing,” “her heart pounding”). One mixed metaphor of “forgiveness reshaped into something she could carry” slightly muddles cause/cost. No loop or scaffold touches the final image; rhythm accelerates smoothly at climax without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Forgiveness rendered through a metaphysical prism is a fresh angle; the bone canyon, echoes as auditory mirror, and spire as truth-lens feel organically fused. No overt derivative tropes; synthesis of Gothic decay + light-bending magic lands as singular vision. Some imagery borders archetype (“shard of heart”) but is personalized through Lira’s lyric voice. Keeps high originality without self-indulgent experiment.</comment>
