<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—cool flake against skin, lilac unease—but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation (“courage to stand in the mess”) is felt yet not fully foreclosed by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mandala dissolves, flake fades, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with cost (“lilac unease remained…a guide”). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early via tile flake and mandala, final image reweights silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Grotto’s mist and tiles constrain perception and choice; the tile flake functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful—damp stone, thickened mist—guiding Elara’s tactile discovery and the emergent hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover meaning in chaos—is signaled early and tightens through mandala’s transformation; one deepening beat when the hand shape emerges. Cost is felt but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of meaning created through listening to silence emerges organically from Elara’s embodied choices; final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the hush and tile flake resonates without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—whispering grotto, lilac unease—maintains consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue; prose rhythm modulates with pressure, avoiding filter verbs. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; occasional ornamental phrasing (“mist clung…reluctant lover”) slightly dilutes peak beats. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor register drift in “emergent hush” label.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of chalk artist, mandala, and collective silence; avoids stock tropes. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without these particulars.</comment>
