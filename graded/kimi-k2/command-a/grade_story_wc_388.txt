<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is present but filtered through summary “story-teller” lenses (“intuition kicked into overdrive”). Her embodied reactions are briefly sketched; contradiction surfaces only in the final choice—preserve vs expose—yet feels reported rather than sweat-staked. We learn traits through efficient exposition, but no micro-choice under live pressure reveals a hierarchy of values beyond abstract resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens maintained: discovery → new information → containment attempt. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: the orchard survives, but the dust returns, the diamond is sealed—felt cost is the eternal vigil she accepts. All causality is on-page; information never teleports. Slight hand-wave: her ability to chant a seal without prior set-up gives a pinch of late convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Glimpsed details—“cracked earth,” “radioactive dust storms,” the diamond’s eerie glow—are selective, sensorial, charged. Crucially, the orchard’s stillness then the returning wind constrain her choice; the diamond’s flaw literalizes the seal. One coherent environment filters through Elara’s biases and ultimately limits her tactics—meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth versus orchard life—is clear from the second paragraph. Escalation tightens when the letters reveal the prison, forcing an active containment ritual. Visible price: stillpoint survives but requires eternal watch—stakes reweighted. A single meaningful turn is sufficient for word count, though pressure is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</question>
<comment>Truth vs comfortable lies theme is intelligible, threaded through the literal letters. Its resonance lies in accepting an unsatisfying balance (truth + endless vigil) rather than a moral slogan. Subtext, however, edges toward explicit (“she had excavated the truth, but at a cost”), slightly lowering authority by undercutting reader intuition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question>
<comment>Voice is tidy, sometimes elegant (“radioactive dust storms that swept the horizon”), but it remains functional, not memorably textured. No dialogue, so compression is by narrative summary; free indirect style glimmers yet often retreats to reportage. POV discipline is tight: no head-hop, no author intrusion beyond the closing nudge cited in Q5.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive—no syntactic repetition, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence advances stakes, image, or both. Rhythm fluctuates with scene intensity. Minus microscopic drift: “sharply observant mind … kicked into overdrive” skirts template phrasing, yet clarity remains unmarred.</comment>

<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Core synthesis—post-apocalyptic Eden powered by a diamond seal—leans fresh through execution of containment rather than exploitation twist. Specific texture (shredded letters reassembled into a living spell) lifts it above trope recycling. It avoids neat symmetry, ending in unresolved vigilance, but the premise still echoes familiar post-apoc “oasis trap” motifs without a wholly non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
