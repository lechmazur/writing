<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her grip on the meteorite, her humming to pigeons—but the reinvention of history remains abstract; no single on-page lie is risked or exposed, blunting the cost of her final honesty. The blooming/withering metaphor is repeated rather than dramatized in body or choice. Still, her micro-choice to map dust instead of flee shows a clear value hierarchy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, meteorite weight, and pigeon wings layer until the final image reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s closed-eye listening crystallizes a new stance with felt cost (“she had preserved herself”). Orientation is swift; no causal gaps. One minor slip: the anonymous letter arrives with no prior constraint on pigeon precision, a light coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic’s must, slanted light, and pigeon flutter are selective and purposeful, guiding her bodily movements and narrowing perception under pressure. The meteorite chip functions as micro-setting, its weight constraining her grip and charging the final image. Sensory detail never stalls momentum; every scent or shaft of light is filtered through Elara’s immediate goal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost songs—tightens through accumulating texture: dust becomes map, pigeons become carriers of melody. One meaningful deepening: the realization that “the songs are in the dust” reweights all prior mapping. Cost is conceptual (exposure of her false histories) yet remains slightly abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation vs. reinvention, the ethics of self-mythology. Subtext lives in gesture—her thumb rubbing the meteorite while rewriting memories. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer: the dust’s song is both external reality and internal truth, reweighted without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s obsessive focus. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—dust motes are “chaotic patterns” only until she learns to read them. Compression (“she had long since buried”) is strategic and taught early. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) edges toward register drift but stays within lyric tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops. Figurative language is purposeful: “paper trail of half-truths” threads plot and theme. One mixed metaphor—“ground her in a universe that felt increasingly alien”—slightly blurs physical logic, but clarity holds. Final paragraph breathes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Pigeon courier + dust cartography + Mars meteorite forms a fresh constellation; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lost childhood songs, attic sanctuary) are transformed through tactile specificity. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold structural gamble—but the emotional specificity is memorable.</comment>
