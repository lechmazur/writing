<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and “receptive” trait are shown through ritualistic planting and obsessive study, but interiority stays general; the final step into the chamber is a choice without visible cost or contradiction, so the arc feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain—seed → key → door—lands cleanly with a decisive change (discovery of chamber), yet the cost is conceptual rather than felt; the lens holds but closure lacks palpable price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Brook, moonlit soil, and glowing key are vivid and selective; the brook finally parts to reveal the door, so setting constrains the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes (safeguard the haven, solve the enigma) are signaled early and tighten when the key appears; however, escalation is mostly atmospheric—no concrete trade-off or loss is dramatized before the door opens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of innovation versus guardianship emerges through Elias’s ritual and the chamber of unsolved seeds; subtext is present but leans on symbolic objects rather than character contradiction, so resonance is moderate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is stable, with tactile diction (“storm-born silence,” “cool against his skin”) and rhythmic control; occasional elevated phrasing (“orthogonal approaches”) slightly jars but remains consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in “weight beyond its fragile shell” and “storm-born silence” nudges it below 9-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Corpse-flower seed as puzzle catalyst and glowing key as portal opener transform familiar tropes; the synthesis feels fresh, though the chamber reveal edges toward magical convenience.</comment>
