<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the driftwood nostalgia—but the “rhythm of repair” remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost is more atmospheric than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hall of mirrors reweights her purpose and the ticking clock ratifies it. Causal chain is thin—symbols align rather than force choices—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the final image carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen library is tactile—frosted windows, aged parchment—and the hall of mirrors constrains her exit, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the mirrors force a stance crystallization. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, but the deepening is legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges through the mirrors’ reflections and the gear’s hum; no moralizing. Final image reweights prior material without statement, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices locks, gears, ticking. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; compression and elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“hauntingly bright”) fits the lyric mode. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—frozen library, mirrors, time gears—are transformed through Elara’s specific vocation and the quiet reconfiguration of repair. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
