<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Elara’s grief feels embodied (hands tracing wood, deliberate tea pour), but her interior stays mostly smooth. One sharp moment—“knew she had contained not just his memory, but her own resilience” finally ties trait to cost, yet most contradiction arrives paraphrased, not dramatized scene-by-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the finished carving crystallizes her stance—“the here and gone of life itself”—with felt cost. Lens tilts Accumulative/Textural: pressure thickens through wood-grain, steam, and mane-strand density until stance locks.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Setting condenses to “rain-beaded skylight” and “metal bucket catching drips”—micro-details that echo internal drip/surrender. Tools array mirrors the choice to cut a path; weather diffuses light just enough to refract memory. Vivid, selective, purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single stake: can she carve loss into form? Pressure intensifies with each curling shavings-chip; final pass of blade forecloses retreat, leaving smooth ash-lion as irreversible choice. Agency sustained, cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Themes of impermanence and reclamation emerge through concrete particulars—kettle steam, wood grain, mane—never abstract assertion. Closing realization reframes grief as not storage but transformation; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice stays consistent, slightly elevated third-person lyrical that fits grief-struck reverie. Sensory triads and controlled metaphor (“steam curled… distorting light”) vary rhythm; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose mostly spare and musical, only two soft spots—“rust-hued peace” edges decorative, “here and gone” repeated without new traction. Elsewhere, density high and clarity intact through final shavings line.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</comment>
<comment>Freshness lies in using lion-tamer’s craft as inverse grief-practice: tamer’s life becomes widow’s art. Conventional trope (grief sculpture) made new through occupational specificity—ash wood, cage logic, predator rest—without gimmickry.</comment>
