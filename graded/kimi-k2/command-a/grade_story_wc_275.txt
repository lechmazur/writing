<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism is stated early and revisited when she accepts the blade, but the interior contradiction between belief and necessity is summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final smile feels unearned because the cost of holding the weapon is never embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise (she stands with blade sheathed, life blooming behind her), but the lens drifts from Causal to Accumulative/Textural without teaching the shift; the warning from Kael sets up stakes that are never tested on the page, so the “before/after” is more mood than consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert beyond are vividly sketched and the “quiet”-engraved scrap functions as micro-setting, but the farm never actively constrains choice or supplies resources that alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protect the farm—is clear, yet pressure plateaus after Kael’s warning; no on-page incursion or resource loss forces a trade-off, so escalation is declared rather than dramatized. The blade’s acceptance is a micro-turn but carries no immediate cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“Continuity through chaos” emerges organically from Elara’s gardening and the roses’ persistence, but the final smile edges toward thematic summary; the resonance is present yet blunted by the untested threat and the pacifist’s painless victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensory filter; diction is restrained, tactile, and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but natural, though Kael’s voice is indistinct from the narrative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft fillers (“she often paused to trace the letters”) could be trimmed, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the flow. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The pacist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter premise is familiar, yet the desert-rose sanctuary and the repurposed airship scrap give it fresh texture; the story avoids clichéd shootouts but also avoids any surprising reconfiguration of the trope.</comment>
