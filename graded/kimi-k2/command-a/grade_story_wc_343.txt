<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing the dog-ear, muttering half-translations—yet her interiority drifts into stock phrases (“sociable isolation,” “diligently curious spirit”) that flatten contradiction. The final smile and echo of Thorne’s voice provide earned stasis, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally staked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the map reweights the premise, and “Persevera” crystallizes the new stance. Causal chain is clean—hopscotch board → beam → hatch → map—though the vanishing Captain is an off-stage convenience that slightly dilutes motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The brass hull, starling murmurations, and crystalline orbs are vivid and selective; the hopscotch board itself becomes micro-setting that constrains decoding choices. Final image of starlings forming a compass rose recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting the next discovery—tightens once when the hopscotch board activates and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: Elara descends alone into cold darkness, trading safety for knowledge. Pressure is coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of perseverance through curiosity emerges organically from Elara’s choices; the phrasebook’s “Persevera” reweights from mentor echo to self-command. Subtext avoids moralizing, but the final line’s platitude (“greatest discoveries are made…”) edges toward thematic echo, tempering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices brass gleam, frayed edges, rhythmic starlings. Syntax modulates with tension, and no POV slippage occurs. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal glow,” “crystalline orbs”) slightly overshoots apprentice register but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with strong verbs and sensory specificity; only minor loops (“light’s path, eternal glow” restated) and one mixed metaphor (“stranded luminance… suspended in crystalline orbs”) mar momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The hopscotch-board-as-compass and starling-murmuration compass rose offer fresh, grounded twists on familiar quest tropes. Synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk lies in lyrical compression rather than structural gimmickry.</comment>
