<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows tactile reactions (trembling fingers) and immediate sensory tuning, but the shift from inherited duty to joyful purpose lacks micro-evidence prior to the closure epiphany. The burden is declared rather than embodied through hard choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure gives a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: final image of walls choosing her re-prices the premise from “map dreams” to “honor memory.” Under Accumulative lens, pattern builds mirror → film negative → diaries → mirror payoff. Cost is on-page: film left on pedestal symbolizes forfeiture of earlier goals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Passage itself becomes a felt character; ivy constrains movement and fireplace yields diaries—setting alters tactics and decision chain. Sensory density is selective (breathing walls, humid air) without tourist overload. Meets 9+ gate: walls/fireplace directly constrain retrieval of diaries and key.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“learn what walls dream”—stay singular; tightening occurs when discovery narrows from mapping to memorializing. Price is the forfeiture of lifelong quest tool (film) on the pedestal, legible on page, though causal pressure from walls remains lightly external, lowering top-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as ethical inheritance emerges through accreted objects, not authorial commentary. Final mirror provides non-literal answer: walls seek to be remembered by the one willing to archive their loss. Avoids moral tag, though “walls chose her” comes close to thesis-statement.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush but disciplined; perceptual signature (“moss-covered breathing walls”) underlines inherited synesthetic talent. Small rhythmic slips—“walls seemed to pulse, their dreams now…” stacks filter verbs at a peak beat—pull just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose sings without clutter; one paraphrase loop (“walls seemed to close in, their dreams growing louder”) rehashes earlier image within three lines. Otherwise precise; density, metaphor, and syntax acceleration mesh smoothly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes “cartographer of invisible memory” into fresh fable; mirror-as-window twist arrives inevitable in retrospect yet unguessable. Transformation test holds; story would collapse if walls merely dreamed of “repair,” so specificity anchors originality.</comment>
