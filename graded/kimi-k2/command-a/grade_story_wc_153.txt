<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory pull between fear and need to heal is palpable. Her micro-choice to break the seal on her own unsent letter crystallizes the arc with visible cost. Backstory is woven tightly through present cues and alters tactics. Only a slight drift toward therapeutic self-diagnosis in “she had once been like the spirits here” keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dull warmth and the letter’s release reweight the entire journey. Causal linkage holds—each beat (shard hum → condensation map → pedestal letter) tightens options. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. The final image carries undeniable emotional cost without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mangrove’s shifting roots and singing spirits function as micro-setting that actively guides Elara’s path and mood. Sensory selection narrows under crisis: “air thick with anticipation” just before the letter appears. The shard itself becomes an intimate setting object that constrains the final choice. Only the hut’s interior remains slightly white-room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing the unspoken apology—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each beat. The moment of breaking the seal is a decisive tightening that forecloses avoidance. Cost is felt in the shard’s loss of glow and the spirits’ silence. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges from concrete events: condensation messages, the sealed letter, the shard’s dimming. No moralizing; the final “bridge” image reweights prior material without statement. Subtext in “fierce tenderness” carries the emotional aftereffect. Complexity lingers—apology is seed, not harvest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s bias (“roots twisted like ancient fingers”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the climax. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. Occasional elevated diction (“evoke what had been buried”) slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful (“moonlight pooled like liquid silver”). One mixed metaphor—“shard’s jagged edge cutting through fog”—is minor. High information density; every sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The unsent-letter labyrinth with singing spirits is a fresh synthesis; the shard as key to condensation messages is non-obvious yet inevitable. Tropes of magical objects and regret are transformed through Elara’s specific interior stakes. Risky lyricism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
