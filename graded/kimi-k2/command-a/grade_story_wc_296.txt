<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eira’s interior contradiction—warlike serenity masking self-loathing—drives every beat; the seed’s glow forcing “I failed” is earned by prior guilt. Embodied emotion (hands clenched, boots sinking) is specific, though “warlike serenity” itself edges label-speak. Micro-choice to unbend in the vortex visibly costs her guarded stance, creating Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the plant stabilizes the vortex and Eira’s self-image simultaneously, cost paid in the whispered confession. Causal lens holds—each circle tightens because the vortex demands surrender. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. One transition (stepping into vortex) is within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard-vortex is tactile—moss under boots, currents tugging cloak—and constrains her movement to expanding circles. Sensory hierarchy favors cold, scent of rot, then glow, all filtered through Eira’s urgent focus. Final image of crisp air recharges the healed lake as living setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is tested by escalating vortex chaos; each circle deepens the cost of surrender. Tightening is singular but sufficient: unbending forecloses her lifelong self-shielding. Price is the spoken confession and permanent shift from shield to resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden truth emerges from seed-as-mirror and confession; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “quiet resolve” reweights earlier “warlike serenity” without stating a lesson. Subtext in “mirrors could never reveal” invites reader reflection on self-deception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Eira’s perceptions; diction (“shimmered with an otherworldly glow”) fits druidic register. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for memory shards, clipped phrases under vortex pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive; only minor scaffold (“the seed was more than a tool—it was a key”) could be trimmed. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop (“swirling orchard vortex… swirling currents”) but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Flesh-eating plant as healing agent is fresh inversion; vortex-orchard merges decay and fruit in one charged space. Specificity of “frozen confession” as both lake and self-guilt feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky serenity-to-vulnerability shift lands without gimmickry.</comment>
