<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing symbols, clutching the whistle—but interiority drifts into summary (“her resolve unyielding”) rather than contradictory impulse. Mentor absence is backstory, not crucible; no second character on page. Final acceptance of task is credible renunciation yet cost is more stated than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living shell reweights the city’s doom and Elara’s mission. Causal chain (pattern language → crack → chamber → mandate) holds under Causal lens. One transition (surface to tunnel) is clean. Cost is conceptual—knowledge of impending collapse—rather than immediate personal loss, slightly softening impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>City-on-turtles premise is vivid, selective, and immediately constrains stakes (“shells cracking under weight”). Sensory hierarchy skews visual; tactile detail surfaces once inside tunnel. Micro-setting (spiral tunnel) guides choice. Final image of mapping turtle interiors re-uses setting to charge next phase.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city’s survival—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: gate closed → tunnel opens → mandate issued. Agency is Elara’s decision to descend and accept task; cost is deferred, not yet visceral. Pressure coherent under Causal lens; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of pattern vs. silence emerges organically; watchers’ silence reweighted from menace to witness. No moralizing; final image invites reflection on inevitable collapse. Subtext carried by shifting shell imagery. Complexity acknowledged without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s cartographer perception (“language of patterns”). No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“sunwashed dread”) risks register drift but remains coherent. Rhythm modulates with descent into tunnel.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; few loops. Figurative language disciplined except one mixed moment (“air thickened with dread”). High information density; sentences advance plot or atmosphere. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Turtle-metropolis premise is fresh yet inevitable; pattern-language as key device deepens rather than ornaments. Mentor-vanish trope is transformed into living shell revelation. Specificity of cartographer tools and spiral tunnels anchors originality. Risky scale handled without exposition dump.</comment>
