<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her obsession with the postcards, the tactile memory of “fingertips still stained with phosphorescent paint”—but the story withholds any contradictory impulse or visible cost until the final paragraph, so the renunciation feels foreshadowed rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s decision to hide the postcards re-weights the premise, and the cost is felt in her stained fingers and the pavilion’s winter sleep. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layer of pigment and secrecy tightens the pattern—though the causal chain from postcard instruction to mural completion is more lyrical than rigorously linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion’s copper roof, resin-scented air, and snow-muffled dusk are selective and purposeful; the setting’s luminescent paint and hidden panels literally constrain how and when the murals can be seen, charging the final image of “summer and darkness in equal measure.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the flowers bloom at night—escalates through each layer of paint and secrecy, culminating in the realization that the murals must remain hidden. The tightening is lyrical rather than sharply causal, but the cost (renouncing daylight recognition) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: hidden beauty demands shadow, and art survives through quiet transmission. The final image of “tenderness of hidden things” offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though the concept flirts with abstraction in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a hushed, painterly cadence—“the dawning hush between seasons wrapped around everything, soft as petals”—that remains consistent and character-specific. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense and rhythmic, each doing multiple jobs; occasional stacked metaphors (“summer and darkness in equal measure”) risk overwriting but stay within the lyrical register. No loops or scaffold artifacts mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—postcards as generational instructions for secret nocturnal art—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of botanical lore, sacred architecture, and phosphorescent paint is specific and memorable, though the risk is modest.</comment>
