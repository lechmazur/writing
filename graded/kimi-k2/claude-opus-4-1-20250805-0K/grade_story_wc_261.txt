<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is textured—her contradictory urge to reopen wounds while seeking healing is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing coffee ring, pressing scarred palm to glass). Motivation intensifies from passive decoding to active invitation, culminating in the earned renunciation of closure. The cost—perpetual openness as invitation—is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scars, rings, hourglass grains accumulate until the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “ready to begin again” crystallizes the stance of remaining open. Cost is legible—she accepts endless susceptibility. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The tower’s dawn light, hourglass sand, and rooftop garden vines are selective and filtered through Maya’s plant-telepathy. The coffee ring and scarred glass function as micro-settings that constrain her reading method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; environment evolves with her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to relate to one’s own woundedness—tightens from decoding scars to choosing perpetual openness. One deepening beat: realizing the miracle has become ambient shifts her goal from recovery to invitation. Cost is the felt vulnerability of never closing. Agency drives the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wounds as portals, not records. Subtext operates in the shift from “libraries written in collagen” to “channels through which wonder might travel.” Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity is preserved—openness is both gift and wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is plant-tinged synesthesia (“chlorophyll dreams”). Syntax modulates with rising clarity post-anesthesia. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Compression is taught early and paid off in the final turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“frosted hourglass turned for the last time” echoes closure). No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors anesthesia fade and dawning clarity. Clean grammar; no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy with grieving plants + microscopic scar tunnels + dispersed miracle = non-obvious angle on healing. Transformation test fails if names change; specificity is integral. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in charged final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
