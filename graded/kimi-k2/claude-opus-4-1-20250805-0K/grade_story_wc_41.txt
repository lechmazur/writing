<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ezra’s amnesiac-prophet condition is embodied through ritual chalk and driftwood, but the woman’s motives remain functional rather than crucible-tested; the final renunciation (Ezra accepts perpetual forgetting) is earned and carries visible cost in the closing image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woman’s discovery reweights Ezra’s curse into a kindness, with the chalk prophecy “Tomorrow you will remember having helped her today” crystallizing the cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of forgetting/remembering tightens through repetition rather than causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog sculptures, broken televisions, and chalked driftwood form a tactile micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the static source; the garden’s breathing mist charges the final image of “tidal longing” as both setting and metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the sound of aging—tightens when the grandmother’s voice is located; cost is the woman’s tears and Ezra’s eternal loop, but escalation is more accumulative than sharply reversive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-decay emerges from the grandmother’s counting voice and Ezra’s chalked prophecies; no moralizing, only the resonant image of “chalk growing smaller… like years” reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, controlled third-person hovers close to Ezra’s selective perception; diction (“vapor forms dissolving like memories”) is character-bound, rhythm modulates with fog pulses, and no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors serve atmosphere without clutter, no loops or scaffold, and the final sentence earns its cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Amnesiac-prophet tending fog sculptures to harvest degraded birthday tapes is a fresh synthesis; the chalked labyrinth repurposed as kindness rather than curse feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
