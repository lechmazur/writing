<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid—her fingers tracing the Apollo-X patch, the lie to her supervisor—but the final self-archiving choice arrives with only inherited, not freshly dramatized, contradiction; the cost is implied rather than embodied in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “We’re not missing. We’re archived” reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density tightens until Lila steps into the same recursion—though the final beat compresses the decisive change into a single sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The archive’s “towers of obsolete servers” and the maintenance elevator anchor space early; the Apollo-X patch returns in the final image to charge the transformation. Micro-setting (the jacket against her chest) constrains the last choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding the vanished—tightens when Lila deciphers the coordinate-recipe and realizes deletion is a form of capture. One clear escalation: she chooses to become Pattern User 8625, foreclosing escape with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the recursive metaphor: digital ghosts are not erased but compressed into a living archive. The final line—“they go home”—offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights every prior deletion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, data-archaeologist idiom (“cached databases,” “backup substrata”) without jargon overload. Compression and patterned elision (“sensed absence”) are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers new information or texture. Occasional lyrical lifts (“echo of forgotten songs”) are earned and brief; no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cold-case mystery with recursive digital afterlife feels inevitable yet fresh; the Apollo-X emergency frequency threading through SocialSync’s metadata is a non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
