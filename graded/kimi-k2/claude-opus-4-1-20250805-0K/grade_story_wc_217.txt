<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the feather’s broken shaft and her “tend” action crystallize her values. The boy’s presence supplies relational pressure that forces her to act, altering both their stances. The final micro-choice—helping him re-weave the kite—earns its cost by the prior seven-year solitude. Minor slip: “learning to harmonize” drifts toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, clear causal lens: storm → found feather → kite snaps → shared mending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira accepts ongoing incompleteness while actively mending the boy’s kite, cost legible in her relinquished solitude. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon, wet sand, and torn kite paper constrain movement and supply tactile stakes. The drake feather recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image when tucked behind her ear. Weather shift from pewter to hammered gold mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can beauty be found in the incomplete? Pressure tightens when the kite snaps—loss made visceral. Mira’s agency drives the single meaningful turn: she chooses engagement over retreat, cost shown in shared labor. No coincidence resolves; escalation remains causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts—mending torn paper, re-weaving broken poems—never stated. Final image of fragments sparkling in dawn light offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the kite’s “new patterns of light” reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “rainwater still trickling from mangrove roots in diminishing whispers.” POV remains tightly focalized through Mira; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but natural (“It’s ruined” / “Look”) and advances plot. Voice modulates with storm-to-calm arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language disciplined. Minor elevated diction (“liminal space”) fits reflective beat. Final line achieves crystalline closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “broken becomes beautiful” arc is refreshed through tactile lagoon ecology and the drake feather’s iridescence. Specificity of “cobalt lagoon after rain” anchors universals. Risk taken in quiet lyric mode pays off; no gimmicks.</comment>
