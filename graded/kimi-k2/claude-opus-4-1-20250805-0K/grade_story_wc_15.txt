<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calla’s contradictory impulses—grief for the drowned world vs. compulsion to weave new hope—are embodied in her sleepwalking stitching, but the interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“the labyrinth remembered everything”) rather than concrete stakes-driven tension. The final smile and surrender to drowsiness registers as earned stasis, yet the cost feels generalized rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the illustration’s children dance on stone, reweighting ruin into reverence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stitched overlap tightens the spiral toward this charged poise. Cost is conceptual (permanence of loss) rather than sharply felt, but the pattern is legible and coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The red canyon walls, barnacled petroglyphs, and tide-pools constrain every step; the illustration plate itself becomes micro-setting that guides the needle. Sensory specificity (“color of dried blood and hope”) is selective and purposeful, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transforming drowned ruin into living myth—is signaled early and escalates through each stitched overlap. The tightening occurs when the children leave the plate and animate the stone, foreclosing nostalgia and crystallizing new possibility; the cost is the irreversibility of the old world’s death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creation from catastrophe, reverence without restoration. The final image of painted children “permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide” offers non-literal resonance; no moralizing intrudes. Subtext operates through gesture and silence—no one speaks, yet the walls “laugh” in unheard frequencies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“stubborn succulents that now bloomed in salt-crusted crevices”) that modulates under pressure. POV remains tightly focalized through Calla’s somnolent perception; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—threads, tides, pigments—anchors every sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“ocean kissed desert”). Occasional elevated diction (“reverence,” “precedents”) fits the poet-narrator’s lexicon. Final cadence slows into breath without slackening tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—tidal sanctuary in desert canyon, sleepwalking weaver who stitches futures—synthesizes climate grief and mythopoesis in a fresh, inevitable way. Risky lyric structure pays off: the spiral pattern taught early becomes the closure image. No derivative echoes; specificity makes ruin luminous.</comment>
