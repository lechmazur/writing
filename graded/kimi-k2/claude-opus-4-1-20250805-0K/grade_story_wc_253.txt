<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—"flat as pressed paper," "hollow it out from inside until it could float." Performer's blank affect is consistent and purposeful; Mrs. Chen’s micro-choice to touch the brittle petal crystallizes the shift. Moral ambiguity is dramatized, not labeled. Cost is felt in the crumbling petal and the promise of tomorrow’s lesson.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wooden bird among dried flowers reconfigures grief without resolving it. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each whittled curl adds density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the petal’s dust and the mandate’s ongoing threat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbines, basswood shavings, and brittle petals are vivid and selective. Turbine shadows act as clock hands, constraining the scene’s temporal pressure. Micro-setting (the table, the bouquet) functions as crucible. Final image of bird among flowers is charged by prior sensory layering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry grief under the mandate—is signaled early and tightened through each narrated slice. Escalation is accretive: each curl of wood removes emotional weight until the final reconfiguration. No external reversals, but the deepening is palpable. Cost is the crumbling petal and the endurance of void.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mandated joy and authentic sorrow, crystallized in the wooden bird’s impossible lightness. Subtext lives in the performer’s monotone and Mrs. Chen’s silent reach. Final image offers non-literal answer: lightness as resistance, not forgetting. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—clinical, ritualized, yet haunted. Syntax mirrors the performer's detachment: flat declaratives, precise tool names, no emotional leakage. Free indirect style stays clean; no POV drift. Rhythm tightens under pressure, then releases into Mrs. Chen’s tentative narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and textured: “whisper-roar,” “brittle as old laws.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are fresh and integrated. Final cadence—“Now I am becoming lighter”—earns its lift through prior accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—illegal grief processed via emotionless narration of mundane acts—is fresh and fully committed. Turbines as mechanical mantra vs. human hush is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky tonal void pays off in the final reconfiguration. Transformation test: story collapses without this exact method and setting.</comment>
