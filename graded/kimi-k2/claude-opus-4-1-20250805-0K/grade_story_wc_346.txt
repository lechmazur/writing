<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his recognition of the cracked puppet as a map of his own suffering is embodied and specific. The transfer of the “burden” from Eliza to Marcus is dramatized through touch and song, not summary. Cost is felt: he relinquishes purely mechanical adjustment for a gentler, riskier lullaby. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse becomes an instrument of tenderness, the clock’s hands move backward for the first time, and Marcus’s role is permanently altered. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each nested pattern (cracks, lullaby, light) reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is anchored early by the spiral stairs and Atlantic edge. No lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse, puppet head, and lens apparatus function as micro-setting that constrains Marcus’s final action: the cracked porcelain must be placed in the lens to refract the lullaby. Dusk’s “bruised plum and copper” hues mirror internal bruising; the pane of hush is a tangible silence that affects tactics. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The setting charges the final image without ever stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how gently humanity meets its end—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Marcus chooses song over math. One decisive deepening: the puppet reveals Eliza’s prior burden, forcing Marcus to adopt a riskier method. Cost is visible—his untrained voice cracks, the lighthouse beam re-ignites only through his flawed effort. Agency remains causal under the lyric-accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the cracked porcelain and broken song: beauty in fracture, tenderness in inevitable ending. Subtext lives in gesture—Marcus pressing his ear to the puppet’s whisper—never in exposition. The final lullaby reweights every prior image without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on how care persists inside catastrophe; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “the Atlantic dissolved into something older than oceans” is both lyrical and character-bound. Compression is taught early (“nested patterns,” “pane of hush”) and paid off in the final refraction. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) is justified by the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “light gathered in its cracks, refracted and multiplied” does triple duty—image, theme, plot. Rhythm modulates from long, bruised sentences to the staccato of ascent. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold—“beautifully flawed” appears twice within four lines—does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum clock-adjusting and lullaby-singing is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The cracked puppet as both map and conductor transforms a familiar apocalypse trope into intimate caretaking. Risk—ending on a whispered song rather than spectacle—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of the lighthouse lens and porcelain veins anchors universals.</comment>
