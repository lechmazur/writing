<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaspar’s guilt and self-forgiveness arc is embodied through tactile micro-choices (copper pieces, thread-pulling) and culminates in a credible renunciation. Interiority is specific, avoiding therapy-speak, though the “teacher who had done his best” line edges toward summary. The cost—accepting imperfect teaching—lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaspar’s self-forgiveness reweights the frozen game and his future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tapestry adjustment layers meaning until the final copper piece crystallizes the shift. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth are vivid, selective, and constrain Kaspar’s choices—he cannot unfreeze the villagers, only re-pattern the tapestry. The copper piece at the end recharges the setting as both offering and exit. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens as Kaspar decodes the tapestry and sees his own flawed teaching mirrored. One meaningful deepening: realizing guilt serves no one. Cost is the irreversible frozen state and his relinquishment of redemption fantasy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: teaching as imperfect sacrifice. The tapestry’s re-patterning and the copper offering provide non-literal resonance without moralizing. Final image of suspended thunder crystallizes the cost of unending regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with tactile diction (“winnow,” “pewter sky”) and rhythmic control. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—chess logic applied to grief—is consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold. The final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the thematic release. Minor elevated diction (“temporal prison”) is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Frozen-time chess village fused with self-forgiveness is a fresh synthesis. The tapestry-as-memory mechanic and copper offering transform familiar tropes. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
