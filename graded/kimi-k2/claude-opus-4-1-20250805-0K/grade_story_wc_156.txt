<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s oscillation between methodical control and playful surrender is embodied in micro-choices—flipping the coin, sealing it back—each with visible cost. The interior contradiction (certainty vs. curiosity) is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Marcus functions only as echo, so relationship crucible is minimal; Elena’s earned stasis (renouncing certainty) is credible and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena’s deliberate re-concealment crystallizes the loop while foreclosing full knowledge. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of nested awakenings intensifies through acoustic reverb and mural motion until final cadence shift. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in the acceptance of eternal return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound Wave Garden is not backdrop; its acoustic panels bend whispers into heartbeat, constrain how Elena hears future echoes, and charge the final image. Micro-setting (coin, spiral) likewise constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and urgent. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened once when Elena chooses to re-hide the coin, accepting eternal rediscovery. Escalation is accretive: each reflected sound deepens the uncanny until stance crystallizes. Agency drives the turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the forfeiture of final understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of recursive awakening emerges from concrete events (coin flip, mural rotation) without authorial statement. Final image—paint sealing the coin—offers non-literal answer: wonder preserved by deliberate ignorance. Subtext in acoustic reflections and mirrored faces sustains ambiguity without drift. No moralizing; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, synesthetic, slightly breathless under acoustic pressure. Syntax modulates with emotional crests; perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Dialogue minimal but natural when present. Compression (“the moment…expanded into its own space”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern (spiral, echo) without clutter. Rhythm accelerates during coin spin, breathes at closure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity (“reflected sounds suddenly shifted pitch”) advances story. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—acoustic garden that externalizes recursive time—is fresh synthesis of sound art and ontological mystery. Tropes (time loop, magical coin) are transformed through sensory specificity and character stake. Risky structure (eternal return without exposition) pays off in resonant final image. Feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
