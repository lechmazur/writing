<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s insomnia and inherited vocation are embodied in trembling hands and the “bubble of breathable grief,” but the leap from mortician to underwater librarian-undertaker feels more asserted than earned; the final renunciation lands with cost yet lacks a prior micro-choice that makes the shift inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Silas becomes guardian of the drowned library, earning rest by giving it to others. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each catalogued civilization layers pressure until the lens’s final pulse reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the mortuary’s empty note.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The drowned city library is rendered in coral-encrusted specificity; the broken lens constrains Silas’s descent and later reframes consciousness itself. Sensory grief-water and floating tomes anchor the impossible space without exposition drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—Silas’s need for rest—tightens as each drowned book demands burial. The librarians’ exhaustion escalates pressure; revitalizing the lens forecloses his return to the surface, paying the price on the final note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of undertaker-as-insomniac to undertaker-as-dream-guardian; the final image of “silence bloomed like funeral flowers” reweights all prior grief without moralizing. Subtext in the librarians’ black-hole eyes carries the cost of endless witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, salt-stained, and precise—“rainbow ghosts,” “bubble of breathable grief”—with rhythmic control that mirrors Silas’s exhaustion. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to his trembling perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“mausoleums from coral and memory”—and never clutters high-pressure beats. Final cadence slows to earned stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise fuses mortuary rites with drowned civilizations in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight; the lighthouse lens repurposed as prism for consciousness is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky underwater logic is taught early and paid off.</comment>
