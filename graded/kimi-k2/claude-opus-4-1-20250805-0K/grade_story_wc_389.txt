<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlowe’s “variant allegiance” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“tomorrow tastes like copper”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final smile feels more symbolic than earned, lacking a palpable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the Prophet’s broadcast crystallizes the new age while Marlowe’s unseen cost is felt in her “work…nearly complete.” Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the mosaic shards could be more tightly braided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt portico, storm, and radio array are rendered with tactile specificity; the glass’s “cerulean shadows that bent impossibly” constrains the final image, reweighting the dawn. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite lyric compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake— midwifing the Prophet’s rise—tightens through escalating static and spectral voices; the cost is conceptual (her anonymity, the world’s irreversible shift) but less viscerally felt than required for the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation via obsolete frequencies emerges through pattern, not statement; the final “new song” reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in the humming glass and ghost broadcasts sustains resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically propulsive, syntactically varied, and filtered through Marlowe’s technician-mystic perception; the occasional portentous flourish (“history’s lungs”) is earned by cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent within the story’s physics. Minor scaffold (“fragments of…”) appears but never clouds causality or the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of radio mysticism and astronomical oracle feels fresh; the Prophet’s emergence via dead frequencies is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
