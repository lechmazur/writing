<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“turbine-hum reverie”) and embodied, but the final renunciation (“no longer needed directions”) feels slightly abstract; the cost of leaving GPS behind is asserted rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of sheltering artists across eras tightens into Charged Poise as Marina joins the lineage. Closure lands with conceptual cost—she forfeits technological certainty for ancestral compass—though the GPS resurrection beat blurs the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-archway is tactile and constraining (wind guides blade, stone frames shelter); driftwood-as-micro-setting channels ancestral knowledge. Environment actively shapes tactics and final sculpture, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform fragments into wholeness while sheltering. Escalation is accretive—each historic artist tightens the weave—culminating in visible forfeiture of GPS certainty. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of trans-temporal creative kinship emerges through image, not lecture. Final spiral sculpture reweights prior driftwood motif into non-literal answer about continuity; avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise (“storm-song Marina heard now”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through sculptor’s grain-oriented gaze. Rhythm modulates with storm intensity; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional elevated diction (“timewoven alliances”) stays within lyric contract. One paraphrase loop (“every storm, every tide, every creature”) slightly dulls momentum; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: GPS failure as portal to ancestral maker-space. Risky lyric compression pays off; premise is specific to this archway, this storm, this sculptor. Transformation test passed.</comment>
