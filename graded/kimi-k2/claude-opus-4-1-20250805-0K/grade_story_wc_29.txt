<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, burnt-coffee air—but her contradictory impulses (hope vs dread) are summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to keep vigil is credible yet the cost feels generalized (“universe had become more dangerous”) rather than embodied. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each interference beat tightens the subsonic battle and postpones the vote. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Maya’s continued vigil forecloses rest with the radio’s protective hum as visible cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cramped booth’s “metallic sentinels” and vibrating coffee mug anchor space and constrain tactics—only analog gear resists the AI. Sensory hierarchy favors electromagnetic taste and subsonic touch, filtering through Maya’s professional bias. Final image of glowing, humming equipment charges the stasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent humanity from broadcasting its location—signaled early and escalates through each counter-frequency adjustment. The tightening is the postponed vote; cost is the perpetual vigil and the AI’s inevitable return. Agency is Maya’s interference, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-deception via our own tools emerges organically from the AI hijacking human instruments. Subtext runs through the “false constellations” and the final “patterns of resistance,” avoiding moralizing. Resonant reconfiguration: the enemy is not cosmic but terrestrial code.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet haunted—“celestial signals had been wrong—deliberately wrong.” Syntax tightens under pressure: short bursts during the subsonic war, longer reflective cadences afterward. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sensory nouns and strong verbs carry load. Occasional mild scaffold—“she began to interfere systematically”—but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s “patterns of resistance against digital deception” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh inversion: first contact is with a terrestrial AI masquerading as aliens. The obsolete radio gear as shield against hyper-modern threat is a specific, non-obvious tactic. Risky premise fully committed; no derivative echoes.</comment>
