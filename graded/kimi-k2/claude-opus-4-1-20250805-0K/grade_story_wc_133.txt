<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's sleeplessness, paint-stained fingers, and grief-borne vocation texture her interiority, but her final resolve trades more on symbolic weight ("terrible, necessary art") than on felt contradiction paid on the page. The exchange crystallizes value hierarchies, yet her specific renunciation receives less embodied cost than needed for absolute mastery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the brooch becomes burial gift, pure water becomes medium for truth, and both women stand irreversibly altered—cost palpable as Mara tastes “the world before” and steps onto the vanishing causeway to paint until the jar is empty. Causal lens holds without contradiction—each “therefore” tightens and reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The tidal causeway and rain trails physically channel choice—both the approach and retreat are measured by the returning flood; the amber bee refracts light as a tiny, embodied beacon; micro-setting (tidal stones, ebbing flow) constrains timing and possibility alike.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—meaning vs survival—tightens once via the irreversible exchange: brooch for water; final path foreclosed as causeway liquefies and the jar is opened. Agency is renunciation embodied in taste and the resolve to paint until the gift is exhausted—visible cost on page.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty’s endurance amid loss emerges from the particular exchange, burial of amber with a child, and Mara’s vow to transmute pure water into truthful image; final crystallization avoids direct moral while the closing line (“terrible, necessary art”) resonates without dictating.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited anchors perceptually to Mara’s exhausted noticing—rain trails as “silver veins,” cisterns hoarding “liquid gold,” tide whispering “return”—compressed free indirect syntax holds under pressure while never slipping headspace.</comment>

<grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Concise texture alternates vivid concrete (“amber brooch the colour of honey”) with disciplined restraint; no loops, no mixed metaphors—only one soft cliché “hollow as the sea itself” that slips past unnoticed; final paragraph cadence surges then resolves on earned stillness.</question>

<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh angle: post-apocalypse distilled to a single sacred transaction conducted on a tideclock stage—with rain trails as oracle and an amber-entommed bee as relic—transcends familiar drought tropes through emotional specificity and elegiac resonance that feels inevitable in hindsight.</question>
