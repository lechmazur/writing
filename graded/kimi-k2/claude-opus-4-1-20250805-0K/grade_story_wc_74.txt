<question>1</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—insomnia as bridge to memory, brush as conduit—but key moves (public posting, social miracle, group formation) leap over visible personal risk; no felt cost shows on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: images accrue, moon-tipped brush remembers, kindness scripts bloom. Closure beat—“the saffron quiet held them all”—is a lyrical Charged Poise reconfiguration, but the social outcome reads external, costing Mira little beyond the painting.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rooftop greenhouse as micro-setting is concrete (soil bags, steam from herbs), constrains movement, and the moon’s light on glass becomes essential tool rather than backdrop; spatial anchors and sensory layering stay vivid yet selective.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (remembering kindness across languages) is signaled early; pressure accrues via accumulating memories, but actual narrowing of personal options with visible price is absent—external gathering happens to the city, not to Mira in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of kindness transcending tongues emerges organically from brush strokes and strangers’ replies; avoids sermonizing and lands in communal image. Ambiguity—what the symbols truly mean—is purposeful, sustaining resonance without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice balances painterly lyric with tactile specificity: “curves like water, angles like bird wings.” One-line dialogue snippets sound authentic; free indirect style stays clean and coherent. Rhythm swells and ebb with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Strong sensory density, occasional metaphor overload (“saffron-tinted smog hung like gauze”) but no mixed vehicles; rhythm breathes well. A few filter stacks (“she could almost taste”, “she realized, she saw”) slightly blunt otherwise taut prose.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresco of lost alphabets summoned by moonlit paint is fresh; avoids tidy “art fixes all”. Synthesis of rooftop garden + communal digital archive feels organic, not gimmick, even if outcome edges utopian.</comment>
