<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers dancing,” “icy warmth”), but her contradictory impulses (duty vs obsession) are stated more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of tampering with the station is asserted rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lever locks, the field stabilizes, and Ira sees time’s web—an earned perceptual shift. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each micro-choice layers toward the final reconfiguration with visible, felt cost (frost forming on glowing surfaces).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Laboratory Seven’s magnetic nexus and the amber starlight are rendered with selective, purposeful detail that constrains Ira’s choices; the “mechanically warm” processors and frost-glow paradox charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving time’s sideways motion—tightens through escalating micro-adjustments of the lever and field; pressure grows under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a visible cost (station shudder, frost/heat clash) that forecloses safe reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of temporal perception emerges organically from Ira’s embodied experience; the final image of time as a vibrating web reweights earlier beats without moralizing. Subtext in the creatures’ “subdued awakenings” quietly reframes human certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and scientifically literate; perceptual signature filters every detail through Ira’s technician mindset. No head-hopping; diction and rhythm modulate with the magnetic pulses, maintaining coherent psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language (“time folded like origami”) is sparse and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “icy warmth” repetitions, but the cadence supports pressure rather than stalls it. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time premise is synthesized through alien biology and holographic physics in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking in temporal mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of the station’s paradoxical heat/frost anchors the concept.</comment>
