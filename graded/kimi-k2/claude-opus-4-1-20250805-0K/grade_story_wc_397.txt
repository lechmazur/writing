<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the parasol tip functions as a tactile rosary that anchors Marlene’s altered state. Motivation—learning the music of endings—drives her to volunteer for ice-watch, but the causal link between “loose grip on reality” and specific micro-choices remains more asserted than dramatized. The final renunciation (staying to listen) carries felt cost yet leans on lyrical summary rather than a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marlene elects to remain, foreclosing her original suicide plan with the cost of perpetual witness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure thickens through the ice’s song and the evacuations—culminating in a cadence shift rather than causal reversal. Orientation is swift; the fold-in-time premise is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The drift-ice marina is rendered with selective sensory detail—sound of calving, golden dawn on broken white—that constrains every choice and charges the final image. Micro-setting (observation post, parasol tip as neural delta) functions as extension of body and stakes. Spatial choreography is clean; weather evolves causally with events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to live after a failed death—tightens as each evacuation accelerates and the ice’s song grows louder. Agency is mostly observational; the single decisive tightening is the dawn choice to stay, which carries conceptual cost but lacks a prior on-page reversal that would elevate tension further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation-through-ending emerges organically from the ice’s music and Marlene’s altered perception. Subtext is carried by gesture (gripping the lace tip until it cuts) and silence rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise: endings are not terminus but ongoing harmony.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the ice’s crescendo. Perceptual signature is distinct—sound as geometry, lace as neural map—without head-hop. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within Marlene’s contemplative register.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and musical, each sentence advancing image or pressure. Occasional figurative layering (“frozen cemetery,” “paper cranes returning to flat sheets”) risks overwriting but remains purposeful. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph achieves charged poise without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of a failed euthanasia tourist turned Arctic witness feels fresh; the fold-in-patience concept is non-obvious and fully inhabited. Tropes (ice as mortality metaphor) are transformed through specific sound-craft and embodied stakes. Risk lies in lyrical abstraction, but coherence holds.</comment>
