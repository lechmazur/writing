<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s contradictory impulses—rage at betrayal versus need for purpose—are embodied in the tightening around the pillbox and the choice to descend. The final “no longer burned but forged” crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Minor: Viktor’s apology feels slightly expository, not fully lived in his body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each snow-code tightens the path toward the folder, and the pillbox’s reprise reweights the premise. Closure lands as Margot pockets both pillboxes—decisive change with felt cost: exile or uncertain return. No causality breaks; even the off-stage Moscow fire is causally framed as intentional burn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bluff’s mist and melting snow-codes physically guide her descent and mirror internal thaw. The engraved pillbox functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. One minor drift: “silver-hushed dawn” repeats the earlier “silver hush” without fresh charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver or walk away—tightens once when the folder’s weight is felt. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible: three years of exile crystallized into a single irrevocable step downhill. Could edge higher if the mole threat were more viscerally tested on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-scars emerges from the pillbox and melting codes, never stated. Final image of “everything broken could be mended—or at least transformed” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in Viktor’s “come home” carries layered betrayal and invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, weathered, and specific to a spy’s perceptual habits—ciphered snow, morphine tablet as talisman. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She picked up the folder, feeling its weight—lighter than three years…” No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, each sentence advancing goal or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful: “mist rolled…like a living thing.” No loops or scaffold. One near-repeat: “silver hush” / “silver-hushed” but spaced enough to read as motif rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: burned-spy trope inverted into intentional forging; snow-codes as living dead-drop feels new. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off. No close echoes of famous spy scenes; the pillbox reprise is earned, not gimmick.</comment>
