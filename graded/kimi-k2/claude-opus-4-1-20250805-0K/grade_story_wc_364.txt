<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Korin’s meekness-as-listening is embodied in every hammer-stroke; the contradictory impulse to refuse power yet wield it charges the final gift. His interiority stays concrete (“metal remembered everything”) and the cost—descending alone, forging with dream-silk—is visible. The merchant’s tremor externalizes the blade’s emotional price, completing a crucible relationship. Only the grandmother backstory drifts toward label rather than lived scar.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blade reweights the premise—cut bindings, not connections—at undeniable conceptual cost to the merchant’s traded sleep. Causal chain (silk → descent → forge → gift) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each hammer beat deepens pattern until the final image crystallizes. No orientation debt; anchors (orchard planet, floating arches) arrive by line 3. One seamless transition to the mine shaft keeps the single-scene window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating stone arches and drifting cherry blossoms are not backdrop; they model the planet’s negotiated gravity and foreshadow Korin’s refusal to “fall” as failure. The abandoned mine shaft’s thin-reality chambers constrain forging method—intention shapes metal—charging the final blade. Sensory selection (cooling iron, impossible silk colors) stays urgent to the task. Environment, tool, and body converge in the charged image of blossoms “falling upward.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming bartered consciousness—tightens when Korin chooses to descend and later when the merchant’s tremor pays the felt cost. Escalation is Accumulative: each hammer strike layers density until the blade’s azure defiance reconfigures options. No external antagonist; pressure is the collective exhaustion woven in silk. Agency remains Korin’s throughout; luck never intervenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specific inversion of commerce—dreams traded for productivity—without sermon. The final image of blossoms falling upward offers a non-literal answer: surrender to gravity can be flight. Subtext lives in the merchant’s silence and tremor; no character states the moral. Resonance lingers in the reader’s bodily memory of lost sleep.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays rooted in Korin’s perceptual signature—scarred fingers, listening meekness—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors the deliberate hammer rhythm; compression (“He descended.”) is taught early and paid off. Diction (“azure defiance,” “bartered awakenings”) feels forged, not decorative. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: “Cut only what binds.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Density is high: “woven from dreams of those who’d forgotten how to wake” does world, theme, and object work simultaneously. Rhythm modulates from long orchard breaths to staccato hammer strikes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of orchard planet, dream-silk, and meek blacksmith feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes (mystical forge, chosen one) are inverted: power is renounced, not seized. Risky lyric compression (“blossoms fell upward”) lands with conceptual cost intact. Specificity throughout prevents generic transplantability.</comment>
