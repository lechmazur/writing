<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—archivist duty vs. truth-released—are embodied and acted upon; the final upload forfeits her job and reputation with visible, felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: Marcus’s letter triggers the network resurrection, which drives Vera’s climactic treason, ending in an earned Charged Poise. The resolution narrows all options to a single, unrecoverable choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cryogenic vault constraints pressure choice (temperature rising thaws files). Each tool (quantum key, dormant terminals) is tactilely handled and reweights the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or release “contraband truths”—climaxes as the vault thaws in real time, forcing Vera to trade safety for disclosure with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes as secrecy itself becomes the crime; subtext lives in maximally charged silence—Vera’s hand on glass as snowfall muffles her betrayal. No moral sermon: just earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice cools like metal under frost—exact diction, layering tech-prose with Hitchcock quiet. Micro-choices (heat signature ink) are perceptually specific and rhythm-controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Purpose-driven density: every clause tightens tension (“echoing library under snow... titanium”). Zero loops or filler; polished without scrubbing the icy blade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh re-skin of trope—“archivist as revolutionary”—with irreversible heat-sorority. Quiet sight of thawing documents feels both new and inevitable.</comment>
