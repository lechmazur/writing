<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aldric’s interiority is vivid—his tactile reading of the trees and cracked voice during the oath embody exile and yearning. The contradictory pull between withdrawal and surrender to possibility is dramatized when he takes the puppet’s hand, dissolving armor and self. Cost is visible: his body becomes “between flesh and possibility,” a permanent liminal state. The shift from isolation to guardianship is earned by the orchard’s living equations and the oath’s price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (silver trees, crystallized fruit, marionettes) tightens until the greenhouse membrane cracks. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Aldric’s transformation into guardian reweights all prior imagery. Orientation is clear by line 5; the endless night is taught early and pays off when “cracks of light” appear. Causality holds: the oath triggers the marionettes, the handshake seeds new trees, expansion follows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but pressure system: silver-barked trees solve equations, obsidian floor leaks starlight, curtains untouched by decay. These details constrain Aldric’s path—he must read the trees to proceed, must perform on the puppet stage. Final image of “unmanifest tomorrows” is charged by the orchard’s glow. Spatial choreography is clean; the puppet’s click across obsidian anchors the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Aldric’s choice between exile and surrender to infinite possibility. Escalation is textural—each sensory layer (copper air, glowing fruit) intensifies until the greenhouse walls become permeable. The decisive turn is the handshake: it forecloses solitary knighthood and costs corporeal certainty. No coincidence; all pressure arises from orchard rules and the oath’s activation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between certainty and potential; the orchard literalizes “could-be.” Subtext lives in gesture: the marionette’s bow is not servitude but recognition of mutual transformation. Final image of “unmanifest tomorrows” reframes earlier exile as stewardship. No moralizing; resonance arises from Aldric’s embodied dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “fruit of crystallized potential,” “shivering bliss.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pressure. POV remains locked to Aldric; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—he reads branches like theorems, tastes copper and snow-melt. Rhythm modulates with emotional crest, culminating in silver-bell laughter.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line layers sensory data or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—“living equations,” “liquid starlight”—and serve world logic. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and structure. Final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs without redundancy. Clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, puppetry, and quantum possibility; avoids generic portal fantasy. The orchard as calculator-trees and the oath in pre-human language feel inevitable yet new. Transformation of knight into guardian of unmade worlds is earned, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (lyric density, liminal closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
