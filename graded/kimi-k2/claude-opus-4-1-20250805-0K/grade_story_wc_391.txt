<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s seventeen-year vigil and embodied patience are credibly dramatized; the contradiction between wild impulse and sculpting restraint is shown in micro-choices (placing rods, breathing control). The final smile carries earned cost—she has traded her solitude for collective freedom. Tomás appears only to confirm off-stage action, so relationship crucible is minimal, but interior stakes are fully inhabited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct’s new song reweights the world’s cognitive chains. Causality is accumulative—each copper rod and lunar angle tightens the pattern until the magnetic tide turns. Orientation is immediate; the frozen lake and basalt columns are anchored by touch and reflection in the first 120 words. No lens ambiguity; the lyric cadence teaches its pattern early and pays off in the dawn hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Basalt columns glazed with ice, moonlit reflections, and the magnetic hum under Kira’s palm create a tactile micro-setting that constrains every step and tool placement. Weather and freeze are not backdrop but clock and crucible. The sanctuary’s geometry literally guides the circuit she builds; remove the setting and the entire mechanism fails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing thought from the Council’s synchronization—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened beat by beat as rods redirect the viaduct’s flow. Each placement narrows the option of retreat; the cost is the irrevocable exposure at dawn. No external reversals, but the internal escalation from patience to irreversible act is legible and sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges from Kira’s bodily discipline and the moon’s indifferent clock, never sermonized. The final image of the lake reflecting a “fundamentally changed” world offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence after the last rod is set: freedom first feels like falling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and lunar-cold: “sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for vigil, clipped fragments for the final pulse. No POV leakage; meteorite instruments and copper rods stay within Kira’s perceptual lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual: “The others are in position.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic; every image advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; “magnetic pull of the viaduct humming beneath centuries of volcanic rock” does triple duty. Rhythm accelerates toward the dawn blush, then exhales into the final line. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of geomancy, cognitive control, and lunar revolution feels fresh and inevitable. Basalt organ pipes and meteorite instruments are not quirky ornaments but integral to the mechanism. The patient-ice metaphor for revolution is reversed: freeze is not stasis but catalyst. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant closure.</comment>
