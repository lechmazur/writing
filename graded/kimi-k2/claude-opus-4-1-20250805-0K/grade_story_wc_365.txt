<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—synesthetic translations, embodied urgency—but her contradictory impulses (map vs. heal) are stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The mother’s exhaustion is sketched economically, yet their reunion dialogue tilts toward exposition. Closure choice (map the repairs) is earned, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each crossing thickens sensory density until the nexus reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; causality holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “map the healing” crystallizes new purpose with conceptual cost (their gift wounds reality). One transition (bay → nexus) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Repair bay iterations are sharply particularized—bioluminescent fungi, sideways gravity, underwater bubbles—each filtering through Kira’s synesthetic lens. The bay-as-nexus finally constrains the choice to mend rather than roam. Micro-settings (shard, nexus threads) likewise guide tactics. Sensory overload is disciplined to urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find mother vs. cost of mapping. Escalation is textured, not causal: each universe adds sensory weight until the fraying threads force the ethical pivot. Agency is clear in the final “we map the repairs,” but the price (perpetual exile, labor) is implied more than dramatized. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: exploration as both wonder and wound. The shard’s cyclical returns reweight from escape tool to suture needle. Subtext in mother’s harmonics and the dissolving shard avoids moralizing. Final image—restoration bay—resonates without explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct synesthetic voice—“rust became the taste of copper bells”—remains consistent under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. Dialogue is spare but carries interdimensional harmonics. No POV drift; perceptual signature is character-locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined to sensory mapping. Occasional stacked metaphors (“synesthetic ribbons… violet whispers”) flirt with excess but serve pattern. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph cadence slows appropriately for closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic cartography as ecological sin and cure. Tropes (multiverse, lost parent) are retooled through sensory specificity and ethical inversion. Risky structure—lyric crossings without traditional antagonist—pays off in the reparative pivot. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
