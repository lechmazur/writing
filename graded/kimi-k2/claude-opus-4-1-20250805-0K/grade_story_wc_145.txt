<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her dry wit, precise micro-choices, and contradictory impulses (secrecy vs. trust) are dramatized in scene. The final decision to share the phrasebook is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost. Minor slip: the inspector’s arrival feels slightly convenient, nudging the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Margot’s choice to trust the inspector crystallizes the stakes and reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern recognition (condensation, dog-ears) tightens until the final image. Cost is legible in the shared phrasebook and the held breath before thaw. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen lake, rusted outpost, and condensation on glass are selective, sensory, and purposeful. The setting constrains choice (isolation, cold) and charges the final image (lake as keeper of secrets). Micro-setting (frost patterns, rusted desk) integrates with action. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the rivers—escalates through pattern discovery and the inspector’s arrival. One meaningful tightening: sharing the phrasebook forecloses secrecy. Cost is felt in potential betrayal of Commonwealth trust. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: buried knowledge, trust, and the patience of hidden water. Subtext in the phrasebook and condensation pattern reweights meaning without moralizing. Final image (lake waiting) offers non-literal resonance. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, dry, and character-specific; perceptual signature filters every detail. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual. Final cadence crystallizes tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory detail is vivid yet economical. Final image is unmarred by line-level artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm supports closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: atlas editor + polyglot phrasebook + condensation watershed. Tropes (frozen outpost, secret discovery) are transformed through specific lived detail and linguistic archaeology. Risky quiet ending pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
