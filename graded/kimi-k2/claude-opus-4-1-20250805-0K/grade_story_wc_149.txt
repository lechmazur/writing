<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlow’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “mournful elation” is felt in gesture and voice. The ghost bride’s agency is thin; she speaks and acts but her choices are pre-ordained by lore, not fresh contradiction. The final renunciation (letting her go) is earned by the bead’s crack and the flood of ancestral memory, with visible cost in Marlow’s tears and the greenhouse’s mortal turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s destruction dissolves the centuries-old causal loop and restores natural dawn. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned returns of the ghost, bead, and night thicken until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the bead’s dust and the orchard’s withering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s glass, mercury pools, and luminescent fruit are vivid, selective, and purposeful; they constrain Marlow’s every move and charge the final image when they revert to ordinary apples. The winter-cracked fields and starless sky function as macro-setting, but the greenhouse itself is the micro crucible that shapes tactics. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—breaking the debt—is signaled early and tightens once when the bead pulses faster. The ghost’s announcement that “the barrier thins” forces the decisive release. Cost is visible: the orchard’s immortality traded for dawn, Marlow’s inherited duty dissolved. Agency is Marlow’s endurance and final surrender; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of toxic preservation versus liberating loss emerges through the ghost’s “lovingly venomous” protection and the orchard’s alchemical sterility. No explicit moralizing; the final sunrise reweights all prior imagery without a thesis. Subtext in the bead’s cracked longing and the bride’s dissolution invites reflection on love that binds across death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates under the bead’s pulse. Perceptual signature is Marlow’s alchemical sensorium—resin tears, mercury scent, phosphor glow. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“You’re early this year” speaks volumes).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“luminous fruits pulsed like hearts”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction fits the alchemical register without register drift. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The alchemical-ghost-orchard fusion feels fresh; tropes of spectral bride and philosopher’s stone are transformed through specific material stakes. The dawn reversal is earned, not gimmicky. Risky compression of centuries into one crack of a bead pays off in a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
