<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s numbness is embodied in the glass jar and mirrored sparring, but the interior contradiction—wanting feeling yet fearing merger—stays stated rather than dramatized until the final beat. The micro-choice to lift the jar crystallizes motive, yet the cost of creating a “child” is asserted, not felt. Secondary pressure from Master Chen is clear but generic; his dialogue reads as exposition. Overall, a credible arc with visible stakes, but emotional embodiment could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decision to vivify the backup reframes the custody stalemate into generative synthesis. Causal chain—court ruling → numbness → Chen’s thesis → sparring insight → acceptance—holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is swift; the floating dojo and duplicate stakes are anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the final image of “holding my future in a jar,” though the price remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystalline dojo, low-gravity sparring, and Earth spinning below create a tactile, selective environment that mirrors Marcus’s suspended state. The jar functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice. Details are filtered through Marcus’s anesthetized perception, keeping description purposeful. One slip: “historical revision—the third this month” is told, not shown, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who gets to be Marcus—tightens when Chen reframes the duplicate as complement, not rival. The sparring beat provides a visible escalation that forces stance crystallization. Cost is implied in surrendering sole claim to identity, but the price could be sharper on the page. Agency stays with Marcus; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity seeking wholeness emerges through the mirrored sparring and the idea of a “child” consciousness born from shared numbness. Subtext operates in Chen’s sword placement “right over my heart.” Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. One thematic echo—“Numbness is just possibility waiting to be born”—verges on aphorism but lands within character voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, slightly detached, matching Marcus’s post-split affect. Syntax stays clean; no head-hopping. Dialogue from Chen is functional but lacks idiosyncrasy. Perceptual signature—selective attention to light, gravity, jar—remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or motive. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“vivify,” “complementary opposite”) fits the speculative frame. One mixed metaphor—“architecture where feeling could live”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The consciousness-duplication custody battle is refreshed by reframing rivalry into generative synthesis. Specificity—floating dojo, amber jar, mirrored swordplay—grounds the concept. The final turn feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Minor risk in speculative jargon is justified by coherence.</comment>
