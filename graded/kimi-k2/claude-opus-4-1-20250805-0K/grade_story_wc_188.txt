<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaia’s interiority is vivid—her chant fuses memory, craft, and present need; the mosaic artist’s single line crystallizes shared motive. The final choice to “make our own constellations” is earned by prior communal labor and carries visible cost in the sustained burn of the kerosene knot. Minor: the elderly woman’s backstory is compressed to a single clause, limiting relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers material and rhythm until the courtyard’s darkness is reweighted by the collective light show. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in the chorus of voices and the lingering glow that forecloses despair. Orientation is anchored by the moss-lit wall within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The phosphorescent moss, kerosene rag, and mosaic tiles are not backdrop but ingredients; the fortress stones literally supply color for the fireworks. Micro-setting (courtyard mosaic) constrains the final launch zone and is recharged by the burst that rewrites the sky. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Kaia’s designer eye—green of moss equals copper flame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defy the Dimming’s despair—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the first rocket’s sustained bloom proves the tactic viable. Agency is communal yet led by Kaia’s micro-choice to share technique; the cost is the kerosene knot’s slow, irreversible burn. One clear escalation: from solitary chant to collective ignition that narrows the future to continuous making.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: creation as resistance to cosmic loss. The mosaic plea “REMEMBER WONDER” is not moralized but enacted; the final image of self-made constellations reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext in the fire-spinner’s tearful gift hints at prior failures, adding moral depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and rhythmic—“sulfur and saltpeter, charcoal and stars” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the closing chorus. POV remains tightly anchored to Kaia’s sensory filter; no head-hopping. Compression in “steady as a promise” balances lyricism with propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “the fortress bloomed differently that night” condenses transformation in one line. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances craft or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—phosphorescent walls “breathing green light” is vivid without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of fireworks craft, starless apocalypse, and communal mosaic-making feels inevitable yet fresh. The kerosene rag knot transforms from performer’s despair to collective beacon, a non-obvious re-purposing. Risk in the quiet, non-violent climax heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
