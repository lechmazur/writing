<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edgar’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection vs. hiding—are embodied in micro-choices (lowering the light, clutching the tape). The final renunciation to remain unseen is earned by prior pattern of gifts and carries visible cost in the withheld reunion. Interiority is specific, sensory, and avoids label-speak. Only the archivist’s interiority is inferred, not dramatized, keeping the cap below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Edgar’s decision to stay hidden yet collaborate reconfigures the relationship without explicit meeting. Causal chain—cache → gift → recognition → invitation → acceptance-in-absence—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image of continued guardianship. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library’s crawl space, copper pipes, and dawn light constrain Edgar’s movement and visibility; the tape reel itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Environment subtly guides the choice to remain unseen. Meets 9+ gate: the building’s hidden arteries shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Edgar will reveal himself—tightens when the archivist voices recognition. Escalation is one deepening beat: the invitation reframes the cache from gift to collaboration. Cost is the continued solitude. Agency remains Edgar’s; coincidence (power outage) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unseen caretaking emerges through pattern of gifts and reciprocal recognition, never stated. Final image crystallizes the quiet ethic of stewardship without moralizing. Subtext in the lowered light and abandoned tape player carries more weight than any dialogue. Resonance lingers in the reweighted meaning of “visibility.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Edgar’s sensory field; perceptual signature is tactile and nostalgic. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—longer cadences for memory, clipped fragments during the gift-drop. No head-hopping. Voice remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“sapphire hush”). No loops or scaffold. Sentences advance story or atmosphere without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“constellation of memory”) fits Edgar’s reverent stance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “ghost in the library” premise is familiar, yet the execution—ferromagnetic tape fragments as memory constellations, reciprocal invisible collaboration—feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of medium and method transforms trope. Risk in quiet, non-meeting ending pays off through charged poise.</comment>
