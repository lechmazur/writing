<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—her body reacts to the pendant’s hum, her inherited guilt drives her leap across canals—but the final renunciation (“honored in their ending”) feels slightly abstract; the cost is stated rather than embodied. Still, her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release) play out in scene and the choice forecloses her grandmother’s path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the stolen minutes return, Morteus wakes, and the city’s cadence resets—an earned Conceptual Repricing with visible systemic cost. Causal chain holds: because she completes the drawings, the borrowed time collapses. Orientation is swift; rooftop canals and pendant cue place/time within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is more than postcard; its upward flow and temporal residue physically guide Marina’s route and later reverse to signal the reset. Morteus’s body-as-architecture constrains movement and supplies the chamber of suspended moments. Sensory detail is selective and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped extinctions—tightens once Marina discovers the chamber and must choose: keep her illustrations or release their endings. The cost is systemic (city loses borrowed minutes) and personal (pendant cracks). Agency drives the reversal; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of borrowed time versus the dignity of completed extinction. The final image—clear canals, living creatures drawn anew—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through the cracked pendant and reversed water, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical yet urgent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Marina’s illustrator eye (“unfinished moth wing,” “thick with temporal residue”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short beats during canal leaps, longer cadences inside the chamber. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Minor scaffold (“she knew what this meant”) and one mixed metaphor (“time sculptable, like clay”) nudge it below 8.5. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud rhythmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of extinct-species ethics, giant-dream time-banking, and canal infrastructure feels fresh and inevitable. Risky temporal mechanics are fully committed to and paid off. Only the grandmother backstory feels lightly sketched; otherwise, a singular artistic stance.</comment>
