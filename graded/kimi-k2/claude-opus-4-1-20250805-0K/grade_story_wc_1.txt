<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. end the poisoned legacy—play simultaneously in the final beats; the renunciation to walk deeper into the canyon is earned by the frost’s wordless lesson and the felt cost of letting the world believe her dead.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost patterns, ledger strip, and studio ashes layer meaning until the dawn light reconfigures the stake; closure is a Charged Poise—she steps forward carrying both the strip and its erasure—cost legible in “someone new was being born.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon walls, frost, and burnt paper anchor every beat; the frost’s micro-structures literally teach her the alternative to radioactive luminescence, constraining the final choice to abandon the toxic legacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—end the uranium-glass lineage—tightens once when the frost offers a harmless glow; the cost is the staged death of her public self, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: poisoned beauty vs. transient, harmless light; the frost’s “brief, harmless luminescence” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marina’s perceptual signature; sensory selectivity (frost crystals, scorched paper texture) and rhythmic control under pressure create a distinct, glass-artist’s lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, no loops; figurative language (“canyon walls held their breath”) is sparse and purposeful; final paragraph cadence mirrors the dawn’s slow reveal without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of radiation history, glass craft, and frost physics feels fresh; the transformation of “poisoned glow” into “harmless luminescence” is an earned, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
