<comment>Marina's survivor guilt and refusal are credibly embodied; contradictory impulses (need to testify vs fear of commodification) play in scene through her pacing-spell choice. The cost of refusing to appear as official witness is dramatized when she must keep walking names into marble instead of walking up the stairs. Interiority remains concrete—“still woke gasping from smoke that wasn’t there”—rather than therapeutic summaries. Small flaw: status dynamics with second survivor underused.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens held as Accumulative/Textural: pattern of word-walks escalates stakes toward Earned Stasis closure. Each foot-spelled step tightens the private archive against public demand; final “W-E-R-E-M-A-I-N” freezes choice with visible lifelong cost of carrying the unheard names. Orientation crystal-clear by 3rd paragraph; no causality breaks, only single compressed beat upstairs that retreats exactly as closure requires.</comment>

<comment>The whispering gallery’s curved marble is weaponized—its acoustic loop amplifies private testimony into parliament-sized echo to refuse the media gallery above. Absence of pawns reweights from décor to argument about expendable lives; these absent pieces plus the acoustic dome constrain every step Marina takes and charge the final image of unheard names still travelling the curve.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve unmedia-tized grief—is signaled immediately. Stakes tighten when invitation arrives and Marina chooses archive over witness stand; one choice forecloses a public path forever. The missing pawns supply visible cost: without pawns, strategy collapses into bare memory labor. Agency remains on her pacing feet alone; luck complicates (door opens) but does not resolve crisis.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly: official memory vs private witness; the luminous absence of pawns argues that omission itself speaks louder than presence. Subtext in final line reframes the missing pawns as the actual constituents any new government will never seat—an unannounced repricing that rebukes spectacle politics. Avoids meta commentary by keeping argument inside marble acoustics and living breath. Small echo of earlier “crisis actor” label felt as payoff, not lecture.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric rhythm—long sensuous sentences that breathe with dome echoes—matched to single POV sensory narrowing. Word choice always filtered through Marina’s disaster-tested attention: parliament is “abandoned”, rats “hold votes”, whispers “travel like ghosts”. One filter loop “She moved… her feet tracing” early, but purposeful as it teaches the pattern later used for closure. Pronoun stability perfect; no dialogue registers needed.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High density lines—“wandering between legitimacies… breathless pause between governments”—compress abstract politics into concrete bodily breath. Rhythm builds on repeated anaphora “each footfall”/“tonight she traced” that acts as incantation. Almost free of scaffold; only slight redundancy “forever approaching but never quite reaching” flagged; clarity intact and serves the crescendo. Zero typos or shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: national interregnum plus survivor-as-crisis-actor conspiracy plus chess game with only royalty generates an image immediately recognizable yet previously unseen. Risk pays off: refusal to supply exposition turns the absence of millions of pawn stories into the central argument. Details feel inevitable in hindsight—acoustic arch as inverted parliament, walking-spell as anti-testimony. No derivative line or echo detected.</comment>
