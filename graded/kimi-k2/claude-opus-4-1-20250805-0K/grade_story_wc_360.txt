<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—simultaneously preserving and dissolving selves—drives every micro-choice; the final “smiled with seventeen different mouths” crystallizes the cost of accumulated empathy. Borrowed personalities wrestle in real time, not summary, and the halo fragment’s pressure forces a stance that forecloses any return to a single self. The only cap is a hairline slip: the phrase “mathematics of emotion” edges toward diagnostic label-speak mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellation of printed sheets replaces the vanishing stars, and the cost—“I couldn’t remember which personality was originally hers”—is legible on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each printed sheet layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; causality is taught through the halo fragment’s progressive heat and the star-count drops.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The topaz walls refract dying starlight into prismatic constraints that literally color Mira’s choices; the final sheet-constellation reprises the opening stellar void, charging the closure. Spatial anchors are immediate and tactile—“crystalline walls caught and refracted”—and the workshop’s open roof makes the vanishing stars a live clock. Only the faintest excess of visual layering keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve selves as stars die—tightens with each stellar extinction; the pressure is coherent and cumulative. The decisive turn is the conscious choice to print a hundred variant broadsheets, trading personal coherence for cosmic salvage. Cost is visible: identity erasure announced in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: identity as typography arranging absence. The ending’s “everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts” reweights every prior sheet without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silver-to-gold-to-forgetting ink shift, never explained yet resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is unmistakably Mira’s—precise, synesthetic, mathematically inclined yet lyric. Patterned elision (“lucid turbulence,” “equations all divided by zero”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even under seventeen overlays.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“residual divinity,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and never muddles causality. One minor paraphrase loop—“each message was precisely calibrated… nothing was random”—dulls momentum for a beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—empathic letterpress as stellar preservation—feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing print culture, astronomy, and identity theory into a singular vision. Risky lyric compression and cosmic stakes cohere without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration of stars into sheets is a fresh inflection that could not be transplanted to another setting.</comment>
