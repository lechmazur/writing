<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is specific—her “tender and distant” handling of supplies, the embodied ache of recognizing her grandmother’s brushstrokes—yet the final beat of placing her own shell beside the others crystallizes her stance with visible cost: she now carries a double exile. The contradiction between loving and letting go is dramatized, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked mirror’s omen resolves into revealed lineage and a charged poise—Marina will return to the quay but now inhabits the cave’s secret. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each shell layers a temporal echo that reweights the final image without causal contortions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The phosphorescent cave walls and the grandmother’s shell archive are rendered with selective sensory density; the cave’s glow literally frames Marina’s final choice, constraining her to paint in its “brief forever.” Spatial choreography from quay to hidden cove is coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to love impermanence without paralysis—is signaled early and tightens when Marina confronts the archive. The cost is felt in her decision to sustain a double life: public painter and secret archivist. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of cherishing what must vanish. The final image of the shell holding “the sound of the sea—always present, never quite graspable” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Marina’s perceptual signature—“her movements both tender and distant.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Compression (“ghost painter, always present but never quite there”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—“caves yawned like dark mouths” serves immediate mood and later echo. Final cadence slows to crystallize the poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hidden cave archive of painted shells reframes the familiar trope of the vanished mentor into a meditation on temporal stewardship. Specificity of place and inheritance makes the premise feel inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
