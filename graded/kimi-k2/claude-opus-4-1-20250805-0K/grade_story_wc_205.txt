<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassia’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary fire vs. post-defeat weariness—are embodied in her trembling grip on the shard and the sudden flare of “familiar fire.” The final choice to resurrect the Venusians is earned by her lived history of failure and the shard’s ghostly validation, with visible cost in her “unshed tears” and the storm’s approach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Cassia’s stance crystallizes from defeated exile to architect of resurrection, the shard pulsing “as if the ghosts within recognized a kindred spirit.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each temporal ripple and mirrored possibility layers pressure until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid’s gilded chambers and temporal storms are not mere backdrop; the mirrors draped in black silk constrain action (they must stay covered) and charge the final image when Cassia speaks of “what we might have been.” The shard itself functions as micro-setting, bending light and time to reveal the Venusian ghosts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who controls the Venusian legacy—tightens when Cassia proves the shard is a memory map, forcing Huang’s curiosity to override protocol. The escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals: the ghosts’ appearance raises the cost of possession from artifact to resurrection, narrowing options to collaboration or erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: defeat as lens for empathy, preservation as rebellion. The final image of Cassia speaking “in verse” while temporal storms paint “liquid history” offers a non-literal answer—some defeats prepare unimaginable victories—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “weathered fingers,” “robes of impossible colors,” “burnished bright by time’s passage.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long, winding sentences in reflection, clipped declarations under fire. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Cassia’s perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“baroque chambers,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by the ornate setting and Cassia’s poetic bent. Rhythm breathes with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Venusian soul-crystals + Versailles-in-space + visible time streams. The premise commits fully; no retreat into generic SF tropes. The shard’s dual role as evidence and resurrection key feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
