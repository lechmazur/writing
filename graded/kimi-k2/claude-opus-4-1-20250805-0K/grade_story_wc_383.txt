<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—yearning for peace yet haunted by its price—are embodied in the bleeding palm and the shell’s pull. Micro-choices (digging, pressing halves together) reveal a hierarchy of values culminating in earned integration. The flaw of self-erasure drives every beat; the cost is the reopened wound of grief. Only the “tragically radiant” label edges toward diagnostic speak, blunting full 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reintegrated memories reweight Marina’s identity with visible cost—“the seashell, whole but scarred.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of resonance, perfume, light density tightens toward dawn. No causality breaks; every beat advances knowledge or stakes. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The velvet garden’s petals constrain movement and mirror interior darkness; the shell’s mother-of-pearl becomes micro-setting that literally stores memory. Sensory selection narrows under urgency—dirt like inverse stars, perfume of forgotten summers. Final image of rainbow patterns on shell recharges the setting’s dying light. One notch off 9 only because spatial choreography could be tighter during the dig.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integration versus erasure—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each whispered coordinate. Agency drives escalation: Marina chooses to excavate, to reunite halves, to accept grief’s return. Cost is palpable in the reopened emotional wound. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as architecture, not pathology. Subtext in the shell’s “familiar unfamiliarity” and the garden’s absorptive blooms. Final image of “memories learning to dance” offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“calcium carbonate lattices,” “inverse stars”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the dig. Perceptual signature filters every detail through Marina’s skeptical wonder. No POV leakage; tense stable. One minor register drift—“metadata of extracted experiences” feels academic amid lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors coherent. Minor overwriting in “resonance structures that shouldn’t exist” slightly dilutes immediacy. Otherwise clean, vivid, read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-quarantine as literal shell-archiving, grief as resonance physics. Tropes of trauma recovery and magical objects are transformed through specificity and embodied cost. The final reintegration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure pays off.</comment>
