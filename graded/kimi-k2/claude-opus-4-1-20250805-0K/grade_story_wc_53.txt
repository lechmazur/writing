<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the past while redefining her purpose—play out in embodied micro-choices (winding the camera wheel, pressing it to her ear). The ghost’s silent demand forces her to articulate and re-price her identity, culminating in an earned renunciation that costs her architect’s dream. Interiority is concrete, specific, and tied to tactile objects; no stock labels. The final nod-dissolve crystallizes a visible cost: she accepts the role of memory-keeper, foreclosing the old ambition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the carousel’s halt is the narrative moment when all timelines collapse into a single charged poise. The camera wheel’s final click reweights every prior fragment, and the ghost’s dissolution confirms the cost—Kira’s transformed purpose. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern taught early by “time moved differently” and paid off in the mist-merge. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lagoon’s anti-gravity rules are learned through action (scavenging, listening to water-borne voices) and constrain every choice—Kira can’t leave, can’t rebuild, can only collect. The carousel’s brass pole and vapor-soaked ticket booth function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “condensation on a brass pole” carries an overheard warning. Environment and object together force the reconfiguration of ambition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Kira will surrender to nostalgia or repurpose her fragments—tightens when the ghost appears and the carousel stops. One decisive deepening: the realization that “the world built itself without us” narrows her options to memory-keeper. Cost is visible in the ghost’s nod-dissolve and the slow restart of waters. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ambition can transform rather than die, and memory is a form of architecture. The final image—waters beginning “as if learning how”—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (ghost’s silent hand) and object (camera wheel reweighted from documentation to legacy). No thematic echo; complexity lingers in the ambiguity of progress.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in scavenger pragmatism: “worn those ambitions down to nothing, like rust eating through iron.” Perceptual signature is sharp—Kira notices gear teeth, vapor echoes, and the weight of her bag. Compression (“seventeen years…three miles above”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains tight and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “the lagoon had absorbed…stories the lagoon had absorbed” is intentional echo, not loop. Metaphors are precise (“rust eating through iron”). Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—long reflective lines collapse into the staccato of “I have more pieces today.” Zero scaffold or redundancy; final line earns its hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating carnival sustained by thermal spirals is a fresh, non-obvious frame. The conceit that water molecules store voices feels inevitable once taught. Transformation test fails if relocated to generic post-apocalypse; specificity of aerial scavenger-archaeologist is integral. Risk-taking (non-linear time, ghost-self negotiation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
