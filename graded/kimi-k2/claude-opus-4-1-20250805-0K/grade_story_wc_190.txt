<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is specific and embodied; his lived experience as both ferryman and former seeker gives weight to the guidance he offers. The woman’s shift from rigid panic to softened stillness is rendered through bodily cues, not diagnosis. One causal gap: we do not see the prior crisis that qualifies Marcus to teach, only the assertion; this keeps the arc slightly abstract.</comment>

<comment>The ending lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—her listening stance crystallizes the re-weighting of “silence” itself, with Marcus’s 12-year tenure and the storm glass equilibrium as visible costs. The single, continuous ascent-descent arc satisfies Track A scope while the acoustic terraces supply coherent pressure. Orientation is anchored by word ~80 and re-anchored on descent; no disorientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The drifting prism terrace is never wallpaper; its acoustic rules actively constrain Marcus’s navigational choices and sculpt the woman’s emotional arc. The storm glass vial behaves as micro-setting, constraining atmospheric knowledge and pacing; its warm flare cues the final adjustment. Spatial choreography of gondola tilt and platform sequencing is vividly specific yet never over-described.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can silence be taught to comfort”—escalates as each terrace amplifies or muffles evidence. One pivot: Opal Arch’s three-second delay reframes her own gasp into music, narrowing escape tactics. Cost is visible in Marcus’s bodily monitoring and in the storm glass’s final equilibrium, proving the alteration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The theme that “comfort is presence without intrusion” emerges from concrete sonic transformation rather than exposition. The refrain of the fading train whistle returns as lullaby—subtle, earned, never moralizing. No thematic Echo in final paragraph; resonance rests on the image of listening without flinch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Marcus’s perceptual signature: “prism terrace where light bent into impossible angles” and the “felt cost” of cable vibration beneath his palms. Syntax modulates with rhythmic purpose: longer sentences during drift, clipped fragments under pressure. No POV slippage; the woman’s interior is read only via breath and shoulder tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Prose is lean yet musical—“caught and held sound differently” compresses world rule and sensory appeal in six words. Minor scaffold: the clause “the reason they sought these heights” could drop without loss. Otherwise zero loops, no mixed metaphors, consistent diction congruent with Marcus’s taciturn vocation.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The world of acoustic architecture feels fresh, not a veneer over steampunk airships. The prism terraces, Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald platforms, and delayed echoes are vividly conceived. The conceit might veer toward gimmick, but is grounded in Marcus’s practical labor—tilting the gondola, adjusting cable tension—so remains specific rather than decorative. Risk is present and paid off.</comment>
