<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—guilt over her mother’s death and fierce love for her newborn—are embodied in the cracked saucer and the onyx cards; her final act of laying the “restoration” spread is earned by prior causality and visibly costs her the safety of fixed regret. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only cap is that the mother’s apparition is more symbol than second character, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended saucer and invisible-ink birth announcement crystallize the reclaimed time with felt cost—the mother’s absence remains, but its binding to the daughter’s future is loosened. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of traced hands → card spread → sealed crack reweights the premise without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early by tactile cues (“onyx-ink cartomancer traced her fingers”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The midnight glade’s silver grass and transparent leaves are selective, sensory, and purposeful—each detail constrains Elara’s ritual choices (the dew that “had never touched earth” cues the liminal rules). The saucer itself functions as micro-setting, its crack glowing to guide the final beat. No orientation debt; spatial anchors remain stable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing her mother’s death-shadow from her daughter’s life—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the cards “unfasten another moment from its fixed place in regret.” Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible acknowledgment that her mother saw the birth yet still cannot stay. No external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of time’s reclamation emerges through the traced-hand custom and the saucer’s repair; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “invisible ink” holding accumulated time offers non-literal resonance that reweights earlier motifs. Subtext in the mother’s “pouring nothing into nothing” carries apology without declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature—“breathing air that tasted of lilacs and lightning.” Patterned elision (e.g., “formed from mist and memory”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “decades of lost moments had crystallized into a hairline fracture” does triple duty (time, object, emotion). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax (“The saucer’s crack sealed itself”). No loops or mixed metaphors; minor elevated diction (“cartomancer”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancy + traced-hand family ritual + cloudbound afterlife of squandered hours feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens. Specificity of the dolls’ tea-set shard rescues the premise from generic “time magic.”</comment>
