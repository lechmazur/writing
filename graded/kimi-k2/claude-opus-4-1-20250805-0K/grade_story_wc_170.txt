<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the borrowed heartbeat and the tremor when the sparrow sings—but the final choice (completing the painting) is more ritual than active decision; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized as a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of paint and lullaby intensifies the pattern until the sparrow’s song crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration; the hush-before-bells device tightens cadence and the cost (time running out, silence ending) is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The prism parapet, rain-slick stones, and echoing terrace are not backdrop but instruments—light refracts to teach the “mirrors show possibilities” rule, and the sparrow’s rainbow-damp feathers charge the closure; setting constrains and enables the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reach Sophia through painted doors—is signaled early; pressure tightens as dawn nears and bells threaten; the sparrow’s lullaby marks the decisive intensification, though the cost is more conceptual (time’s end) than tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reality-as-possibility emerges organically from paint, light, and song; the final image of “invisible doors opening” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“rainbow fragments trapped,” “hush stretched like taffy”—with a perceptual signature tuned to color and echo; patterned elision (coded lullabies) is taught early and paid off when the sparrow sings Sophia’s melody.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful, no loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with urgency—“worked faster now, her calmness deepening”—and the final line lands clean without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of painting-as-map, heartbeat-as-bridge, and lullaby-as-code feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking in the magical-realist frame heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the sparrow’s song twist is earned by earlier patterning.</comment>
