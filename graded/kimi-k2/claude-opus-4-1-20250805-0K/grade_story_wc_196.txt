<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied—his tactile reading of dust, the warmth of the button in his palm, the micro-choice to photograph the note all reveal a hierarchy of values. The contradiction between institutional duty and personal archaeology is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final renunciation—returning the button and adding Timothy to his private index—earns its cost through prior causality and visible emotional labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus crystallizes his stance as witness-archivist, foreclosing the path of private vengeance or simple retrieval. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the final beat: “leaving the archives to their patient dust.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The foster care file room is not backdrop but active constraint—dust patterns guide discovery, fluorescent light releases “tiny spirits,” the metallic whisper of the button triggers the entire plot. Micro-setting (button, folders, marginalia) repeatedly constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering hidden kindnesses within institutional cruelty—is signaled early and tightened once: the discovery of Timothy’s note forces Marcus to reconfigure his own search from private need to public witness. Escalation is accumulative: each artifact raises the cost of silence. No coincidence resolves the tension; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between institutional erasure and individual grace. Subtext operates in marginalia, penciled whispers, and the silent return of the button. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Marcus becomes the amplifier of small kindnesses—without moralizing. Resonance lingers through the charged image of dust resettling as “small rebellion against forgetting.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and emotionally calibrated: “the dust had its own language,” “metallic whisper,” “repository of society’s most vulnerable histories.” Syntax mirrors Marcus’s careful, reverent attention. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates naturally—long reflective sentences give way to crisp, tactile beats. Information density is high: “dust motes unfurl…like tiny spirits released from bondage” does triple sensory, thematic, and plot work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—an emancipated foster child archiving his own past through institutional detritus—is fresh and specific. The button as inheritance, the marginalia as love letters, the dust as palimpsest all transform familiar tropes. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes of famous scenes. Risk-taking (quiet, lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
