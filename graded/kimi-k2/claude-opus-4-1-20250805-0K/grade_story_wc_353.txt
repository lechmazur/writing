<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “symphonically minded” perception is dramatized through tactile choices with the porcelain insulator. The single POV holds; her empathy drives every micro-choice, and the final renunciation (setting down the cracked tool) carries visible cost. No contradictory impulses are staged in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove now holds an “acoustic architecture” that reweights the premise of permanent silence. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each strum layers density until the final cadence shift. The porcelain’s new cracks record today’s song, a felt cost that persists. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is rendered through selective sensory detail filtered by Mira’s trained ear; the stress cracks in bark and porcelain alike constrain her technique and charge the final image. Micro-setting (tool-as-setting) meets the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore organic sound—is signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative: each recovered note tightens the emotional cost of inevitable silence’s return. The final choice to leave the grove with only “ghost of birdsong” forecloses immediate further extraction, carrying felt loss. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between violence and tenderness: “force would only create new silence.” The porcelain’s new cracks reweight the motif of memory-as-scar without moralizing. Final image of the hedgehog “listening” offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures the reader’s sense of what restoration costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—“she recognized whole movements waiting to be freed.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Experimental compression (“ghost of birdsong”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“crystallized vibrations” is earned by context. Final third is artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of trees as living phonographs is fresh; execution grounds it in tactile process. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Transformation test: story collapses if any core element (porcelain, stress cracks, empathy) is swapped. Hedgehog reprise is an earned, non-gimmick closure device.</comment>
