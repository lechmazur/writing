<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her “weathered hands,” the “color that had no name”—and her creative compulsion drives every beat. The final act of planting while weaving worlds is a credible renunciation of safety, with the cost of lifelong solitude legible in her smile. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Reflection stays under 20 % and alters tactics via dream-derived plan.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of shimmer, color, and ritual builds until the seed’s split reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the new Lumenwillow’s twin spirals crystallize stakes and foreclose Mira’s remaining years. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is visible in the final image: “woven forever between worlds.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The parapet, waterfall mist, and moss-covered stones are not backdrop; their between-state is the literal medium Mira stitches. Sensory selection narrows to touch and shimmer under pressure. The setting constrains the final choice—only this liminal soil can cradle the seed—and charges the closing image with mist that “flowed through both worlds.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s unnamed color—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each cut of air thickens the shimmer until the pocket of soil becomes the only viable path. The tightening forces Mira to risk total failure; the cost is her remaining life-force, felt in the hush before the seed splits. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the act itself: wonder must be co-created between realities or perish. The unnamed color is never labeled; its preservation is dramatized, not stated. Final image of twin spirals offers a non-moral answer—wonder endures but only through perpetual liminality. No late thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“mist like honey,” “seed opened like an eye.” POV remains tightly focalized through Mira; no head-hop. Compression and elision (“sixty years” in one clause) are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. Syntax modulates with ritual slowness, then quickens at the split.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (e.g., “droplets of possibility”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates at climax—“seed split, but not in the way of ordinary germination”—then resolves into quiet awe. Clean grammar, precise punctuation, zero typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of orchard craft and inter-world horticulture feels inevitable yet fresh. The pruning shears as needle, mist as thread transforms a familiar gardener into mythic artificer without tipping into allegory. Risky lyricism heightens stakes and lands with crystalline clarity. No derivative templates or close echoes.</comment>
