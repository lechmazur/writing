<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremors through her consciousness”), but the transformation arc leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final renunciation—carrying the dreams inside her—earns its cost yet feels slightly pre-ordained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirror fragment layers density until the dawn reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—she leaves the canyon “carrying within her neurons the museum.” Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon and shattered mirror are rendered with selective sensory precision; the mirror’s Fibonacci cracks physically constrain how Vera decodes memories and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams—tightens once when Vera chooses neural modification; the cost (irreversible synaptic rewiring) is visible in the tremors and dawn departure. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-helix emerges organically from mirror cracks and neural rewiring; final image reframes the graveyard as “museum of humanity’s interrupted futures” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, scientifically precise, emotionally porous. Syntax mirrors Vera’s helix obsession (“chaotically precise”), and perceptual signature is consistent. No head-hop; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “abandoned dreams” refrain, but rhythm varies and no mixed metaphors intrude on closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of submarine graveyard + neuro-archaeology; the Fibonacci-cracked periscope as memory-helix is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands.</comment>
