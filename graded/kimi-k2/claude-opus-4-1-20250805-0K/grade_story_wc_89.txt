<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory drive—yearning for death yet fearing dissolution—remains embodied in trembling hands and paradoxical steadiness; the final choice to become a bridge is earned by the prior sensory ordeal and carries visible cost (loss of singular human form). Interiority is concrete, but the “cosmic intimacy” register drifts toward abstraction in the reunion beat, blunting embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s transformation into living conduit reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—she can feel Kess everywhere yet never hold her again. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent-pattern, orchard stasis, and phoenix echo accumulate until the final image crystallizes the new state. One felt price: “outwardly human but fundamentally altered.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Everbloom Orchard’s eternal moonlight and petrified blossoms function as micro-setting that constrains choice: only here can the spice-scent breach the veil. Sensory selection is purposeful—pearl-white petals, cinnamon-starlight fusion—yet the orchard’s rules remain consistent. Final image recharges the moonlight as warmer promise, tying setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—tightens once: the spice-scent ritual forces the irreversible metamorphosis, foreclosing simple reunion in favor of cosmic fusion. Agency is Mira’s; cost is her singular self. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each sensory shift deepens the irreversible merge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of love’s persistence beyond form emerges from the orchard’s frozen bloom, the phoenix cycle, and the final moth-image; no moralizing. Subtext in Silverwhisper’s nuzzle and blank fortune carries the reweighting. The ending’s non-literal answer—“love changes frequency”—resonates without abstraction overload.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Mira’s perceptual bias: “paradoxically steady in my uncertainty” teaches the pattern early. Syntax modulates with stress—fragments during dissolution, longer cadence in reunion. No head-hopping; Silverwhisper’s dialogue stays fox-like and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“cosmic tapestry,” “temporal saffron”) flirts with overwriting but serves the mythic register. No loops or scaffold. Final moth-image is crisp and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of phoenix lore, spice alchemy, and beast-whisperer myth feels fresh and inevitable. The orchard’s eternal moonlight and cinnamon-starlight scent are specific inventions, not stock fairy-tale props. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure without gimmickry.</comment>
