<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s traits (colorblindness, flower-language knowledge, cunning innocence) are concrete and drive key choices—she trades art for time, manipulates Enzo with plant messages, and reframes imperfection as beauty. Interiority shows struggle rather than labels, but the final shift (forgiveness bloom) feels more externally gifted than internally fought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single shard progresses under Causal lens: Mira’s request → flower message → reed gift → daughter return, each because/therefore tightening options. Closure (father-daughter embrace) is on-page with felt cost—past denial burned, present gesture costs pride. Orientation anchors early; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Courtyard is sketched in tactile details (shimmering dew, kiln heat, potted herbs arranged with purpose), and glass shards catching light charge both theme and final image. Constraint is mild; setting pressures choice but rarely blocks it outright.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “get courtyard time to keep painting.” Stakes sharpen with each failed counter-offer; flower messages and reed tongue escalate emotional bargaining, paying visible social cost. One clear reconfiguration—father yields after daughter’s return—earned by earlier cues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—beauty in breakage—emerges through accumulating images: shattered glass luminescence, reed singing in glass, chrysanthemums in ruins. Final image crystallizes without moralizing; complexity is preserved in father’s tears and Mira’s gray vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical voice in close third; flower language and colorblind observation create idiom. Compression (“I paint what I see”) and rhythmic cadence match emotional stakes. No head-hopping or register drift; free indirect style remains clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is crisp and sensory, though occasional cliché (“shimmering with morning dew”) and over-adornment in flower lists slow momentum slightly. No loops or filter stacks; figurative language seldom muddles causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind beauty-seeking + old flower code + post-phoenix barter economy. Risk of sentimental “repair with flowers” tempered by retained ruin and father’s ongoing grief. Daughter’s arrival felt earned by sonic lure of reed.</comment>
