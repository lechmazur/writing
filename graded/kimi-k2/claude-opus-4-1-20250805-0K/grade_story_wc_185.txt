<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“weathered fingers,” “second, quieter heart”), but the mapkeeper’s contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; her final choice to let the bloom teach rather than suppress the beings is credible yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bloom’s expansion reconfigures the cave’s sonic ecology and the mapkeeper’s stance, with the cost of lifelong maps now obsolete. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final image reweights silence as active force.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harmonic caves, echo chamber stone, and frozen pool are vividly rendered and directly constrain tactics; the stone’s shifting luminescence and the ice’s fracture patterns guide every move, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—restoring balance against alien crescendo—is signaled early and tightens once when the bloom’s expansion forces a stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the mapkeeper’s acceptance that her maps must be rewritten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of silence as generative rather than absence emerges organically through the bloom’s action; final image of “transformed symphony” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—sound as geography, silence as bloom—sustained throughout; rhythmic control under pressure (“patient certainty of dawn”) and no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor loop risk in repeated “gentle luminescence” phrasing, but each recurrence reweights meaning. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic cartography and alien acoustics; the bloom of hush as crystallized silence feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming familiar “restore balance” arc into resonant conceptual reweighting.</comment>
