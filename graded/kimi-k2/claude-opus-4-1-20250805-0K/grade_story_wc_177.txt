<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s contradictory impulses—playful detachment vs. aching need to understand—are embodied in her micro-choices (smile, lip to seal). The final renunciation is earned by the causal loop revealed through Chen’s dreams, with the cost of never escaping the loop legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kira’s realization that foresight is backward memory reweights every prior beat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of countdowns, storm percussion, moss-light—culminating in the charged image of footprints swallowed before they’re made.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker, bioluminescent moss, and rust-bleeding directive are not backdrop; they constrain movement (water rising, stairs echoing) and charge the final image. The neural crown’s crystalline nodes become micro-setting that alters tactics and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why some paths choose their walkers”—is signaled early and tightened by the countdown beats. The storm’s live clock and rising water force stance crystallization; the cost is the irreversible loss of linear agency, visible when Kira steps into light already knowing she’ll return younger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the causal inversion: choice as illusion within deterministic memory. The final image of footprints erased before creation offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the central question, reweighting the entire narrative without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“thunder that shook dust from the ceiling”). Perceptual signature—selective sensory filtering, playful diction masking dread—remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“tears of iron,” “trapped stars”) is sparse, taught early, and paid off at closure without cluttering peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The time-loop premise is transformed through Kira’s embodied cost and the bunker’s living decay. The synthesis—prophecy as memory—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky structure (reverse causality) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; no derivative echoes.</comment>
