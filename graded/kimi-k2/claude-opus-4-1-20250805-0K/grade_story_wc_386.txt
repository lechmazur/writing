<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—gloves, melted plastic, borrowed starlight—but her contradictory impulses (treasure vs. truth) are stated rather than dramatized in-scene; the final “climb toward the surface” is earned yet cost is more asserted than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each candle, frost-face, and melted spire layers density until the chemist’s revelation reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Marina now bears antidote and future map—cost legible in “borrowed starlight in her hands.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glacier shrine is tactile—rivulets, candle heat warping ice—yet never overwhelms. The shrine’s candlelight literally projects the map onto the ceiling, constraining her next dive; micro-setting becomes macro-destiny.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage truth from wreckage—tightens when the chemist reveals twelve more globes. One clear deepening beat: Marina shifts from passive listener to active transcriber, foreclosing the option to simply leave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of salvage-as-redemption emerges through specific images (melted city as encoded hope) rather than statement. Final image of “borrowed starlight” reweights the earlier candle motif without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“windows where others saw walls,” “dream architecture”—and stays within Marina’s perceptual range. Compression and elision (15 years in two clauses) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; only minor loop (“she had learned… she had spent”) drags. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors—and rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar ghost-whisperer trope is refreshed by the dream-cameo mechanic and the melted snow globe as living archive. Specificity of Arctic shrine + refugee bioweapon backstory makes the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
