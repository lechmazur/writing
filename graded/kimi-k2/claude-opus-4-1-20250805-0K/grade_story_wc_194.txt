<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Victoria’s interior contradiction—hunger for truth vs. need to relinquish it—drives every beat; the final renunciation is embodied in the thrown crank and the felt loss of omniscience. Micro-choices (inserting the handle, lifting the needle, hurling the brass) chart a clear hierarchy of values. The generational curse is sketched with efficient specificity, never generic. Only the slight summary drift in the middle paragraph keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Victoria’s decisive act forecloses the dynasty with visible cost—she trades omniscience for genuine solitude. Causal linkage holds: each turn of the crank tightens knowledge until the refusal snaps the chain. The lens is Causal; no ambiguity at the end. The broken window and mockingbird crystallize the irreversible change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sepia reading room, mahogany shelves, and brass gramophone are not backdrop; the crank and the standing waves physically constrain choice and deliver the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean; the thrown crank arcs through the broken pane with coherent physics. Only the grounds outside remain lightly sketched, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—end the curse or master it—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens with each crank turn. The single decisive reversal (lifting the needle, throwing the crank) narrows options to one: unknowing freedom. Cost is visceral: the sudden silence and the mockingbird she can no longer read. Pressure escalates causally without slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete dilemma: knowledge as inherited poison versus chosen ignorance as fragile liberation. The gramophone, the waves, and the broken glass reweight the premise without a single explicit moral. Final image of the singing mockingbird she cannot interpret offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with sepia-tinted diction that never slips into purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: Victoria notices textures, temperatures, and emotional frequencies in character-specific ways. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for reflection, staccato fragments at the climax. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers atmosphere, stakes, or sensory cue. Metaphors (“standing waves of perception,” “golden shadows stretched”) are precise and internally coherent. Minor scaffold in “she’d inherited the curse of being eloquently silent” could be tighter, but it does not touch the closure beat. No loops or mixed metaphors under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—truth-hearing as hereditary burden preserved in vinyl consciousness—is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The crank handle’s transformation from heirloom to discarded key is an inevitable reversal in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No recognizable template or echo.</comment>
