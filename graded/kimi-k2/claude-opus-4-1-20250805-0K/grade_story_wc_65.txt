<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“ink-stained fingers,” “quill trembled”—but the story leans on exposition rather than live contradiction; the decisive act (hanging the maps) is under-motivated on the page, though the cost (ceding credit) is implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Council’s “breakthrough” is revealed as Mira’s planted design, reweighting the premise. Causal chain is clear—maps → unconscious influence → policy shift—yet the final beat could be sharper in showing Mira’s personal cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Obsidian Spire and frozen lake anchor place and mood; the spire’s “no shadow” and the kingfisher’s dive recur to charge the final image. Micro-setting (ink-stained fingers, azure nib) constrains action and signals craft identity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seed innovation without overt coup—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses subliminal influence over confrontation. The cost is intellectual anonymity, felt but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation via invisible cartography rather than revolution. The final image of footprints “writing new paths” reweights prior maps without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“darkness cannot darken what already gleams black”—with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable; perceptual signature (seeing hidden currents, negative space) is consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language serves rather than stalls. Minor scaffold (“maps of places that didn't exist—yet”) is offset by high information density and vivid specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ignorance-cartographer premise is fresh, and the notion of “mapping voids” is synthesized through concrete tools (kingfisher quill, visual algorithms). Risk-taking (bureaucracy as riverbed) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
