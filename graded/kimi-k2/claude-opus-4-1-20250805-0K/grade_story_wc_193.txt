<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—bitterness toward the scheme and wonder at the farm—are embodied in her tactile handling of the bolt and her micro-choice to turn it. The final renunciation of victimhood is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the transformed diamonds. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy-speak. Minor slip: “virtuously mischievous” is asserted rather than dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bolt-turn crystallizes her stance and reweights the premise—she was never at the bottom. Causal linkage holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each glitch message and promise-spore accrues until the final image. Cost is legible in the line “learning to be the peak.” No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mushroom farm’s bioluminescent pressure and crystalline promise-spores are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Marina’s tactics. The bolt functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when turned. Spatial choreography is coherent; Dr. Chen’s terraces and harvest zone are anchored. One minor drift: “shadows dance backwards” is evocative but risks physics ambiguity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute failure into wisdom—is signaled early and tightens through the bolt-turn choice. Escalation is driven by Marina’s agency under the Accumulative lens: each promise-spore adds density until the decisive compression into light-diamonds. Cost is visible in the irreversible transformation of her past losses. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: broken promises become literal diamonds only when pressure is embraced rather than resisted. The final image reweights the pyramid scheme from scam to filter without moralizing. Subtext operates in the glitch messages and the bolt’s silent history. Resonance lingers in the paradoxical glow of “eternally, impossibly bright.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in Marina’s perceptual bias—she notices fungal stars and pressure physics. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; short clauses under peak stress (“Counterclockwise.”) heighten urgency. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Dialogue from Dr. Chen is spare and functional, avoiding register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is patterned and paid off (“mushrooms remember what diamonds forget”). No loops or scaffold; “luminous spores drifted like snow made of light” is the only near-cliché but earns its place. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryptocurrency scam, bioluminescent agriculture, and quantum metaphysics feels inevitable and fresh. The bolt-as-key twist is foreshadowed yet surprising. Risk-taking in conceptual compression pays off: abstract promises become physical diamonds without breaking internal logic. Specificity anchors the speculative frame.</comment>
