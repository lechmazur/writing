<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot climb, stardust breathing, and laughter as compass all embody motive—but the mirror-twin arrives late and functions more as symbol than crucible, blurring the cost of her final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed wick births a new dawn from ancient shadows, and the cost is felt in Mira’s “soft and satisfied” laugh that accepts perpetual stewardship. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The emerald lens and glass wick are not mere backdrop; their geometry literally steers ships and finally inverts to create the new dawn, constraining tactics and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shepherding reality itself—tightens when the mirror-twin appears, forcing Mira to harmonize rather than command; the price is the endless vigil named in the closing line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of navigation between possible worlds emerges through concrete ritual and inverted light; the final star-written truths offer non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice sustains wonder without purple drift; perceptual signature is distinct—“laughing backwards,” “storms from tomorrow’s memory”—and rhythmic modulation matches rising pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“blade through silk,” “angles that shouldn’t exist”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusing lighthouse lore with dimensional cartography feels inevitable; the reversed total internal reflection as cosmic engine is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
