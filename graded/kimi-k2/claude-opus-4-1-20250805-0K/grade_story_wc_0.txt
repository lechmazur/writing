<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s shift from data-driven detachment to humble witness is embodied in daily micro-choices—resigning, building stations, letting dust settle. Interior contradiction (precision vs. patience) is dramatized, not labeled. The final renunciation carries visible career cost and felt humility, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each visit layers dust density, pattern break, and cadence shift that reweights the stake from “save career” to “learn quiet renewal.” Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she stays, the greenhouse is spared—cost is the forfeited prestige and salary. No orientation drift; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s cracked glass, mud, mold, and butterfly dust are tactile, selective, and evolve with every beat. The setting constrains her choice of observation over demolition and charges the final image: dust patterns literally save the structure. Micro-setting (dust on beams) functions as tool and oracle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to witness catastrophe without theatrical despair—tightens through accumulating dust evidence that forecloses the old grant-driven path. One decisive intensification: resignation letter. Cost is career suicide, legible on page. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: true knowledge requires patient attention to minute accretions, not aggressive analysis. Subtext in butterfly dust as gravitational lensing reweights her prior cosmology without moralizing. Final notebook line crystallizes concept with conceptual cost—no drama, only instruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is precise yet porous, shifting from academic detachment to hushed observation. Syntax lengthens with wonder, shortens under pressure. Perceptual signature filters every detail through physics-trained eyes without jargon overload. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; every sentence advances texture or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Dust settled in patterns across the mud, delicate geometries” does double duty—visual precision and thematic echo. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron-star physics meets post-flood ecology via butterfly-wing dust. Familiar trope of scientist humbled by nature is transformed through granular specificity and non-dramatic closure. Risky quiet ending pays off; premise could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
