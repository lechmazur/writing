<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aldric’s interiority is rich and concrete, driving every beat of his desperate tenderness toward the egg; his sustained awe becomes a micro-choice that reweights the final image. The contradiction of hope against physical exhaustion is embodied consistently in trembling fingers and beard growth, which alter tactics under pressure. Balance would lose tension without Aldric’s specific sensorium guiding attempts and stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causality holds under a Causal lens: each incubation tweak triggers narrowed options until the cracked shell births a flawed genesis that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands via a Decisive Change—irreversible life—but the cost is felt in the broken claw and haunting song. Orientation is rooted by 60 words; time anchors in rolling glaciation and tremor count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The suspended palace, its groaning chains, and dripping stalactites actively pressure choices—warmth coils can’t break free of weight. The mechanical city scenery is filtered through Aldric’s biased lens, compressing “tick-tick-tick” into sorrow. Specific anchors (copper coils, condensation) supply resources that modify tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the Aurelius return or not—is signaled early and escalated via tightening options: every degree tweak risks the egg’s death. Flaw becomes visible revealed cost, foreclosing ideal resurrection. Stylized ending transforms the concept into measured grace under the inferred lens (earned broken genesis).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The broken-genesis theme emerges organically from Aldric’s flawed resurrection; it deepens with each failed calibration and crystallizes in demi-Aurelius. Subtext sings through warped wings and winding tears: creation itself is imperfect yet still worth cherishing. Final image reframes the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate diction trembles with fevered lyric rhythm; selective metaphors (“forgotten ornament,” “maze of pistons”) reveal Aldric’s awe and despair. No head-hop; perception narrows naturally under wind and solitude. Syntax modulates between acceleration (micro-ticking) and breath (dawn condensation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; vivid verbs (“coiled,” “cradled”) propel action while moments of exhalation allow resonance. Articulate but non-pompous vocabulary remains suitable to archaic scholar-prince voice. Loop checks clean—no synonym loops or filler stacks confounding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The combination of extinct-bird resurrection with suspended ritzy steampunk feels organic, chosen to literalize “forgotten beauty dangling mid-air.” No cliché rebuke is offered; instead, the broken songbird becomes unprecedented. Specific properties of the mythic Aurelius are essential to the flawed-genesis closure.</comment>
