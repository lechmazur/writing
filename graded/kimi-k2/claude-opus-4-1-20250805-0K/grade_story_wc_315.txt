<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the parachute-buckle tic and “watcher’s burden” crystallize her stakes. The final lie and shift from observer to guardian feel earned by prior tension. Secondary character (voice on radio) applies immediate pressure, though we learn little of them. Overall, a credible, flawed protagonist whose micro-choice reconfigures her path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s lie and stance shift carry visible cost (trust risk, self-imposed guardianship). Causal lens dominates—each beat tightens options until the final transmission. No causality breaks; ellipsis of six-month truth is motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sky-forest rendered through Maya’s sensorium—bioluminescent moss, aerial roots, fungal networks—grounds the impossible in sensory detail. Setting constrains choice: altitude limits escape, canopy height shapes data collection, atmospheric rules dictate transmission windows. Final image of luminous branches charges the closing beat with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—forest survival vs corporate harvest—signaled early. Pressure escalates via the unfamiliar voice and seven-minute window; Maya’s lie tightens her future risk. Agency is decision (lie, transmit coordinates) that forecloses corporate timeline. Cost is legible: personal safety and moral burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of stewardship vs exploitation emerges through action and withheld data, never sermon. Final silence and luminous canopy reweight prior observations into planetary stakes. Subtext in the breathing stranger and Maya’s lie invites reader to question all reports. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, reflecting Maya’s scientific attentiveness and emotional fatigue. Compression (“soundless echo”) taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Dialogue minimal but subtextual. Syntax modulates with tension; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Strong verbs (“floated,” “traced,” “cached”) and concrete nouns anchor the fantastic. Minor elevated diction (“transcends corporate interests”) fits reflective beat. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Upside-down sky-forest as carbon sink is a fresh synthesis of climate-science and mythic arboreal imagery. Tropes (lone tech observer, corporate menace) are transformed through bioluminescent ecology and fungal communication. Final lie as stewardship tactic feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky setting pays off.</comment>
