<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Morrow’s motivations—grief, loyalty, and curiosity—are instantly embodied: the glass eyes are handled at decisive beats, and her inventive calculus under stress reveals layered interiority that reconfigures absence into presence with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The closure unit (Elias as emotional equation) lands with Conceptual Repricing; the causal chain from mosaic → eye placement → revelation is airtight under an Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens stakes via reweighted loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard’s mineral-fed trees constrain every choice—twilight glow limits perception, stalactites drop tense rhythms; each detail pays off as bioluminescent mathematics, an irreplaceable micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Loss moves from abstract grief to live equation; escalation shifts from quiet grief to cosmic reweighting as the mosaic trade-off narrows options and demands the mentor’s sacrifice be reckoned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Ambiguous absence driving love’s persistence threads through every beat, culminating in the orchard as irrefutable proof—no moralizing, only recharged meaning via charged specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Morrow’s interior fatigue colors perceptions of limestone-salt air; compression in crisis (short sentences under dripping echoes) makes mathematics feel bodily, no head-hopping or diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Prose balances crystalline density with line-level propulsion: fungi rings “calculate what was versus what remained” accelerates heartbeat cadence without floral excess—zero loops or scaffold visible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes blind mentor, mineral orchard, and glass eyes into one inevitable companion equation—risky lyric form delivers coherence and originality that reweights loss without cliché.</comment>
