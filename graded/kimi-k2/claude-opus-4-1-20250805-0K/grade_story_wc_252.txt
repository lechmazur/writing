<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s fluid disguise-to-reveal pivots drive every choice; the binding removal is both embodied and socially priced. Torven’s gruff-then-vulnerable shift feels earned in dialogue and softened physiology. The heart-guard’s ache is palpable when he asks “Please”—a micro-choice that resets stakes. No interior label-spam; contradictions act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a CR: the island’s permanence reweights the Pacification rule-set—the world is gentle not through force but because authentic selves disarm. Cost felt when Mira leaves clothes and identity on shore. Causal links hold: scrimshaw heat → whale call → Cetacea solidifies. One tight lens shift from Accumulative to Conceptual Repricing at last wave.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Kelp forests, whale-song vibration through bone, phosphorescent surf—the sublittoral fringe is micro-setting protagonist. Props: scrimshaw glows body-warm, bindings lie discarded; both steer the dive. Setting constrains the only path to the island. Spatial choreography locked; tide meets trench without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—authenticity vs survival masks—rises from subtle dock tension to full renunciation. Whale call intensifies pressure rather than rescues. Micro turn binds Torven’s plea to Mira’s shedding; no off-stage coincidences resolve. Price is the body she abandons on the rocks; consequence etched for dock at dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: violence became impossible because people finally faced their true selves—shown, said only once in Torven’s line. The island image reprises Cetacea as earned paradox, not moral. Subtext in Mira’s trembling hands and the glow of bones. No final explanatory tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Wet-work cadence: “moved like water,” “trembled around the whalebone,” “gruff softness.” Mira’s inner register is taut, specific, non-clinical. Dialogue snaps: “found it in my nets” vs “please.” No POV leakage; perceptual signature stays dock-salt and rope-burn.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Clean compression: every sentence carries salt or bone glow; no scaffold or loops. Metaphor density balanced—none clog clarity. Final dive line arcs back to whale-song. Micro cadence breathes exactly twice. Rhythm feels read-aloud sea-surge.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Pacified‐but‐gentle world is fresh twist; violencelessness reframed as internal truth rather than external prohibition. Scrimshaw-as-key, disappearing island as externalized identity—transforms rather than tropes. No borrowed fantasy bones; specificity is lived dock-worker breath, not meta gloss.</comment>
