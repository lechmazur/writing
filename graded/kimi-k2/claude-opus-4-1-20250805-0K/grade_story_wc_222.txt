<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Renn’s interiority is vivid—her palm against humming ice, the warm sundial lid, the “cautious abandon” stance. Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release wonder) act simultaneously in the swap scene. The final renunciation—choosing questions over answers—carries visible conceptual cost. Minor slip: “cautious abandon” is slightly label-like, but embodied action redeems it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the amended board reweights the premise—wonder must stay unknown. Causal chain holds: master’s failure → Renn’s counter-method → Keeper’s concession → sky reconfigures. One clean transition (ascent/descent) fits scope. Cost is legible in the cracked king-mirror and the Keeper’s vanishing laugh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The spire’s ice, the impossible sky, and the living chessboard constrain tactics: wrong sky triggers arrival, ice hum guides ascent, board demands the swap. Sensory detail is selective—starlight in ice, colors that shouldn’t exist. Micro-setting (pocket sundial lid) becomes the final key. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—pass the Keeper’s test by redefining wonder—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: Renn swaps pieces, foreclosing the master’s path of hoarded certainty. Cost is the destruction of “priceless knowledge” and the acceptance of permanent unknowing. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder kept alive through deliberate unknowing. Subtext lives in the swap—wooden child-drawn constellations replacing star-names. Final image (mirror showing first magic) reweights all prior secrets without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“sky writhed in impossible geometries,” “wind through icicles.” Perceptual signature is Renn’s: tactile, thief-trained, wonder-struck. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression taught early (“cautious abandon”) and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but tonally apt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with altitude—short bursts on ascent, longer cadences in summit chamber. Figurative language disciplined; “frozen needle,” “liquid time” serve immediate purpose. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chess pieces as containers for epistemic stance, not power-ups. Transformation of familiar quest-into-tower into meditation on unknowing. Risky inversion—success through deliberate incompleteness—fully earned. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
