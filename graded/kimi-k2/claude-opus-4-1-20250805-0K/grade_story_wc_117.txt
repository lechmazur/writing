<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is rich and embodied—her therapist voice modulates under pressure, and the curl’s release is a micro-choice that crystallizes her arc. Sofia’s humming and hand-squeeze show distinct perceptual signature and generational echo. The mother-daughter crucible alters their shared state with felt cost. Only slight therapy-speak (“ordinary magic lived in repetition”) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, eclipse clock anchors time/place by 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: releasing the curl reweights the premise—love is the adaptive force—and the cost is the visible relinquishing of the keepsake. Causal chain: mailed curl → eclipse ritual → release → generational transfer. No orientation debt; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s temperature drop, shadow bands, and wind actively constrain the ritual; the curl itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection (copper-bright, luminous) is filtered through Elena’s maternal gaze. Spatial choreography tracks the two women and the envelope cleanly. Environment guides the choice to release the curl into the wind.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—passing wonder to the next generation—tightens as totality nears. One meaningful deepening: the curl’s release forecloses Elena’s path of possession and crystallizes Sofia’s inheritance. Cost is the tangible loss of the keepsake and the emotional exposure of the new melody. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through embodied particulars: lullabies, root systems, eclipse shadow. The final image—the unheard harmony in the corona—offers a non-literal answer: love’s song outlives objects. Subtext in the hand-squeeze and new melody avoids moralizing. Resonance lingers without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elena’s perceptual orbit; no head-hopping. Voice texture—softly adaptive, lyrical yet grounded—mirrors her profession and emotional state. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (“Five minutes until totality”). Rhythm modulates with eclipse tempo; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer sensory, emotional, and symbolic work without loops. Metaphors (curl as violin string, roots as symphony) are coherent and payoff at closure. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Final paragraph earns its cadence; zero artifacts in last third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar-musician myth + eclipse ritual + generational song. The curl’s transformation from keepsake to cosmic offering feels inevitable. Specificity of “dreaming roots” and “underground symphony” anchors universals. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off; no derivative templates.</comment>
