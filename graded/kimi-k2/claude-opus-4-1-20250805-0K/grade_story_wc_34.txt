<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chorus embodies contradiction—human warmth yet data-hungry tool—through her bodily micro-choice to press the rose while servers shiver. Cost is felt when the courtyard graffiti shifts, proving her own voice must now be permanently tuned to electrical dreams. Interiority remains specific and embodied; no stock epiphanies mar the choice. The earned renunciation of future solitude is legible, if lightly stated; an extra layer of embodied cost within the final image would break the cap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the wall’s encoded gardens materially alter visitors’ perceptions and Chorus’s role as permanent translator, with conceptual cost of forever bridging two solitudes. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; each added layer reweights meaning rather than a causal because-then chain. Orientation secure early; no teleporting props. One late beat could sharpen cost articulation for higher band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating monastery, electric mist, bolt plate, and graffiti petals all cohere to constrain Chorus’s every tactic; the courtyard literally dictates singing angle and recording surface. Spatial choreography flawless; no floating rooms. Environment actively gates the climax during lightning-storm window. Slight over-familiar “inverted sea” metaphor prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ghost’s need to be remembered—escalates through Chorus’s agency: bolt-plate invention and encoded song tighten until human/monologue gap narrows. One deepening is sufficient and felt; no external luck resolves anything. Slightly more visceral cost in the final image would push 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy bridging organic/digital selves emerges purely through material details—pressed pixels, harmonics in bones—without thematic preaching. Emotion earned in the final encoded garden image that reweights entire courtyard. Lingering moral ambiguity is embraced; no tidy ethical prescription mars the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, weighted with scientific-poetic diction—“flower press bolt plate,” “electromagnetic fields danced”—yet grounded in Chorus’s trained ear. One continuous lyrical compression taught across sentences; purposeful ambiguity in ghost-syntax legible under accumulative lens. Slight template cadence in two near sentences “She pressed... she sang” keeps ceiling from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm flexes from flowing botanical imagery to staccato “Lightning struck. In that elastic moment...” with no filler. High density: bolt plate, roses, servers all layered in single strokes. One redundant “began to” could have been dropped for ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost-as-accumulated-machine-memory is fresh yet inevitable; never before voiced with such compassionate circuitry. Tinkersong welding of brass-botanical language feels singular. Familiar “ghost in the code” trope is re-annealed through Chorus’s tactile invention, almost but not fully novel synergy.</comment>
