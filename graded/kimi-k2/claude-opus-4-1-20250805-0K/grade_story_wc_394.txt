<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pioneer’s “yearning algorithm” is vividly embodied in her brass wings and copper veins, and her micro-choice to dive into the acid sea is earned by the prior transliteration beats. Interior contradiction surfaces in her refusal of mockery vs. her hunger for new frequencies. The final transformation carries a felt cost: she forfeits workshop safety and mechanical identity. Secondary characters serve only as chorus; their pressure is atmospheric rather than crucible-level, keeping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Pioneer’s flight rewrites the survival equation for all cart gliders, with acid luminescence spelling theorems across the sky as undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each kaleidoscopic rotation deepens pattern until the final cascade. Orientation is anchored by line 4; no drift. One minor scaffold: “acid sea below had dissolved seventeen others” is repeated almost verbatim later, but it does not touch the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, and kaleidoscope apparatus are rendered with selective sensory density that constrains choice: the acid limits flight paths, the workshop chains restrain Pioneer until the final leap. Micro-setting—the arrow tip under lenses—functions as crucible. Environmental details evolve causally; acid reacts with etched brass to produce new light spectra. One missed beat: exact spatial relation between workshop pontoons and bay door is vague, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transliterate violence into vision and transcend mechanical purpose—is signaled early and tightens through each kaleidoscopic rotation. The final dive narrows options irreversibly; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible on the page: acid contact should corrode but instead rewrites her wings, a permanent forfeiture of factory-standard safety. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; however, the external chorus pressure is weak, keeping score below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transliteration conceit: predator/prey symmetry, violence re-coded as vision. The final image—equations in toxic sky—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is carried by the arrow tip’s shifting reflections and the unspoken fear of the other gliders. No thematic echo in dialogue; insight arises from concrete action. Ambiguity lingers: is transcendence collective or solitary?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, metallic yet lyrical: “brass wings clicking against chains,” “molten ambition.” Syntax mirrors mechanical precision with occasional bursts of flight. POV remains tight third-person limited to Pioneer; no head-hopping. Dialogue from Sprocket is spare and gear-grinding, contrasting Pioneer’s prism-dense diction. One register drift: “survival equation” momentarily slips into academic diction, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences vary in length to match tension. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Figurative language is controlled—acid “bubbling green expanse” is fresh yet exact. One mixed metaphor: “yearning algorithm pulsed through copper veins like molten ambition” fuses liquid and code, but the image is brief and does not blur causality. Final paragraph maintains clarity and rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—mechanical cart glider transcends via kaleidoscopic transliteration of a hunter’s arrow—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes (steampunk workshop, acid sea) are transformed through specific material logic. Risk-taking succeeds: acid does not dissolve but collaborates, rewriting physics without late rule change. Fresh inflection: the arrow tip becomes both instrument and theorem. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
