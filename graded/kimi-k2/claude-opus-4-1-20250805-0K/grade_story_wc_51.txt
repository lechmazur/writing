<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile handling of the lamp burner, the seventeen-gram memory, and the whale-bone reverie all reveal contradictory impulses (to stay/leave, to weave/renounce). The final smile and the cooling brass crystallize an earned stasis that forecloses escape yet accepts its cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added “weight” thickens pattern density until the grotto’s own mass is folded into the fractal. Closure is a Charged Poise—the crystallized whale-bone structure plus the cooling lamp reconfigure meaning without leaving the threshold. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, starlight angles, and the lamp burner’s brass weight are not backdrop but active constraints—orientation angles literally enable or disable weavings. The final image of starlight on cooling brass recharges every prior sensory cue. Micro-setting (lamp as anchor) qualifies and constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—collecting burdens until the grotto’s own mass must be assumed—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each new weight narrows Mara's options until the final calcification forecloses escape. Cost is visible in the warming-then-cooling lamp and the smile that costs her months of silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of weight-as-memory emerges from concrete particulars (17 g of brass, whale-bone arches) without abstract statement. Final image reweights the premise: the prison is self-woven, the freedom is acceptance. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the shingled hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors fractal recursion (“split and reformed endlessly”). Perceptual signature is distinct—Mara notices angles, oxidation patterns, gravitational frequencies. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Metaphors (whale ribs, suspended pearls) are coherent and payoff-linked. No loops or scaffold; minor register elevation (“prehistoric patience”) is earned by voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of magical weaving into a meditation on mass and memory; the bronze grotto as recursive container feels fresh. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final crystallized image. Specificity throughout prevents generic drift.</comment>
