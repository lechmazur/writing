<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s grief and guilt are embodied in the hollow mirror shard and his tremulous voice, but the Arbiter remains a cipher—no interior contradiction or micro-choice undercuts his authority, so the relationship never becomes a crucible. The final “terrible gift” lands as a conceptual cost rather than a felt one for the Arbiter, capping the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus is left holding the shard that now reflects “gray spaces,” a charged poise that reweights his moral stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers nuance until the final image crystallizes it—but the Arbiter’s exit feels slightly schematic, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse beam, wind chimes, and salt air are vivid and selective, but only the mirror shard constrains choice. The setting supports mood more than tactics; the beacon is backdrop, not tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Marcus’s need to understand his complicity—tightens when the Arbiter reframes “simplicity” as the killer. One clear deepening, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mirror shard’s final reflection and the wind-chime testimony; no moral is stated. The gray-light image reweights the premise with quiet force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct, controlled lyricism—“sincerely insincere,” “designer uncertainty”—anchors the Arbiter’s voice. Dialogue carries subtext; no POV drift. Minor register wobble in “market necessities” line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; only one paraphrase loop (“simply successful, simply generous”) and a near-mixed metaphor (“cloak of doubt…pulling at the shoulders”) mar the rhythm. Otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “conscience for hire” conceit freshens the grief-parable; the wind chimes as moral archive is inventive. Risk is moderate—no structural daring—but the synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
