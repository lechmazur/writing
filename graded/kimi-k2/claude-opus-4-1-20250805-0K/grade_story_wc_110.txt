<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—protecting Marcus vs. exposing Samuel—are dramatized in the eavesdropping confession and the doodled tickets; the final hand-hold earns the thaw with visible relational cost. Samuel’s off-stage protection of Marcus is credibly inferred yet still feels slightly outline-like. Interiority is embodied and specific, avoiding label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens on the ledge gathering equal rain and moonlight crystallizes the new, fragile trust. Causal chain—doodles → meeting → mutual confession → hand-hold—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt’s acoustic properties literally amplify whispers into music, constraining how secrets can be spoken and heard; the lens and puddles recur as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—tightens when Mira admits her own misdirection, foreclosing the option of continued silence. Pressure escalates through the revealed confessions; cost is the shared vulnerability of the hand-hold under moonlight. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transparency vs. distortion emerges organically from the lens motif and the mutual confessions; the final image reframes “ambiguously clear” without moralizing. Subtext in doodles and silence carries weight. Emotional aftereffect lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to resonant echo. POV stays tightly with Mira; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature in noticing “trapped moonlight” and “broken promises” in scratched glass.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“crystalline walls reflecting whispers back as harmonics”) fits the registrar’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The museum-night tryst with doodled tickets feels fresh; the lens-as-truth motif is transformed through tactile handling and final reweighting. Specific institutional detail grounds the premise. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off.</comment>
