<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta’s empathetically decisive trait is dramatized through her polyglot singing and pendulum rigging; the contradictory pull between private grief and communal hope is embodied in her chest-cavity vibration. Interiority stays concrete (“practiced grace,” “stored memories of abundance”) and avoids label-speak. The final choice—descending to join neighbors—earns its cost by the overnight labor and the irrevocable shift from isolation to chorus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the elevators’ dawn chorus reweights the town’s social fabric with audible cost—the irrevocable loss of silence. Causal chain holds: Marta’s pendulum rig → harmonic alignment → linguistic bridge → cooperative harvest plan. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“prairie sky…grain elevators below”) and sustained. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The clock tower’s brass gears and resonance chamber actively amplify Marta’s voice, constraining tactics and charging the final image. Grain elevators function as both setting and character, their “corrugated walls acting like enormous vocal cords.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and urgent; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tower to fields. Weather and starlight evolve causally with the overnight arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rehabilitate the dying district—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the first bass note makes her chest vibrate, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is driven by Marta’s agency under Accumulative lens: each added elevator voice increases density and communal stakes. Cost is visceral (loss of silence, overnight exhaustion) and legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of linguistic harmony as social repair emerges organically from the elevators’ polyglot song; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from “empty monuments” to “active participants.” Final image of the swinging weight reweights the premise: time and sound as communal heartbeat. Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“brass gears clicking in counterpoint,” “acoustic bridges between farms”—sustained without purple drift. POV remains tightly focalized through Marta; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“Ja, yes, oui”) are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; final paragraph crystallizes voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise (“steel shells resonating,” “time signatures in the air”) and never muddle causality. Syntax varies naturally; no filter-verb stacks. Clean mechanics and consistent tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—grain elevators as polyglot choir—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test: swapping elevators for any other structure would collapse the story. Specificity of prairie acoustics, Black Forest weight, and multilingual frequencies creates freshness without gimmickry. Risk-taking (singing architecture) heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
