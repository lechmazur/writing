<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thessaly’s centuries-long vigil and Marina’s immediate empathy create a believable crucible; the telepathic exchange is embodied, not abstract, and the final “animate with possibility” crystallizes a credible internal shift with visible cost—the statue’s new purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each memory-thread tightens the moral vise until Marina’s ascent reconfigures both women’s futures; the closure beat (“Below the waves…new purpose”) is an Earned Stasis that forecloses vengeance and carries centuries of weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned garden is tactile—kelp threading marble, foxglove residue glowing—and the statue’s stone body functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice; final image of “stone animate” charges the entire frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether truth will damn or redeem—escalates with each memory Thessaly threads; Marina’s refusal to condemn narrows options to acceptance, and the cost is the shattering of her life’s work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: moral complexity refracted through purple poison; no tidy moral, only the resonant reweighting that “history isn’t black and white—it’s purple.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; Thessaly’s telepathic register is distinct from Marina’s interiority, and the rhythmic control under pressure (“dominoes falling upward through time”) never sacrifices clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density; figurative language is selective and purposeful, e.g., “kelp forests thread through marble archways” does double sensory and symbolic work without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a paralyzed garden-keeper turned telepathic war-crime witness offers a non-obvious moral calculus; the foxglove ampoule as both literal poison and metaphor for nuanced history feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
