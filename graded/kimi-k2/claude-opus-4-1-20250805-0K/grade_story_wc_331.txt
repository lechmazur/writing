<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured—his ritual tracing of spines, the scarf as memory conduit—but the “sanely eccentric” label is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is forced into costly choice. The final recognition is resonant yet feels gifted by the library rather than earned through a prior micro-choice that visibly costs him something.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s infinite topology crystallizes in a charged poise that reweights memory and story. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory and conceptual pattern tightens toward the final image—but the cost is conceptual rather than embodied; no concrete forfeiture is dramatized on Marcus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The non-Euclidean library is rendered with tactile specificity—aisle seven-and-a-half, breathing shelves, hyperbolic curves traced in air—and this setting actively constrains Marcus’s movement and discovery. The scarf as micro-setting also charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to find the place where stories live”—is signaled early and deepens through pattern accumulation. A single tightening occurs when marginalia in his grandmother’s handwriting forces a conceptual reweighting, but the escalation is driven more by setting revelation than by Marcus’s agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-topology emerges organically from concrete particulars; the final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (unhooking the scarf “as if apologizing to an old friend”) is subtle and character-specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a mathematician-poet’s perceptual signature—“equations bloomed into verse”—and rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Marcus’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. Minor scaffold appears (“the library reorganized itself subtly, shelves breathing like lungs”) yet does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses scientific poetry library with hyperbolic memory-space in a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The risk of non-Euclidean architecture is fully committed to and heightens stakes without gimmickry; the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
