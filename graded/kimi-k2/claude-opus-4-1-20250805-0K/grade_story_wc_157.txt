<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s quiet, embodied resolve—releasing locusts as “rain” while smiling at the Auditors—shows contradictory impulses (protective caretaker vs. defiant saboteur) with visible cost. Serena’s rogue charm is more label than lived contradiction, but her micro-choice to pocket the seed under pressure still tilts the relationship. The final stance crystallizes with felt risk: Marcus stands guard knowing capture may come, yet the garden network survives—Earned Stasis with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Auditors burst in, but the seed is already gone, the gardens already planted—Marcus’s smile reweights the premise; thoughts may be taxed, but photosynthetic language cannot be. Causal chain holds: wing-beat interference → scanner crash → tunnel escape → city-wide pattern activation. One transition (tunnel) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s humid glass, beetle-track script, and “ten thousand wings” are vivid, selective, and filtered through Marcus’s professional eye. The locust swarm functioning as “rain” on scanners constrains the final choice and charges the image. Spatial choreography is tight: door rattles, tunnel opens, seed travels—no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protecting the secret language network—tightens when Auditors triangulate Sector Seven. Escalation is causal: scanner squeal → locust release → tunnel exit → gardens already planted. Cost is legible: Marcus’s imminent capture versus the network’s survival. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “Consciousness is not commodity” is spelled in basil, not stated. Final image—wing-beats as untaxable thought—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Serena’s seed-handoff and Marcus’s locust “rain” carries the revolution in gesture, not slogan.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s perceptual signature—scientific precision laced with lyrical awe—remains distinct under pressure. Sentence rhythm modulates: longer, humid clauses calm, then staccato beats as Auditors pound. Dialogue is spare, subtextual (“Fashionably so,” “Plant the pattern”). No head-hopping; focalization stays locked.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the greenhouse hummed with ten thousand wings” does triple duty (setting, theme, threat). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs—“scrambled,” “warp,” “crystallized”—carry load without modifiers. Final line “Even chaos, after all, followed its own grammar” lands as earned cadence, not ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insect wing-beats as encryption, vegetables as samizdat, photosynthesis as rebellion. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet wholly new. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final “rain” image. No template echo; the ecosystem-as-resistance angle is specific and transformative.</comment>
