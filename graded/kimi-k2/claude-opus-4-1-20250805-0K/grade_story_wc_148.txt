<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory need to bear witness yet remain invisible is embodied in every beat—hovering is literal and metaphorical; the final statement as “True-Tongue” is earned by prior discovery of the bones. Interiority is specific but leans on summary (“father’s obsessions”) rather than embodied contradiction under live stress, nudging down.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Acculative lens holds: copper tint → discovery of bones → truth woven into lattice. Closure reconfigures meaning—lighthouse now holds truth, not lies—felt cost in Marcus’s lifelong imprisonment acknowledged on page ("lived his entire life behind bars"). One causal hiccup: journal reveal is too perfectly timed, yet the final image sustains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting as crucible: scuffed brass plate and salt-rusted cell anchor pressure, lattice salvaged “from a shipwreck” becomes a literal weave of confession. Environment constrains every move; lighthouse basement with bones reconfigures the stakes. A slight drift toward picturesque copper light is offset by its function as both revelation and prison.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth for the twenty-three—spelled early; pressure tightens via ticking boat arrival. Escalation is accretive rather than cusp-based, but the final testimony crystallizes cost. One off-page turn is accepted under accumulative lens; still, the wolves-redeemer moment lacks visceral resistance at climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges seamlessly: a confession-less confessional that finally permits testimony. Emergence rather than speechifying; last images of copper light and renamed father carry non-verbal reweighting. Nearly marred by the phrase “Truth lives in the spaces between heartbeats,” but recovered by embodied lattice inscription.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distorted, salt-stiff diction belongs to Marcus: “threading his way into the corridor like smoke through a keyhole” is texture-true. Compression is purposeful; no POV stray. Occasional poetic overload (“hover-carved itself into wood”) stays within allowed stylization because taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: rhythmic variation, minimal loops, no scaffold. A rare purple phrase (“amber repose, peaceful despite the horrors”) grazes overwriting but does not cloud the final image. Clarity and propulsion sustained through peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Daring twist—famed fable retold as false accusation—elevates it, but premise still rides on the shoulders of folklore. Fresh use of hover-lattice and impossible conception add specificity. Bold without gimmickry; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
