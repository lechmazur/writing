<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tears freeze on her cheeks, fingers dance silently across keys—yet her contradictory impulses (grief vs. discovery) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of “lost music” is earned by the thermal symphony she has witnessed, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s realization that she has “simply learned its secret language” crystallizes the stake and carries conceptual cost—the irreversibility of her deafness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each thermal pattern layers density until the final image reweights silence itself. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is not mere backdrop; its 62 Hz floor vibration and refracted aurora actively shape Mira’s method and final stance. The tuning fork case and thermal monitors function as micro-settings that constrain every choice. The setting’s specificity—transparent walls, frost vines, Arctic night—charges the closing image of “quiet fire.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music via thermal patterns—is signaled early and tightened through each experiment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira recognizes the plants are “composing,” narrowing her options from passive observation to active transcription. Cost is visible in frozen tears and the irreversible absence of sound, though it could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: loss as gateway to unheard forms of beauty. The thermal “sheet music” reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Final image of “quiet fire” offers non-literal resonance, reweighting silence from deficit to medium. No thematic drift; every detail serves the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Mira’s silent world: “crystallized breath,” “prismatic symphonies.” Perceptual signature is consistent—temperature as melody, frost as notation. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Compression and elision (“three months had passed”) are taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual information. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “thermal symphony”) fits the scientific lyric mode. No loops or scaffold; metaphors remain coherent. Minor register drift in “vocabulary of thermal response” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—plants composing in degrees of warmth—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Synthesizes Indigenous plant-spirit lore with hard science through Mira’s embodied practice. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
