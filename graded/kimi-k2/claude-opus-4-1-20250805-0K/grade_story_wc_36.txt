<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Kessa’s contradictory urge to return not for redemption but understanding embodies the story; embodied tremor, driftwood marking, and the canyon breath deepen interiority. The failure-mandated shift “guardianship ended… role just begun” crystallizes with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Drives under Accumulative/Textural lens: prior six-month failure accumulates pressure as silence deepens until the new braided song reweights the threshold from wall to doorway. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the seed of light settling behind sternum—so the choice’s price resonates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Avalanchingly quiet mountains” and shimmering winter-heat canyon become felt constraints; driftwood markers track movement while silence itself becomes an active presence pressing eardrums, guiding the final image toward the seed exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learn how failure redefines guardianship—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as each woven note renounces sealing and forces a confrontation with Other Place inhabitant, tightening choices until the doorway must be accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of failed separation yields emergent synthesis: thresholds as dance partners, not enemies, is never sermonized but dramatized through tonal braid between worlds. The mountains’ final whisper reframes silence from judgment to benediction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Achingly sustained free-indirect hymn sustains focal weight; perceptual signature filters every detail through tremor and peripheral gold threads. Compression across line-breaks (“played the new song… braiding”) tightens without clarity loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with descending driftwood and ascending seed, zero loops; metaphors (“membrane’s permeability… halt the tide with her hands”) are precise and earned. Minor density in opening two descriptors (“gilded reed flute”) prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms stock portal guardian via recontextualized failure as generative doorway; non-monstrous Other inhabitant upends expectation. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, yet absence of further risk keeps score at ceiling short of 9+.</comment>
