<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is concrete—scarred fingers, dream-logic hands, inherited craft—yet her contradictory impulses (duty vs. fatigue) remain under-dramatized; the final renunciation of rest carries visible cost in “knowing tomorrow would bring another net,” earning a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spirits’ settling reweights the premise, cost is legible in Mira’s dawn exhaustion. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each knot’s unraveling deepens pattern until starlight crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary’s crystal ceiling literally focuses starlight to illuminate the final masks, constraining the restoration ritual; micro-setting (workbench, hemp fibers) is tactile and biased by Mira’s craft. Sensory hierarchy favors salt-black hemp and fractured moonlight, grounding the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the drowned—tightens as each knot forecloses Mira’s rest. Agency is her endurance; cost is bodily fatigue and future obligation. One meaningful deepening when the net fully unravels, no reversals needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance-as-repair emerges through concrete ritual; no moralizing. Final image of masks glowing silver offers non-literal answer: brokenness becomes monument. Subtext in the “interlaced hush” charges the closure without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, salt-stained. Perceptual signature filters moonlight through prisms and hemp. No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned elision (“lucid unrest”) is taught early and paid off in the dawn fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“sleeping serpent,” “jellyfish made of starlight”) are precise, never mixed. High information density—each sentence advances restoration or atmosphere. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: funeral masks + drowned sailors’ net as restorative thread feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric ritualism pays off; no derivative echoes. Specificity of 1674 storm and porcelain scales anchors universals.</comment>
