<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her cataloguing of “small wrongnesses” and the tactile warmth of the orris root crystallize her perceptual signature. The final choice to leave the shard is earned by her accumulating recognition of the houses’ grief and her own role as witness. One minor slip: the phrase “inadvertently profound” is authorial summary rather than embodied realization, blunting the cost momentarily.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina’s placement of the shard reweights the entire pattern of displaced objects and sanctification. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each small migration accrues until the final image crystallizes the cost of witness. No orientation drift; bay, streetlights, and houses are anchored early and return charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bay as “held breath” and the orris root shard as micro-setting both constrain Marina’s final choice; the quiet itself becomes a tactile force. Sensory selection is biased to her noticing—violet warmth, migrating mailbox—so every detail serves POV and stakes. One hairline slip: “blazed through her consciousness” edges toward cliché, but the surrounding hush rescues it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—tightens when Marina sees the offerings through the shard. The deepening is her recognition that the houses sanctify themselves by giving away pieces of life; this narrows her options to witness or participate. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the shard, accepting perpetual outsider-witness status.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: grief and love alter matter until even walls learn to embrace absence. The final image of the bay “cradling its displaced treasures like prayers” offers a non-literal answer—sanctification through quiet relinquishment. No moralizing; the resonance is earned by the pattern of small sacrifices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“cartographer of the imperceptible,” “crystallized hush”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the slow drift of objects. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marina notices angles of migration, temperature of scent, silence as active presence. No POV leakage; every observation is filtered through her patient, grieving attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“repository of hush,” “molecular structure of a place”) is justified by lyric mode and pattern-taught early. No loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s cadence shift to short, declarative clauses lands the closure cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—houses slowly sanctifying themselves through displaced objects—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Synthesis of grief, architecture, and quiet is specific to this voice; remove any detail and the emotional logic collapses. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: the quiet itself becomes character, charging the final image.</comment>
