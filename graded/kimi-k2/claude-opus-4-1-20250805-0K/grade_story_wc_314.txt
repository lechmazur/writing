<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interior contradiction—sentimentality vs. pure reason—is embodied in the micro-choice to sublimate the crystal; the cost (loss of preserved wonder) is legible and scales to the word count. Backstory is anchored in present cues and tilts her stance. No secondary character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vapor rising reconfigures the stakes—tomorrow’s Synthesis will succeed because she has released, not captured, wonder. Causal chain (crystal → flame → vapor → insight) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orchard, waterfall, and spiral pear trees constrain her choice to sublimate rather than hoard the crystal; the “ancient freshness” charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory selection is POV-biased and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she preserve or release wonder—tightens once when the starlings’ pattern forces the insight that leads to the flame. Cost is the irreversible loss of the crystal; escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: translation between logic and intuition. Final vapor image offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—controlled compression, patterned elision (“centuries and morning simultaneously”)—taught early and paid off. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density, zero loops or scaffold, rhythm breathes with scene pressure. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemy as translation, starlings as living formula. Spiral pear trees and crystallized wonder are specific inventions. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring closure.</comment>
