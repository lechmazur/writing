<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s involuntary truth-telling is embodied in every compulsive confession; the moment she tests silence after drinking the cure lands with visible cost. Interior contradiction—yearning for honesty yet craving mercy—drives each micro-choice. The final resolve to “speak sideways” is earned by the prior crucible of ruined relationships and the literal price of the tincture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change: the compulsion lifts, choice returns, and the cost is the burden of choosing when to speak. Causal chain—rake strikes box → truffles → tincture → silence—holds without gaps. The hanging orchard’s sway under lightning crystallizes the earned poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ravine’s storm-bent apple trees and metallic thunder constrain movement and mood; the orchard’s horizontal growth literalizes “sideways” survival. The glass eye’s shift in the tincture charges the final image. Sensory selection (copper rain, green verdigris) is filtered through Mara’s urgent priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mara regain the power to withhold truth?—is signaled early and tightened when the tin box offers both hope and evidence of prior desperation. The single reversal (compulsion lifted) carries a felt price: the ethical burden of discretion. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between honesty and mercy; the hanging orchard’s sideways growth becomes a non-literal answer to how truth might bend without breaking. No moralizing—just the charged image of the now-clouded eye clicking like dice. Subtext resides in what Mara no longer has to say.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and character-bound: “earth and copper and something older.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short bursts during the storm, longer ruminative lines in calmer beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“trees swaying like hanged men” mirrors stakes without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with the storm and breathes after the cure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus premise is transformed through Mara’s specific, embodied plight and the discredited Victorian cure. The sideways orchard and glass-eye tincture feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (lyric compression, speculative science) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
