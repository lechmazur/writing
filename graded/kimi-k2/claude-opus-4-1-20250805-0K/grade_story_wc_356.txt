<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s olfactory sensitivity and ambition are embodied in every beat—she smells soil acidity, fungal threat, the flower’s dreams—yet her interiority never slips into label-speak. The final sway with the village, breathing the stench she once feared, is a credible renunciation of her old rush toward mastery and carries visible cost. Only the elders remain off-page archetypes, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes in the final sway, cost paid by enduring the stench she once reviled. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sketches, smells, and swaying motion tightens until the last image reweights the premise. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The treetop village is no postcard; its sway constrains every choice—Mira learns to “cultivate serenity within motion.” The corpse-flower’s suspended garden, soil from lightning strikes, and dew from spider webs are tactile, selective, and charged in the final bloom. Micro-setting (seed-wrapping paper) doubles as ancestral archive, constraining her method and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastering patience under motion—is signaled early and tightens through sensory escalation: each smell she endures forecloses the option to rush. The turning of the tide’s thought marks the single deepening that reweights her tactics. Cost is visceral: she breathes the “overwhelming, beautiful, and terrible” stench in public witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the corpse flower’s stench as communication, not corruption, reweights the premise without moralizing. The final image—Mira swaying, rooted at last—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how knowledge flows beneath action. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in olfactory synesthesia: “putrid-sweet promise,” “smell its dreams like thunder before rain.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, urgent clauses during breakthrough; longer, swaying cadences at closure. No POV leakage; even Master Thorne’s single line carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, motion, or lineage. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “The village creaked around her in the wind, a living thing” compresses setting and emotion in one stroke. Minor elevation in diction (“olfactorily”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The corpse-flower-as-teacher trope is transformed through sensory apprenticeship and ancestral sketch-journals. The treetop village’s sway as pedagogical constraint feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final image of communal sway amid magnificent stench is fresh, earned, and unforgettable.</comment>
