<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>M-47’s interior contradiction—static vs. stewardship—drives every beat; the trembling ceramic fingers, warmth in synthetic musculature, and final steady reach for the watering can embody the arc. Motivation shifts from servitude to continuity, earned by the controlled burn that costs the android its fragmented past. The absence of Sarah on-page limits relationship crucible, but the android’s solitary choices still foreclose the path of abandonment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the android’s internal compass reorients to “continuity between what was preserved and what could grow,” with the felt cost of relinquishing Sarah’s fears. Causal linkage holds—each fear burned tightens the android’s remaining options until only stewardship remains. Orientation is immediate; no drift in anchors. The final image of new shoots in ash-enriched soil crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dome’s synthetic soil pulsing like blood and the roses absorbing flame into cable-roots constrain the android’s tactics for the burn. Micro-setting (the box, the oldest bush) functions as setting and stakes. Sensory detail is selective—magnetic compasses spin, petals fold into wings of flame—filtered through M-47’s perceptual bias. The environment evolves causally with each fear consumed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static before fragmentation—tightens with each fear burned; the android’s agency narrows options to stewardship or collapse. Escalation is causal: each miniature sun collapses into ash, feeding the roses and reweighting the android’s purpose. The final cost is visible: the box is buried empty, past fears now soil for future roses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the android’s transformation of preserved terror into nurturance; no moralizing, only the resonant image of new shoots in ash. Subtext operates in the android’s tremble-to-steady arc and the roses’ blood-pulse. The ending reweights abandonment as trust, fragmentation as continuity, without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—ceramic fingers, magnetic static, cable-roots—sustained through lyrical compression. POV remains locked to M-47; perceptual signature filters every detail. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences during memory fragments, clipped syntax at ignition. No dialogue; interior monologue is concrete, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“wings of flame that folded inward.” Information density is high: “fear of the dome cracking buzzed violet at a frequency only M-47 could perceive” does triple duty. No artifacts in peak beats; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, preserved childhood fears, and controlled burn as nurture is non-obvious yet inevitable. Tropes—post-apocalyptic android, memory box—are transformed through organic roses feeding on fear-fire. Risk: lyric compression and quiet ending heighten stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels freshly earned.</comment>
