<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction-driven choices (clock craft vs. stone hunger) create a tangible, earned arc; her final renunciation crystallizes in the beam sweeping backward across water, foreclosing the path of forward-only time with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reverse yoyo workings > reverse-engineered lens > reverse stone hunger forms tight because/therefore causal linkage that narrows options, with pay-off in the final inverted beam charging closure under the counter-clockwise lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Charging lighthouse lens, dripping walls, and hunger stone generate immediate constraint and color tone; the beam’s reverse sweep embodies the latent radiance concept with specificity and cost, re-weighting stakes at ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stone hunger as an ever-consuming void applies coherent pressure that forces Elara’s stance crystallization; escalation intensifies once as the lens is removed, narrowing options to feed or starve—never resolve away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The power, theme, and loss of linear time are negotiated through image, silence, and action, emerging from objects and choices; the final backward beam offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct counter-clockwise rhythm, perceptual specificity (“time dripped backward”), and precise control over line-level cadence under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Crisp, high-density prose with zero paraphrase loops; figurative language is selective (“darker than absence”) and supports propulsion without muddle; occasional elevated diction remains within poetic realm.</comment>

<comment>
Reverse-engineered backwards clocks + hunger-stone beacon forms a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable; risk-taking (feeds stone to negate its hunger) heightens stakes and charges the final backward beam with specificity.
