<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on the compass, the warmth, the remembered voice—but the “blessed pariah” label is asserted rather than dramatized. The shift from curse to compass is credible, yet the cost (touching others stretches them) is stated more than felt. Her final choice to become a lighthouse is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira’s map re-orients the station’s lost souls, crystallizing her new role as Polaris. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery (compass, sketching, stars) tightens until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is taught early; the void where stars used to be cues disorientation that pays off. Cost is legible in her isolation and the irreversible stretching of others.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observation deck’s crystalline walls and recycled air are tactile, while the gilded compass constrains choice and charges the final image. Micro-setting (rice paper, charcoal) functions as navigational tool. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kira’s navigator priorities; spatial choreography is clear. The vanished stars and temporal dilation are consistent world rules learned through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightened through Kira’s sketching. Agency is exercised in the final act of mapping; the cost is her continued solitude and the irreversible effect on others. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the stretching is a compass, not a curse. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: navigation as mutual orientation, home as a fixed point you become for others. Subtext operates in the silence and the remembered voice. The final image of starlight remembered in gold reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is embraced—blessing and curse coexist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“echoed silence,” “time pulled thin like taffy”). Perceptual signature is navigator-obsessed: “each star positioned with a navigator’s obsession for accuracy.” No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“time pulled thin like taffy” fits the temporal theme. Rhythm modulates with pressure; short, urgent clauses under stress. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of star-mapping, temporal dilation, and inherited navigation tools feels fresh and inevitable. The premise is non-obvious yet fully committed. Specific details (rice paper from Earth, gilded compass from an ancient ship) ground the concept. Risk-taking in structure and lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
