<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s gait-reading, coin-carrying, and layered-map habit all crystallize in the final transfer of the coin to Chen, showing earned authority and visible cost. His quiet challenge and twelve-year knowledge anchor every micro-choice; the only slip is a touch of explanatory ease when he “interrupts softly” to reveal Chen’s own lunch route. Interiority stays embodied and specific, never drifting into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Chen concedes the whispers’ power and Marcus relinquishes the coin, foreclosing his lone-guru path. Causal linkage holds—storm disables tech → only Marcus can navigate → coin becomes proof of concept. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. The final beat reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Container labyrinth, aurora glare, and brass-key resonance all constrain navigation choices and charge the ending image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the metallic groaning and spinning compasses narrow perception under crisis. Micro-setting (hollow vs. loaded containers) directly guides route selection. Environment and tool jointly shape tactics and final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers outrun shouts”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when GPS failure forces reliance on Marcus’s quiet knowledge. Agency is crystallized in the coin hand-off, which costs Marcus his leverage and reconfigures power. Pressure escalates because the storm disables every fallback except Marcus’s embodied skill; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: patient, embodied knowledge outperforms institutional noise. Subtext resides in gait, echo, and graffiti marks rather than statement. Final image—Chen holding the warm coin—reweights the premise without moralizing. The story invites reflection on how systems learn to listen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual signature: “hurried shuffle,” “metallic groaning,” “aurora painted green fire.” Syntax flexes with pressure—longer sentences for mapping, staccato taps for key beats. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Chen’s cracked voice carries subtext. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or advances tactic. Figurative language is selective (“aurora painted green fire”) and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + shipping-container maze + gait-recognition as navigation tech. Tropes of lone seer and institutional blindness are transformed through tactile port detail and acoustic science. Risk—quiet victory over loud authority—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
