<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra’s contradictory impulses—empathic pull vs. self-protective retreat—are dramatized in the moment he chooses to approach the woman; the cost (absorbing her grief) is embodied and visible. Interiority is specific, not diagnostic, and the final micro-choice to share the invitation crystallizes his arc. Minor slip: the phrase “enlarged tranquility” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the midnight stillness reconfigures both characters’ isolation into shared solitude, with the cost of ongoing empathic burden legible in the final image. Causal chain holds—late invitation → self-taught hiding → teaching another—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The impossible library above a train station is sketched with selective sensory cues (crumpled paper, telegram creases) that constrain choices—secrecy demands silence, architecture allows hidden corners. Micro-setting (table between them) becomes the charged space where distance is negotiated. One stray: “impossible architecture” is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear unbearable empathy—tightens once when Ezra decides to stay present yet apart. The deepening is his offer of paradoxical comfort; cost is the fresh wave of grief he absorbs. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (late telegram) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: compassion through self-denial, wisdom in error. Subtext lives in gesture—folding the telegram to match the invitation’s creases—without moralizing. Final image of shared silence reweights the premise without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, slightly archaic, consistent with a secretive scholar; perceptual signature filters every detail through empathic hypersensitivity. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences in reflection, clipped during the approach. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Minor elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) is voice-motivated and rare. Strong nouns and verbs throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The empathic recluse in a paradox-worshipping library feels fresh; tropes are inverted—solitude as service, lateness as perfect timing. Specificity of the telegram-folding gesture transforms generic grief into singular moment. Risky structure (quiet shared stillness) pays off.</comment>
