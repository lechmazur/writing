<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but abstract; the veiled dreamer's motives (find the library, document dreams) are declared rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses surface under pressure—she proceeds with calm certainty. The final self-recognition arrives as elegant CR yet lacks prior dramatized struggle to feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the dreamer realizes she is both seeker and keeper, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition and documentation drive the shift. The cost is conceptual (eternal custodianship) and legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glowing library-mist is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: the propagation delays between shelves directly constrain how information is accessed, shaping the dreamer’s tactics. The watch and journal act as additional “settings” that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the library of unspoken words—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the tightening pattern of delays and the backward-ticking watch; the deepening comes when documentation reveals the library is self-created. Cost is conceptual custodianship rather than visceral, but still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—the power of unspoken words in the pause—emerges organically from the propagation-delay mechanic and the dreamer’s act of documentation. The final image of her notes seeding future dreamers offers resonant non-literal closure. No moralizing; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific: “symbols that shifted when she wasn’t looking directly at them.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. The compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly controlled; occasional figurative layering (“consciousness folding like origami”) edges toward density without muddling causality. No loops or scaffold. Strong rhythmic variation; information density is high. One mixed metaphor (“trapped constellations”) slightly blurs clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The library of unspoken words accessed via propagation delays is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The watch that ticks backward to reveal ciphered silence repurposes a familiar trope with conceptual rigor. Risky lyric structure holds together and charges the final image.</comment>
