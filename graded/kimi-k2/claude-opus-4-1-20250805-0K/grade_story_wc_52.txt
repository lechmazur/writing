<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margaret’s interiority is embodied and specific—her knife “finds the wood’s heart with hauntingly practical precision” shows inherited muscle memory. The contradiction between grief and purposeful action is dramatized in micro-choices (carving numerals that “aren’t quite numbers”). The final renunciation—teaching workshops instead of clinging to relics—earns its cost through prior beats. Only the slight drift into reflective summary near the end keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain, ash scent, steam) tightens the emotional density until the clock face crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Margaret’s stance toward time and loss is reweighted in the final image of the clock that “would never tell time, only hold it.” Cost is legible in the line “moving with” rather than “moving on.” One micro-turn—the kettle’s rising whistle—compresses the arc without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The loft’s rain-beaded skylight and kettle’s countdown function as micro-setting that constrains action: steam mingles with wood scent, whistle forces the final cuts. Spatial anchors are immediate and tactile. The ash blank’s grain is rendered through Margaret’s trained eye, not catalogued. Only the brief exterior zoo memory drifts from the immediate sensorium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to carry love after death—tightens via the carving’s progression from blank to charged object. Pressure escalates as the kettle’s whistle nears, forcing the decisive cuts. The cost is the acceptance that presence persists as influence, not possession. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ash wood’s transformation: love crystallizes into artifact without ossifying. The clock without hands becomes a non-literal answer to how time holds loss. Subtext operates in the numerals that “aren’t quite numbers” and the steam that rises “here and gone, but the warmth remained.” No moralizing—just charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is Margaret’s perceptual signature—botanical illustrator’s eye meets carver’s tactile precision. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective sentences contract into “She carved faster now, not rushed but purposeful.” No dialogue, so internal coherence carries the load. The lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: “ash wood released its sharp, clean scent, mixing with the steam” does triple sensory duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is spare and precise—“circles that contain a life” lands without overwriting. Only one near-cliché (“tears that wouldn’t fall”) but it’s filtered through Margaret’s resistance to sentiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The widow-carver premise is familiar, yet the clock-without-hands twist and the “crystallized time” conceit feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of botanical-illustrator-meets-carver lens freshens the trope. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but it earns its poise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
