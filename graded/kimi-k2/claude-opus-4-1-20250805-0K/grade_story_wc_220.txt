<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage’s shift from corpse-tracker to living-finder is embodied and earned; the leaf’s pull and her howl crystallize the cost of renewed purpose. Interiority stays concrete—scarred muzzle, failing eyes—without therapy-speak. One-armed Kemp supplies brief but effective status pressure. The only drag is a touch of summary in “she understood then,” blunting the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Sage’s howl reweights her retirement into summons, cost paid in the reopening of vocation. Causal chain—leaf → phonograph → magnetic path → valley—holds cleanly. Orientation is swift; Heap, den, and wasteland are anchored by line 3. No lens ambiguity; causal drive stays dominant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crushed-auto towers, retrofitted container, and sterile valley are vivid, selective, and tied to choice: the Heap’s rust constrains travel, the valley’s impossible soil enables reunion. Sensory hierarchy favors Sage’s nose and failing sight. Micro-setting (amber leaf, phonograph grooves) charges the final image. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—tightens when the leaf’s veins become a map, forcing Sage to leave safety. Escalation is causal: each decoded color narrows her route and raises the cost of return. No external antagonist needed; grief itself supplies pressure. Final howl pays the price of renewed duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of loss-as-compass emerges organically from Sage’s journey; no moralizing. The waxed leaf reweights from relic to promise in the final valley image. Subtext in Kemp’s “wild hush” and the children’s silence carries more than dialogue could. Final howl offers non-literal answer: distance measured in grief can be bridged by shared calling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—weathered, scent-driven, war-cautious. Syntax mirrors Sage’s limping gait: “bloodhound’s scarred muzzle twitched… but Sage no longer trusted her nose.” No head-hopping; Kemp’s dialogue is spare, fitting a one-armed mechanic. Compression like “wild hush” teaches the pattern early and holds to the howl.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “tower-stacks of crushed automobiles,” “glass craters.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay physical—leaf glows like trapped sunlight—never purple. Rhythm accelerates across the three-night trek, then opens for the valley reveal. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bloodhound guided by grief-compass and chromatic leaf is fresh without gimmickry. The phonograph-as-reader and magnetic dog-sense feel inevitable once seeded. Transformation test: swap Sage for generic tracker and the arc collapses. Risky quiet ending lands with earned resonance.</comment>
