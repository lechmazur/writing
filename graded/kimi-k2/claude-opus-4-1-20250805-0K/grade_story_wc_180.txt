<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven refusal vs. granddaughter’s need—play out in embodied micro-choices (trembling hands, fumbling the bag). The final renunciation of her vow is earned by the orchard’s living proof that rigidity fails; cost is the reopening of grief and the risk of Council censure. Mira’s feistiness directly enables the mending; her tying the ribbon reconfigures their relationship. Interiority stays concrete, no therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “deciduous vow” falls away as Elara re-enters the guild’s work through Mira. Causal linkage holds: breach → orchard takeover → failing eyes → granddaughter’s pressure → mending → ribbon hand-off. Orientation is anchored within 120 words. Cost is explicit in the final image: “the Council won’t like this.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral is not backdrop; its roots threading stone constrain ladder placement and supply the only light for mending. Specificity is vivid—pear, apple, cherry named—and the setting evolves as each mended eye refracts color through blossoms, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the quartz eyes or lose patients’ sight forever. One meaningful tightening: Elara’s choice to break her vow after seeing the dying crystals. Escalation is causal—each healed eye brightens the orchard, raising the stakes visually. Cost is the reopened emotional wound and political risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom is living, not preserved. Subtext lives in the ribbon passing from dead mother to daughter to granddaughter, never stated. Final image—“the best wisdom usually arrives by accident”—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; every detail feeds the same question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “deciduous vows—like autumn leaves—were meant to fall away.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s cautious wonder; Mira’s dialogue is distinctively child-defiant. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara. Compression (“I packed the wrong bag”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “roots threading through stonework like determined fingers” does triple duty—image, character, theme. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Rhythm accelerates during mending, then breathes in the final exchange. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fusing a cathedral with a suspended orchard and crystalline eyes is fresh, yet every detail is grounded in sensory logic. The “deciduous vows” concept is not a gimmick; it shapes the entire plot arc. Transformation test: swapping names would gut the emotional specificity. Risky structure pays off.</comment>
