<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—clinging to an empty camera while yearning to translate silence—are embodied in every gesture; Chen’s quietly charismatic pressure forces Maya to risk exposure. The final renunciation (accepting silence as beginning) is earned by the prior mapping ritual and carries visible cost in their shared tears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: Maya’s nightly ritual → Chen’s challenge → collaborative translation → dawn acceptance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: “the silence felt like a beginning rather than an end,” with cost legible in the spent night and exposed archive.</comment>

<comment>Harbor moonlight and water serve as active metronome for the silent symphony; the Leica’s weight and the silver paths physically constrain framing choices. Final image recharges the mercury glow as witness to their secret concert.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming lost music—tightens when Chen demands the map; each shutter click escalates the cost of public failure. The decisive deepening is their joint performance at dawn, foreclosing solitary silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion: silence not as absence but as medium. Subtext in Chen’s wet eyes and Maya’s last click reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, tactile diction—“spilled mercury,” “gravitational pull of gesture”—remains inside Maya’s synesthetic perception. Sign-language dialogue is clean, rhythmic, and advances stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. No loops or mixed metaphors; cadence modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: sign-language symphonies translated back into silent photography. Risky inversion of loss into generative silence feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
