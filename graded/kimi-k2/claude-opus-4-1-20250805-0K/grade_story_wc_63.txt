<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theodore’s obsessive precision and guilt are embodied in the rake-handle litany; his final act of confession at the pendulum’s pause crystallizes a credible renunciation. Interiority is specific, but the shift from self-recrimination to communal restoration feels slightly smoothed rather than earned through visible friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s resumed swing reweights the village’s trust and Theodore’s accountability. Causal linkage holds—each inscribed name tightens the ethical cost—though the “pause in time” conceit is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, salt mist, and brass pendulum are vivid and selective; the ridge’s tidal scouring subtly mirrors Theodore’s eroded conscience. The tower’s interior space is cleanly tracked, but the ridge itself remains backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of communal temporal trust—escalates through the rake-handle confessions, each naming a measurable loss. The final tightening is the pendulum’s perfect swing, carrying visible social cost as fishermen nod in wordless recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges through the litany of seconds lost and regained; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image of the clock as “collective heartbeat” reweights prior material with quiet, non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, maritime, and slightly archaic without pastiche; perceptual signature shows in Theodore’s minute calibrations of guilt. Rhythm modulates under pressure, though a few sentences drift toward elevated cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sensory detail is purposeful, metaphors precise. No loops or scaffold; occasional nominalizations (“conceptual accountability”) are minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—moral repair via micro-confessions etched on a rake handle during a pendulum’s pause—is fresh and specific. Risky temporal conceit is grounded in tactile ritual; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
