<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile reading of the key, her “gift for reflected light,” her refusal to accept indifference—yet the final beat (“Today, she would hold the line…”) is asserted rather than dramatized, blunting the felt cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: key → map → tunnel → upload. Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing (“the real rebellion had just begun”) that reweights the premise, though the cost is more thematic than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The auric lagoon, star-mirrored surface, and hidden lock behind false coral are selective, sensuous, and directly constrain the path; the memorial plaque’s verdigris subtly mirrors the corrosion of memory itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering unerasable truth—tightens when the raid on the resistance cell forces Mira to act now. The upload is irreversible, foreclosing anonymity and charging the final image with risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as resistance, indifference as tyranny. The final image of the key catching dawn light offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise—“puddles became windows”—and stays within Mira’s perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision (“They moved through the darkness…”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. Minor scaffold (“Today, people would remember…”) is offset by high information density and rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopian tropes are transformed through the specific lens of vanished phone booths and star-mapped puddles; the synthesis feels inevitable and fresh, with a bold quiet ending that trusts image over spectacle.</comment>
