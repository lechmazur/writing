<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “luminous ache” and tactile tuning-fork choice crystallize her stance. Motivation (to document the ephemeral) is dramatized, not told, and the final renunciation of escape carries visible cost. Minor slip: the leap from “clock is broken” to “clock is launch mechanism” is asserted rather than earned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Ezra’s Earned Stasis—choosing to stay and repair—reweights the premise with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: tremor → clock spin → threads revealed → tuning fork → rewind. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lunar observatory, carbon cables, and spinning clock are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice (cables’ hum, glass dome pressure). The tuning fork as micro-setting object charges the final image. No wasted exposition; spatial anchors are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—station’s survival vs. escape—tightens when threads of time are revealed as literal tethers. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost (Ezra forecloses escape) is legible. Agency drives the rewind; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of suspended becoming emerges organically from Ezra’s refusal to flee; no moralizing. The luminous ache modulates from fear to recognition to acceptance, reweighted by the final backward tick. Subtext in the leaf-fall note is understated yet resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise, tactile, slightly lyric without purple drift. POV remains locked; perceptual signature (“silver blur,” “leaf-fall song”) is consistent. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the clock’s spin and breathes with the tuning-fork note. One minor filter-verb cluster mid-story (−0.1).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera that photographs duration, clock as escape pod, leaf-fall note as temporal recalibrator—all feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky speculative frame is fully committed to; no retreat to metaphor. Specificity anchors the uncanny.</comment>
