<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s inner conflict—guilt over the fleet’s misdirection—drives every beat: her tracings, transmissions, and final dual-coordinates act are rooted in a clear flaw/need conflict. Emotional shifts are embodied (grip tightening on the pen under starfire) rather than retracted into diagnostic talk. A measurable renunciation/resolution offsets the episodic nature of the AI observer.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal logic hinges on the observer-effect: each glimpse of the anomaly revealing personalised past edits tightens options toward the dual-coordinate gambit. Closure—transmit two futures—earns cost by keeping both timelines open. Orientation anchors remain sharp throughout the single-scene chamber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is not wallpaper; its selective lensing physically edits starlight and supplies the “historical editor” metaphor that constrains Mira’s every tactic. Each filtered wavelength alters parameters and resources; its drag on starlight carries the ending grief-crystal image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—save 30 000 colonists without losing cosmic discovery—tightens through spectographic revisions that foreclose single-rescue optimism. Final broadcast risks certainty itself, exchanging silence for plural histories. Misses the knife-edge escalation of a second reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Revision as cosmic mercy” emerges from Mira’s lived failure, shown in wrong seeds sprouted into void, not asserted. The ending image of gardens no human meant to plant answers the thematic cost without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Focalised observation — “constellations of data” vs “twisted starlight” — remains distinct; free-indirect tension syncs with micro-gravity drifting. No head-hop, only confident internal monologue creating propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm accelerates under micro-gravity shifts; high-density lines carry double duty (“edited the background radiation of space”). Zero filler or loops; figurative language always reorients toward stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “editor of spacetime” premise spins a fresh inversion of observer-collapsing causality; turning every causal wave into personalised history feels inevitable, not cleverness for its own sake.</comment>
