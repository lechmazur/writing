<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is embodied and specific—trembling fingers, the brass edge catching moonlight—but the “wistfully pragmatic certainty” is asserted rather than dramatized. Her micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the gauge into the dock) align with motive and foreclose the path of clinging to the past. The cost is felt: leaving the heirloom behind. Secondary characters are off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gauge’s new resting place crystallizes Marina’s shift from earth-tending to water-watching. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer (moonlit water, oar rhythm, dropped petal) deepens the stake until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the image of the abandoned tool.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is rendered through selective, purposeful detail—barnacles, mercury light, silver ripples—and constrains the final choice: the dock’s edge is the only place the gauge can be “instilled.” Micro-setting (the crack between planks) functions as setting and charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; no static postcard effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release vs. clinging—is signaled early via the dropped petal. Escalation is Accumulative: each image (oar rhythm, moonlight, memory) tightens the emotional vise until the gauge is relinquished. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the heirloom left behind. No external reversals, but the deepening pattern suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: cycles of growth and release, tools repurposed across generations. Subtext resides in the gauge’s journey from lock-opening to soil-measuring to monument. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—moonlight as mercury, “quivering hush.” Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. No dialogue, so voice distinction is N/A. Free indirect style is clean; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports rhythm. Minor elevated diction (“instill,” “repricing”) fits the reflective register. No artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—heirloom lock gauge repurposed for gardening, then surrendered to harbor—is fresh and specific. Transformation test: story would collapse if the gauge were generic. Synthesis of maritime and horticultural imagery feels inevitable. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
