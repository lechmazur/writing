<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, recognition of the seed, and nightly tending—but the shift from puzzle-solver to guardian feels slightly under-motivated; the note’s directive “Build more. Teach others” lands as external prompt rather than earned culmination of her contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the space self-protects through misdirection, and Mira accepts lifelong stewardship. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each nightly visit layers density until the final image crystallizes the cost of endless guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven is rendered with selective sensory precision—moonlit willows, storm-born silence—and the glowing root patterns physically constrain surveying equipment, charging the final image. Micro-setting (seed, brook, soil) functions as living puzzle that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wild negative space—tightens when the seed’s roots rewrite local geometry, foreclosing development. One clear escalation beat: the space becomes perceptually un-mappable, paid for by Mira’s indefinite commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of innovation-through-mystery emerges organically from Mira’s occupation and the corpse flower’s paradoxical scent. Final image of seeds needing “new guardians” reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and character-specific—“orthogonal approaches,” “storm-born silence”—with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to electric anticipation. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“impossibly fertile,” “misdirection”) fits Mira’s puzzle-designer lexicon. No loops or scaffold; final line “flowing through the dark” lands with cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Transforms familiar eco-fantasy seed into a meta-puzzle about designing unsolvable spaces. The corpse flower’s non-death scent and self-camouflaging haven feel inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking (living architecture) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
