<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—ink bleeding under tremor, spiral charts as extension of mind—yet her final choice to leave is asserted more than dramatized; the “quietly driven” trait is shown but not tested under immediate duress. Cost is implied (she steps into the hatch alone) but not embodied in a moment of forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s exit crystallizes the irreversible shift—turtles groaning, watchers cracking—while the city’s fate remains suspended. Causal chain holds: whistle silence → decoded crack → decision to follow, all under a Causal lens. The gate’s rust and hatch remain unsealed supply persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is tactile—salt-thick air, calcified stairs, barnacle borders—and the turtle shells actively guide Mira’s cartography. Final image of the first turtle moving leverages the city-as-shell premise to charge the ending with apocalyptic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the expedition) tightens into a graver one (city’s survival) via the decoded crack; pressure escalates through each new watcher fissure. Mira’s agency is clear—she chooses to leave despite the warning—yet the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of heedless inquiry versus communal safety emerges from Mira’s spiral obsession and the watchers’ warnings, never sermonized. Final image of stone eyes opening reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, rhythmic, and filtered through Mira’s cartographer’s eye—“mathematical perfection,” “salt-thick air.” Compression and patterned elision (“Do not—”) serve pressure; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“sunlight felt heavy”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Gargantuan-turtle city and stone watchers fuse into a singular, inevitable vision; the spiral language as cartographic code feels freshly minted. Risky scale is fully committed to, not hedged.</comment>
