<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; Mae’s curiously steadfast purpose manifests through the micro-choice to trust the market’s bloodline rule. Yet the final beat slides into thematic articulation—her realization that “some sounds… are worth the breaking” edges toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard of market-sound thickens the pattern until the arrest resolves with earned stasis—Mae can never return, a visible price. However, the pivotal reveal of the badge hidden inside the fob is introduced mid-action instead of seeded early; the device feels conjured at the hinge rather than prepared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rotting pier and dripping beams supply immediate sensory constriction and dictate Mae’s slow ladder descent and limited escape routes. The market’s candlelit chaos narrows perceptual field to sound and touch, shaping capture tactics. The watch fob itself functions as micro-setting that physically constrains the final exposure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—gather evidence before sunrise sale of stolen medical supplies—tightens steadily; every market murmur is potential data and potential betrayal. Sunrise becomes the living clock; options narrow from open infiltration to irrevocable exposure. The cost is unmistakable once Mae is known and exiled.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The theme of inherited honesty versus pragmatic criminality grows organically from Tommy’s legacy through Mae’s infiltration. The “sound of trust breaking” moves from abstract goal to audible gulp when the woman discovers the badge, subtext without sermon. Final articulation drifts toward on-the-nose, pulling back from perfect resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The coastal noir voice stays consistent—slightly lyrical, salty, compressed. Sensory filters (“barnacle-crusted,” “rotting wood,” “slick tide’s rhythm”) come filtered through Mae’s tense surveillance. Dialogue with the gold-capped woman drips subtext; no register drift or syntactic clutter under climax.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is densely layered yet clear; clauses tighten and breathe in step with Mae’s heartbeat. Metaphoric richness avoids purple drift by staying rooted in maritime texture. Occasional minor loops—“recording everything on the device hidden in her collar” rephrased across two adjacent beats—only nicks impact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Buys the familiar “undercover agent in outlaw bazaar” premise but recasts it through acoustic betrayal: capturing the actual sonic snap of trust fracturing. Integration of moonshine lineage, tide clock, and audio evidence feels organic rather than checklist. The watch-fob-as-badge is a fresh inflection that recharges the heirloom’s meaning.</comment>
