<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s desire to see every layer of the Reeves tragedy is embodied, embodied (rope trembles against skin), and deepened by each revealed ethical cost; the final act of replacing the rope crystallizes his renunciation of easy absolution with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each historical stratum compounds the ethical load, culminating in Marcus laying down the rope as Earned Stasis. Causality survives and closure lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta walls, amber light, rope fibers, and highway starlight are filtered through Marcus’s poet-perception, constraining movement and charging the final image. The grotto’s clay acoustics literally hum at the close, anchoring the resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Stakes escalate steadily from curiosity to moral burden; “Pattern it forward” is the single tightening command that triggers each new irreversible revelation, each narrowing choice toward acceptance of unbalanceable scales.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges not in moral dicta but in the tactile impossibility of weighing justice against mercy; the final image of Marcus laughing under starlight reweights all prior layers with cosmic, non-verbal acknowledgement.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, sinewy sentences mirror Marcus’s poet mind; patterned compression (“time had texture here, rough like rope…”) is purposeful and legible; voice remains anchored in his sensory present.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense without clogging urgency; moments of minor noun-stack (“hard-won freedom… hollows in her soul…”) are outweighed by propulsive clauses, zero paraphrase loops, no artifact drag on closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cosmic disclosure via empathic extraterrestrials with Mississippi-blues vernacular and true-crime ghost story feels singular and inevitable; no tropes remain untransformed, risk taken earns full pay-off.</comment>
