<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the copper wire’s vibration against bark—but the “brazen calm” label is asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat. The contradiction between her fear and her systematic precision is shown, yet the leap to “die at the correct frequency” feels slightly abstract, softening the cost. Still, her micro-choices (wrapping, connecting, writing) align with motive and foreclose any retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Mira reframes her death sentence into an appointment, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each copper coil adds density until the orchard’s phosphorescent pattern crystallizes the new meaning. No causality breaks; the diary’s prior constraints shape every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The temple orchard is rendered through tactile specificity—volcanic pillars fused with roots, copper against bark, phosphorescing minerals—each detail constrains Mira’s choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the copper network’s geometry is legible and causally active. The setting evolves from backdrop to active participant without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate or lose the interspecies council—tightens through each coil laid. The six-month clock is a persistent constraint that alters tactics; the final redefinition of “remodel” crystallizes the cost. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: interspecies respect as a slow, mortal collaboration. The copper network and tumor frequency embody this without sermonizing. The final image—Mira’s palm on the glowing pillar—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; the patterned elision (“not decoration—translation”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices electromagnetic pulses and mineral glow under stress. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“salt spray on a windless day”) are precise and earned. Rhythm accelerates during the final connection, then settles into the closing cadence. Zero line-level artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—an orchard as living council chamber mediated by dying caretakers—is fresh, specific, and fully committed to. The copper-wire translation device and tumor-frequency bridge are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (conceptual sci-fi in lyric mode) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
