<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“joy that tasted purple”), but the recollectionist’s choices remain observational; no decisive micro-choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The final “cheerfully gloomy” stance is consistent yet static, not earned by a prior on-page decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of gathering fragments deepens until the cave sprouts reconfigure the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—paths become seeds—charged by the final image of green shoots. Cost is felt as acceptance of perpetual incompleteness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Geode cave is rendered with synesthetic precision and subtly guides movement; the crystal floor’s rainbow feedback mirrors emotional transliteration. The sprouts at the end physically constrain interpretation, reweighting the “paths” metaphor. Micro-setting (crater glass) functions as extension of body and memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths disappear—remains conceptual; pressure tightens only through accumulating fragments and the final image shift. No concrete trade-off or forfeiture is dramatized; escalation is tonal and imagistic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and renewal emerges organically from the seed/sprout payoff. Final image reweights earlier “missing pieces” without moralizing. Subtext operates in sensory metaphors and the quiet irony of endless work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with a consistent perceptual signature (“cheerfully gloomy,” “bells wrapped in velvet”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual information. Occasional stacked metaphors risk overwriting (“genetic material of a path”) but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph crystallizes rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of emotional archaeology via sea-foam recollectionist is fresh; transformation of vanished paths into living seeds feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence and deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
