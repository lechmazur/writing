<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s contradictory impulses—professional duty vs sacred stewardship—are embodied in the tactile film-kiss and final theft; the cost (betraying her own clearance report) is legible and scaled to the word count. Interiority is specific, never clinical; “tasting silver and salt” crystallizes her decision. One minor slip: the brief diagnostic phrase “psychometrically read” could be dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer of goodbye letters thickens until the final image reweights the building from “cleared for demolition” to ark of unvoiced love. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Vera’s theft of the strip—whose cost is felt in the deliberate breach of contract. Orientation is swift; causality is carried by texture, not event chains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered as a three-dimensional diary whose corners store distinct emotions; this spatial logic constrains Vera’s discovery path and charges the final image when she pockets the film. Sensory selection is urgent—dust motes, brass teeth, velvet mouths—never touristic. One fresh inflection: the booth’s northwest corner literally “holds regret,” guiding her hand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the letters will die with the building—tightens through accumulating density rather than external opposition. The single decisive turn is Vera’s theft, which forecloses demolition’s erasure at personal cost. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the material: unexpressed love is a physical residue that outlasts architecture. The final image—letters projected onto a blank wall—offers a non-literal answer to where unused love belongs, reweighting the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext pulses in every unsent line absorbed into celluloid.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, yet anchored in Vera’s perceptual bias: “dust motes and memory,” “confession booth.” Syntax modulates with emotional surge; no head-hopping. Compression (“silver and salt”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor over-writing in “hushed thunder of her own heartbeat” is earned by context. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—psychometric projectionist harvesting unsent farewells from film emulsion—is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
