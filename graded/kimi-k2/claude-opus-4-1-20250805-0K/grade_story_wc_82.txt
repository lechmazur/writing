<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei’s grief is embodied in trembling fingers and the act of polishing; her contradictory impulse—grinding pain down while lifting love—drives every beat. The final choice to embed the gems in lanterns renounces recovery yet crystallizes love with visible cost. Interiority is specific and unflinching; no stock grief labels intrude. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mei’s thousandth crane is not paper but a lantern whose light reweights loss into guidance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each polished gem layers density until the final cadence shift. Causality is intact: every polishing session forecloses the fantasy of reunion. Cost is palpable in the basilica’s dancing shadows that still cannot bring Lin back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating tea garden, moonlit bridges, and glass basilica are rendered through Mei’s selective perception; each detail constrains her movement and charges the final image. The basilica’s transparency literalizes exposure—grief cannot be hidden. Spatial choreography is flawless; lanterns cast living shadows that reconfigure the setting’s meaning at closure. Micro-setting (the dream-gem in her palm) functions as both tool and shrine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into bearable form—is signaled early and tightened each time Mei risks reopening the wound to polish another memory. One decisive deepening occurs when the gem reveals an impossible future Lin; the cost is the fresh cut of hope. Agency remains Mei’s throughout; no coincidence rescues her. The final lantern array forecloses the path of forgetting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act itself: love persists by changing shape, not by denial. Subtext lives in the shadows cast by lanterns—absence made present. The ending reframes the thousand-crane promise without moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of ascending light descending into memory. No thematic echo is spoken aloud; the basilica’s bells toll the only commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory craft: “polishing away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love.” Syntax mirrors the dual motion—long breaths for reflection, clipped fragments under pressure. POV remains locked to Mei; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. The diction stays within a lantern-maker’s lexicon—glass, wire, gem, light—without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut; every sentence layers image and emotion. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“lanterns cast shadows that danced like living things.” Rhythm accelerates during polishing, then exhales at the bells. The final line lands clean: “ascending descent toward peace.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—grief alchemized into dream-gems embedded in lanterns—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of mourning and memorial are transformed through the specificity of lantern craft. The floating island and shadow-plague could have been generic, but Mei’s grounded perception makes them singular. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyric closure that trusts image over event.</comment>
