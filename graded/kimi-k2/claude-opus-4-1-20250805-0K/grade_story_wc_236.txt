<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her tactile reading of grief through mineral deposits and the deliberate loosening of the screw reveal a hierarchy of values. The contradiction between her lost sense and her new vocation is dramatized in action, not exposition. Mrs. Huang’s single beat of pressure is credible, but the relationship shift is more implied than staged. Closure cost is felt in Mara’s acceptance of damage as integral to function.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s resumed rhythm reweights time itself to include interruption, with the screw’s looseness as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory detail layers until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift; fog and shop are anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; the midwife tool’s return is seeded early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fogged glass and water channels function as micro-setting that constrains choice: fog softens grief, channels map emotion. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—touch and sound replace smell. The shop’s steam and brass are not backdrop but tools Mara navigates to enact repair. Final image of fog meeting fog inside the glass recharges the setting as ultrasound-like memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor irreparable loss while restoring function—is signaled by the stopped 3:47. One meaningful tightening: Mara loosens rather than tightens the screw, accepting imperfection as the price of honesty. Cost is legible in the altered tick. Pressure grows via tactile discovery, not external antagonist; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: repair is integration, not erasure. The midwife tool’s dual life as timekeeper and birth-bridge embodies continuity beyond death. Subtext in Mrs. Huang’s unfinished sentence and Mara’s “It wanted to remember” avoids moralizing. Final image of water drops as meditation reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, and consistent: “water sang different notes through copper versus brass” is perceptual signature. Compression is purposeful—fog as memory is taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; interior monologue stays within Mara’s sensory limits. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during screw extraction, breathing at close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “mineral deposits mapped emotional terrain” does double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is selective—rust as sorrow pattern is taught and sustained. Final paragraph’s cadence shift to meditative short clauses earns the quiet close.</comment>

<comment>Premise—aromatherapist who lost smell becomes water-clock repairer—feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Midwife tool repurposed as timepiece heart is fresh synthesis. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off: no twist, only deepening. Specificity of fogged glass and ultrasound-like condensation anchors universals.</comment>
