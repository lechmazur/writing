<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marion’s contradictory impulses—stoic endurance vs. creative hope—are embodied in her micro-choices (studying reels, improvising chords). The reunion with Sophia is earned by her sustained musical experiments; the cost is two years of solitary vigil. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, never slipping into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Sophia steps through the screen, time lurches to 11:48, and the compass needles lock on an unmapped bearing. The causal chain—music → harmonic corridor → emergence—is legible and irreversible. Cost is the irreclaimable two years and the unknown future encoded in that new bearing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal arbor’s coral bones and magnetic storms are not backdrop but active constraint: they channel Marion’s music into a literal corridor. The broken clock and piano strings are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; spatial choreography remains coherent as Sophia crosses from emulsion to air.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing Sophia’s loss—is signaled early and tightened through each nightly improvisation. The final beat narrows options: Marion must accept an unmapped future in exchange for reunion. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift of the compasses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: refuge is not retrieval but creation of a place where the lost can arrive. The final image—stars as perforations in film—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (condensed handprint on celluloid) and silence. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Marion’s synesthetic attention to harmonics and magnetic tremor. Syntax mirrors emotional crescendo, accelerating into the improvised prelude. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Diction stays within her lexicon of music and navigation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent (“roots of calcified coral,” “needles quiver like nervous birds”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates with tension; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The compass-storm-as-memory-diviner and film-reel-as-refuge are non-obvious syntheses that feel inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of lost love and time-slips are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking (musical corridor through coral bones) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The vision is singular and fully committed.</comment>
