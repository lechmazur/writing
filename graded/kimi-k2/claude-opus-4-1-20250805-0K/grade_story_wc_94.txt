<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—furious tranquility, the need to speak vs. the need to survive—are embodied in micro-choices (adjusting the timer, sealing the envelope) that visibly cost her. The final act of planting poems behind the timetable earns her endurance as Earned Stasis with felt risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm’s passage and the sealed envelope crystallize the new tactic—poems as mist through chains—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Each beat adds density until the final image reweights silence itself as speech.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains every choice: lightning dictates timing, altitude isolates, the darkroom’s red digits meter breath. The setting’s charged atmosphere literally powers the poem-exposures and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to speak when words are carved away—tightens via each red-ink scar and rarefied line. The cost is the perpetual risk of discovery; the deepening is learning to plant silence as seed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the negative space of censorship: scars as star-maps, silence as language. The ending’s image of “mist that passes through chains” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyric, and consistent—scientific diction fused with insurgent metaphor. Compression (“rarefied to their essence”) and rhythmic control heighten pressure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes. No loops, no scaffold; figurative language is disciplined to the storm/astronomy lexicon. Final line’s cadence mirrors the timer’s tick.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit—poems written in light inside a censored darkroom—feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the closing image; no template echo.</comment>
