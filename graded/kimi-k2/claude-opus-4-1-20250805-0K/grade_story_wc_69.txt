<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen’s interiority is specific and embodied—her finger tracing the rosette, her eyes filling—yet the final renunciation (“Take it”) is earned only by the communal epiphany, not by a prior interior contradiction that visibly costs her. The trait “expectantly resigned” is stated but not dramatized as a live tension inside her; the micro-choice to pass the zither feels externally prompted rather than internally compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each arriving student layers texture until the five modes cohere. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the rosette glowing, the cranes now “implied to be moving”—with conceptual cost: the program still ends, the zither still stored. The final image crystallizes options (students will continue without her) and reweights the premise: silence is the presence of listening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The velvet library’s sound-absorption and autumnal stillness are filtered through Chen’s sensory priorities and subtly guide choice (they gather here because it “absorbs sound”). The zither itself functions as micro-setting: its rosette constrains the final gesture—she leaves it exposed—charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vanishing arts—tightens as each student arrives and adds a thread. The meaningful deepening occurs when Chen admits she can only play three modes; the group must supply the rest, forcing collective agency. Cost is felt: the program still dissolves, but the art is transformed rather than lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vanishing arts survive not in institutions but in listening communities. The cranes’ shift from frozen to “implied moving” reweights the rosette’s symbolism without explicit moral. Subtext operates in the silent exchange of instruments and the final humming dispersal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; sensory compression (“velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain”) teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Chen. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (“Then teach us those”), carrying subtext of legacy and responsibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful—rosette cranes “no longer frozen but somehow implied to be moving”—and paid off in the final image. Line-level craft supports the Accumulative/Textural drive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>The synthesis of Chinese zither, djembe, shamisen, accordion, and more feels inevitable rather than eclectic; the transformation of five lost modes into communal harmony is a fresh angle on cultural preservation. Risk lies in the quiet, communal closure rather than a set-piece confrontation, and it lands cleanly.</comment>
