<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the copper veins and diamond curse anchor contradictory impulses. Motivation to “translate texture into sound” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices. Final renunciation—becoming bone tower—earns cost via prior causality. Minor slip: “quietly articulate” stated more than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—storyteller’s body fuses with canyon, copper veins cooling—felt cost legible in final image. Pattern taught early (starlings, bone towers) and paid off. No causality breaks; single transition (drop into canyon) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Canyon, bone towers, and flawed diamond constrain every tactic; starling patterns guide diamond angle. Sensory hierarchy (texture over sound) mirrors POV priorities. Final image recharges setting as storyteller’s new tower. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve Thuvenli’s texture—tightens as dawn clock runs. Escalation via starling gap matching diamond crack narrows options to one translation act. Cost crystallized in storyteller’s corporeal surrender. Agency drives every intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme of preservation-through-loss emerges from concrete acts: carving grooves, sealing diamond with copper. No moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer—language survives as bodily echo. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: metallic warmth, dried-lavender crumble. POV stable; perceptual signature filters all detail through texture-first synesthesia. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>High density, zero loops. Metaphors precise (diamond crack as “frozen scream”). Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo. One minor scaffold: “quietly articulate” repeated descriptor. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: language-as-texture preserved via bodily transmutation. Starling choreography and bone towers transform familiar tropes. Risk—protagonist becomes literal architecture—pays off with coherent closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
