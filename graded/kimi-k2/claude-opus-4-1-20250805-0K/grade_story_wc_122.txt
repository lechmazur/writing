<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lucia’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “reading the air’s subtle pressure,” her palms against stone—yet the thaw is asserted more than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The broken needle’s evolving meaning and her final pocketing of it show earned change, but the numbness-to-feeling arc is compressed into lyrical summary rather than a visible beat of decision or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the needle’s polished tip and Lucia’s re-framed deafness crystallize a new stance with felt cost (“her deafness wasn’t an ending but a transformation”). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each backward revolution deepens the pattern until the final silence reweights meaning. Minor compression of the decisive thaw keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cavern’s acoustic memory and stone resonance constrain Lucia’s experiment and charge the final image; the drum makers’ ghosts and the needle’s scratch against vinyl are tactile, selective, and filtered through her deafened perception. Spatial choreography is coherent; the single setting focuses pressure. The environment’s vibration literally becomes the “setting” that enables her bone-deep listening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened through each reversed revolution; the backward music’s intensifying vibration forces a stance crystallization. Agency is exercised in the setup and the final pocketing of the needle, with the cost of permanent deafness reweighted as gift. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as active music, reversal as forward motion. The mirrored hush and broken needle’s journey embody the concept without overt statement. Final image of “earth’s own backward recorded song” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lucia’s perceptual signature—pressure on skin, vibration in bone—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her hushed, reverent attention: long lyrical sentences for immersion, then clipped fragments (“Hours passed, or perhaps minutes”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which remains distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is purposeful (“spreading numbness that threatened to erase all feeling”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. Occasional elevated diction (“audibly muted,” “perceptual signature”) is justified by the meditative lens. Final paragraph’s cadence recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fusing deafness with backward phonography to access bone-conducted music is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The drum-maker cavern’s acoustic history and the damaged needle as conduit feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—reversed sound as emotional cure—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of Lucia’s embodied listening grounds the concept.</comment>
