<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—fear of abandonment vs. acceptance of transition—is embodied in her tactile handling of the cicada and her warm but firm refusal to let Chen retreat. The micro-choice of placing the cicada back in his hand crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs Chen his isolation. Chen’s visible struggle with the burden of foresight gives him credible flaws and a believable arc from flight to tentative return. Relationship shift is legible in the final nod, earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s quiet insistence that “every ending is just the pause before another beginning” reconfigures Chen’s options and carries the felt cost of his resumed responsibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of tidal imagery and cicada motif tighten toward the final bioluminescent wave. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: the returning tide that will soon erase the pools underscores the urgency of chronicling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto’s wet stone, barnacles, and mirrored pools are filtered through Mira’s chronicler gaze, constraining movement and shaping dialogue acoustics. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, its cool weight a tactile reminder of temporal debt. Sensory hierarchy (starlight, drip, crab clicks) narrows under emotional pressure. Final image of plankton sparks charges the closure with luminous cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Chen’s retreat from the burden of foresight vs. Mira’s insistence on witnessing transition—is signaled early and tightened by the single wave that rearranges the grotto. Escalation is textural: each pool’s micro-transition accumulates until Chen’s stance crystallizes. Cost is visible in his reluctant nod and the implied return to chronicling. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the tide merely underscores stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges sideways: the texture of time is not measured but witnessed, destruction and creation inseparable. Subtext lives in gesture—Chen closing his fingers around the cicada, Mira’s smile under starlight. Final image of plankton like fallen stars reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira’s chronicler diction (“delicate negotiations,” “calcium cities”) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Chen’s whispered “The weight of that knowledge…” carries more than confession. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>High information density: each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Metaphors are precise (“spider crab…from three different angles”) and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases for tide’s advance. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: tidal-pool ecology as metaphor for temporal transition, chronicling as ethical act. Cicada lore is transformed from cliché to lived burden. Specificity of barnacle cities and bioluminescent plankton anchors universals. Risky quiet ending lands with undeniable pressure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
