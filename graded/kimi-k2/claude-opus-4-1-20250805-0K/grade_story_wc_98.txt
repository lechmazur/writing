<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulse to preserve yet question memory crystallizes in the swallowing of the seed. The final choice to classify “Quantum Folklore” is earned by the dream-walk that reweights her stance. Cost is felt: she knowingly risks Council censure. Minor slip: “empirically whimsical” leans label-speak mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger entry redefines reality itself, with the opalescent seed as visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each memory shard layers density until the pattern break of deliberate paradox. Orientation is swift; causality is dream-logic but coherent. No teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-orchid ridge and the seed-as-micro-setting constrain Mira’s stance and charge the final image (“petal a different version”). Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Weather tightens the clock. One minor spatial drift: “fell not down but through” could be clearer, but dream logic is taught early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the Ninth Island’s stories—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates via the monsoon countdown. The tightening beat is Mira’s reclassification; it forecloses the Council’s standard test and carries social cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: cultures survive through proliferating, contradictory memory. The final image of rain-sustained island offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in Mira’s ledger entry and the seed’s opalescent glow. No thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Mira’s scientific-poetic diction (“laughter recorded on seismographs”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for dream corridors, clipped for the ledger moment. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“petals translucent as forgotten names” returns as “petal a different version”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“empirically whimsical warmth”—but it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum folklore as survival strategy. The paradox-memory conceit is fully committed to and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure is taught early and lands cleanly. No derivative echoes.</comment>
