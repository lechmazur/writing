<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The summoner’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile communion with the glade, the “patient as a shepherd” patience, the felt cost of dispersing futures. Motive is consistent and intensifies: from quiet custodian to active guardian willing to erase her own footprints. The Earned Stasis of leaving “only footprints that the brook would soon smooth away” carries visible cost. Minor slip: mentor flashback is summary rather than embodied memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy dissolves, futures scatter, summoner accepts erasure of her deed. Causal chain—wing unfolds, silence is mapped, prophecy is redirected—holds cleanly. Cost is legible in the drained wing and the summoner’s solitary dawn. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven is not backdrop but instrument: stones, reeds, brook-mist all recruited to muffle destiny. Micro-setting (the flat stone, the brook’s murmur) constrains every tactical choice. Final image of morning light “brighter but somehow less real” recharges the setting’s transformation. One minor redundancy: “terrestrially cosmic twin” is vivid but slightly self-conscious.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent prophecy from cohering—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened each time a luminous fragment is caught. Escalation is accumulative: each silenced shard raises the cost of failure. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. The price is the summoner’s anonymity and the futures she erases.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: knowledge as burden, silence as mercy. Subtext lives in gestures—fingers tracing constellations, wing crumbling into “ordinary paper.” Final image reweights the premise: ignorance as peace. No moralizing; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a summoner-specific perceptual signature: “moth-thoughts and owl-dreams,” “invisible fruit” of silence. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, winding sentences during mapping, clipped release at dawn. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple drift: “crystallized moonlight folded into impossible angles” is exact. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“shadows bent to her will”—is minor and does not blur causality.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: prophecy-management as ecological stewardship, futures dissolved into whale songs. The crane’s wing, mentor’s dictum, and brook’s flow feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
