<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mei’s pacifism is embodied in micro-choices—tracing tears, uncapping the vial, stitching with intention—yet the interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she knew what waited”). The final integration of shadow-self is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dimensional barrier ceases to exist, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photograph, tear, and stitch layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The recycled monastery-ship is tactile—warships becoming gardens, prison walls to shelters—and constrains choice by supplying the tear-streaked photographs that guide Mei’s method. Micro-setting (the meditation chamber’s gravity well) directly affects her balance between sorrow and joy, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrate humanity’s shadow or perish—tightens through each traced tear and final stitch; the cost is the dissolution of the photograph and Mei’s weightless release. Escalation is accumulative: density of grief and memory increases until the cadence shift reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of integration emerges from concrete action—stitching light and dark—rather than statement. The final image of Mei “holding space for all that was” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the shimmering tears and groaning hull deepens the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mei’s contemplative stance. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during stitching, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—e.g., “oil on water” for the darker shimmer—never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of a pacifist last human stitching shadow into wholeness feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure pays off; the recycled ship and tear-stitch method are specific and irreplaceable. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
