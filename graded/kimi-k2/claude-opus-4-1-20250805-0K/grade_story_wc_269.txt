<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is concrete—her fingertip tapping, the diary cue, the decision to descend. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity) coexist in scene. The final renunciation (leaving the station) carries visible cost: she abandons safety to dive into the transformed town. One slip: the phrase “periodically eternal” is label-speak without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station touches water, Lena accepts the coral city, cost is the surrender of scientific distance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tapping and image density reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The station’s glass, metal, plastic tones, the white reef below, and the diary page anchor who-where-when. Micro-setting (floor panels reflecting coral foundations) constrains the final choice to descend. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One minor drift: “seventeen meters above” is precise yet unverified.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover what happened to Mooreton—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when Lena sees architectural shadows in coral; options narrow to diving. Cost is legible: abandoning scientific detachment. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation vs. loss emerges from coral imagery and diary fragments, never stated. Final image (her face superimposed on the submerged town) offers non-literal answer: persistence through metamorphosis. Subtext in tapping rhythms and atlas page reprise is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in scientific lexicon (“temperature, salinity, pH”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives under discovery, longer cadences in reflection. Perceptual signature is distinct: Lena hears surfaces sing. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“white as funeral bones”) serve moment without overwriting. One mixed metaphor—“calcium and silence”—is minor. Strong cadence control in final descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drowned town as living coral memory. Tapping rhythms as ancestral code feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
