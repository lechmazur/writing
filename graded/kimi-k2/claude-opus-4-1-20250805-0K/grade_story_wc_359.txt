<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrian’s synesthetic gift and her quiet defiance of the Council are vivid, but interior contradiction is underplayed; the moment she “understood—this wasn’t meant for bells at all” arrives as summary rather than embodied struggle, muting the cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the aurora’s takeover reconfigures the world and the Basilica’s fate, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt social cost. Causal chain is lyric but coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the amber sheet dissolves, sealing the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern as instrument is richly specific—each bubble a “frozen note”—and directly constrains the climax: the walls must resonate for the aurora to descend. Spatial choreography is tight; the setting is both stage and co-performer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and tightened when demolition looms. The single escalation beat (striking the wall) unleashes irreversible change; cost is diffuse but legible in the Council’s shattered meters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder’s necessity emerges through sensory spectacle rather than assertion. The final aurora-drenched city reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “oscillating repose,” inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, and consistent; “turquoise sound that she could taste as cinnamon” is character-specific perception. Rhythm modulates with tension, and no POV leakage occurs. Experimental compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“liquid light,” “cathedral of sensation”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synesthesia, aurora-music, and anti-utilitarian rebellion feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of silence into instrument is a non-obvious synthesis that deepens on reflection.</comment>
