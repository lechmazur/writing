<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira’s drive to weave communal memory into the arbor is embodied in tactile reed-work and mirrored micro-choices; the climactic gesture—offering the reed-circle to the exiled artist—crystallizes her arc with visible cost (shared exile risked). Interiority stays concrete, though “boldly sympathetic” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s spiral path re-weights the arbor from monument to living mirror, cost legible in the dawn climb and tear-stained return. Causal chain (tag → path → discovery) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; only the 3-month ellipsis is a mild ellipsis-motivated jump.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater walls are not backdrop but tools: the arbor’s glass bones snag reeds, the crater path funnels the final descent. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the “luminescent ache” is evoked through reflected lantern light rather than declared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting the lost artist back into communal memory—tightens via each mapped tag; the spiral discovery forces a collective stance crystallization. Agency remains communal, but Kira’s reed-gift is the decisive act that forecloses exile; cost is felt in the tearful ascent and dawn labor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the arbor’s transformation: monument → mirror → living web. Subtext lives in the unspoken fear that any member could vanish like the first artist; the final wordless melody carries the conceptual re-weighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Kira’s reed-scented, calloused tactility; free-indirect drift into communal “we” at closure is taught by the choral descent and feels intentional. Syntax modulates with emotional crests, avoiding template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative layering (“translucent fruit catching fire”) is purposeful and pattern-taught. One minor paraphrase loop (“each dawn… each evening”) is offset by rhythmic variation; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of extinct-language village, obsidian arbor, and reed-sculpture feels non-obvious yet inevitable; the spiral-tag conceit transforms a familiar “lost artist” trope into communal cartography. Specificity of marsh reeds and volcanic glass anchors the vision.</comment>
