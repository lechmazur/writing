<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is rich and embodied—her “grip reality loosely” trait shows in micro-choices like unfolding the swan with “infinite care.” Yet her silence and stasis, while thematically apt, limit visible contradiction and escalating stakes; the final renunciation is more thematic than dramatized, so the cost feels conceptual rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the library’s slow decay and the swan’s re-foldings tighten the pattern until the final image crystallizes the keeper as “pure witness.” Closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subterranean library, obsidian alcove, and phosphorescent moss are vivid and selective; the river’s murmur threads through beats, charging the final image. The setting constrains choice—silence is enforced by the ecology itself—meeting the 9+ gate, though the space could exert even more tactile pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—signaled early. Pressure deepens via seasonal drift and explorers’ intrusions, forcing the keeper to recommit to silence. The tightening is more accretive than causal; the cost is conceptual (loss of speech, loss of recorded history) and legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-decay emerges organically from composting books and refolded swan. No explicit moralizing; the ending’s “eternal present moment” reweights prior motifs with quiet resonance. Subtext in gesture (handing explorers paper) is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature—“phosphorescent moss painted shadows green.” Patterned elision (time, speech) is taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Occasional poetic stacking (“books became mulch became moss became memory”) risks overwriting but fits the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolds; strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a living library that composts knowledge into silence. The origami-swan-as-map device is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric stasis as plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
