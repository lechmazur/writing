<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s shift from “weed” to “dance with the dead” hinges on a single micro-choice—the dab of perfume—yet her inner contradiction (destroy versus collaborate) stays sharp on the page; the cost (orchard gone) is felt through Elisabetta’s dissolving kiss and the perfumed emptiness in her wrists.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure occurs when Vera’s “Think of it like a dance” reconfigures the premise; the causal chain—the chainsaws force time pressure, perfume becomes collaborator, apology turns into score—culminates in a visible conceptual cost: the requiem finished just as the grove is gone forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Archive’s dust, green-glowing bottle, and scent of bergamot & roses all constrain choice: the bottle is later handled, the smell determines collaboration, the falling tree dust underlines cost; setting actively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—finish the requiem before trees are lost—tightens every beat; each leaf-fall above tightens time, culminating in tangible cost: orchard gone, perfume emptied, music completed; escalation is agency-driven via Vera’s decision to scribe.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme of “imperfect miracles” and reconciliation through brokenness never lectures; it crystallizes in the final line about ghosts finishing their work, rendering Vera’s earlier newspaper column a hollow platitude reweighted by embodied experience.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct tactile vocabulary ("scent carried her into the current", perfumed air) stays within POV range; sentences flow with natural rhythm that modulates under chainsaw tension; dialogue voices of Marcus and Elisabetta remain distinct in harmony and cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Sensory density is high but purposeful; no paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors; every sentence advances: “archives smelled… sweeter—bergamot and old roses,” “chainsaws warming up,” “perfume bottle pulsed”, all with clear cause order.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Converts stock exorcist trope into collaborator; historic orchard demolition as countdown clock; perfume bottle as ghost medium—all original syntheses grown from character stakes; final “scent of roses and bergamot” feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
