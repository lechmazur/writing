<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s curiosity and engineering mindset are credibly embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing pipes, opening valves), but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “hope” language that blurs contradiction. The final renunciation—she will return tomorrow—earns its cost through the embodied exhaustion of the resurrected fountain, yet the emotional layering feels slightly tidy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s hydraulic brain re-animates, reweighting Maya’s purpose from puzzle-solver to steward of “permanent enchantment.” Causal chain holds—sextant constants → valve turns → fountain arcs—though the leap from plumbing to “machine for hope” edges toward conceptual repricing rather than strict causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: confetti on terrazzo, rust flaking from copper, water arcs mapping shuttle trajectories. The terminal itself becomes a character, constraining choices via hidden pipe logic and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the carnival’s afterglow feels slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the hydraulic maze—tightens once when the fountain erupts, foreclosing the option to dismiss the system as mere plumbing. Cost is visible in Maya’s all-night labor and the terminal’s groaning protest, but escalation is more accumulative/textural than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: infrastructure as encoded aspiration. The final image of water tracing “equations for hope” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the sextant’s etched constants quietly links celestial navigation to human intention, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-consistent; perceptual signature favors precise engineering diction (“pressure differential,” “parabolas”) filtered through wonder. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure—short clauses during valve turns, longer cadences at dawn. No dialogue, so voice remains singular and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“water arced in precise parabolas”) serves function, not ornament. Minor scaffold in repeated “each pipe/valve/junction” phrasing, but no loops obscure causality. Final paragraph leans slightly purple yet lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—abandoned spaceport as celestial astrolabe via plumbing—is fresh and non-obvious. Transformation test passes: story collapses without terminal-as-instrument. Risk in blending engineering rigor with lyric wonder pays off; no close echoes detected.</comment>
