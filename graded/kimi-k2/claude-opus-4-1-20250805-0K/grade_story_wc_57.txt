<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—her tactile decoding of knots, the fulgurite glass as teaching tool—but the “philosophical seed collector” label is more stated than dramatized; the final choice to pass knowledge to the granddaughter is clear and motivated, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: fog thickens, knots yield data, stakes narrow to “teach or lose.” Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—Mara coiling the rope, deciding to teach—with the cost of personal solitude legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and rope form a micro-setting that constrains visibility and movement; the weathered planks and dissolving flakes mirror the fragility of the knowledge. The fulgurite glass and rope function as tactile “settings” that guide choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vanishing knowledge—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each knot decoded narrows the remaining time before the fog lifts. The cost is the realization that she must now become the teacher, foreclosing her solitary role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge encoded in nature and craft emerges through action, not statement; the final image of Mara coiling the rope reweights the earlier fulgurite metaphor, suggesting continuity rather than loss. Subtext is carried by gesture and object rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity; free-indirect style stays close to Mara’s patient, methodical perception. Rhythm modulates with the fog’s ebb and flow, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances decoding or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the quiet, crystallized decision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar motifs—weather reading, encoded knowledge—are refreshed by the knot-language and fulgurite synthesis. The “secret weavers” concept feels organic, not gimmicky, and the quiet ending avoids melodrama while still reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
