<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cornelius’s synesthetic ghosthood and longing for Isabella are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the final reunion is earned through his echo-conducting agency. Interiority is specific—tastes of honey-copper, cardamom, strawberries—never generic. The only minor slip is Isabella’s near-instant solidity, which feels slightly under-costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lovers’ eternal encore reweights time itself, with the carved bench and transformed coin as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—echoes braid past/future until possibility crystallizes. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s fractured timeline is not backdrop but active constraint: apple trees bearing out-of-season fruit mirror Cornelius’s temporal dislocation and enable the final braid. Micro-setting (amphitheater bench, coin) charges the closure image. Sensory specificity is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reunion with Isabella—tightens once: the coin’s warmth signals the decisive turn, and every echo narrows possibility toward that single outcome. Cost is visible in the transformed coin and newly carved names. Agency remains with Cornelius throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love transcending linear time emerges organically from the orchard’s temporal fractures and the ghosts’ echo-braid. Final image of intertwined dancers on the coin offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext of “every ending a beginning” is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, synesthetic metaphors consistent and character-bound. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—tastes, colors, sounds—anchors every beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and pays off. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal fractures,” “conceptual repricing”) fits ghostly register without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic ghost conducting time-music via Shakespearean echoes to resurrect lost love. Risky temporal braid feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; specificity of orchard seeds from “futures that might have been” is unforgettable.</comment>
