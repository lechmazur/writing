<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira’s grief-driven hunt is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (grief vs hope) clash in the scanner beat. The geode as memory-anchor and the choice to transmit data show earned cost. Minor slip: Dr. Chen’s pivot from skeptic to ally feels abrupt, slightly undercutting relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: geode scan → data spike → security breach → transmission. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Amira’s smile while security storms in crystallizes the irreversible act with felt cost. Cooling-cycle clock tightens options cleanly; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating observatory’s sterile light and three-kilometer altitude ground the stakes; the scanner interface and cooling ducts constrain tactics. Geode’s crystalline interior doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim stolen futures—signaled early and tightened by the ticking cooling cycle. One meaningful escalation: scanner reveals trapped potential, forcing the irreversible upload. Cost is visible in Amira’s exposure to security. Coincidence (early re-engagement) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaimed potential emerges from the geode’s literal recording of unlived futures; no overt moralizing. Final image of “tomorrow’s stolen dreams” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in Chen’s whispered “They’ll destroy this research” sharpens stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Amira’s perceptual signature—sterile light, heavy geode, quantum jargon filtered through grief. Compression (“Physics demanded it”) feels voice-motivated. Dr. Chen’s diction distinctively shifts from clinical to awed; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance plot or atmosphere without loops. “Weight of unlived moments pressing against reality’s thin membrane” risks poetic inflation but lands because it charges the closure. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Quantum grief-recycling premise feels fresh; trope of “crystal records tragedy” is transformed by tying it to real-world drone strike aftermath. Specificity of Kandahar wedding and architectural plans grounds universality. Risky elevation conceit pays off by making boundary thinner—inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
