<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the river stone and shadow footage anchor her contradictory impulses—scientific skepticism vs. inherited faith. Her micro-choice to enter the dream-archive reconfigures her vocation with visible cost: “luminous regret” and the warm stone. The final renunciation—tending shadows across generations—earns its poignancy through prior causality. Minor slip: “luminous regret” edges toward label-speak, blunting full 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of archival footage, stone, and shadow layers density until the final vision reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira’s new vocation crystallizes with felt cost (“some dreams take generations to bloom”). Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the grandmother’s dream is revealed more than dramatized, slightly diluting earned change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blooming library’s bio-glass petals and perpetual dusk are selective, sensuous, and thematically charged; they refract hope into prismatic light that constrains Mira’s final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; the stone’s small shadow on the desk mirrors the larger shadow-migration. Micro-setting (stone, desk, interface) functions as extension of character choice. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope across time—is signaled early and tightens once when Mira chooses to enter the dream. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong custodianship of shadows. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope’s transgenerational persistence through attentive love. Subtext resides in the shadow’s “softly deliberate” migration and the stone’s patient warmth. Final image—stone’s small shadow as quiet witness—offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature sharp (“sharp-eyed dusk noticer,” “prismatic light”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“walls that hummed with stored memories”) and paid off in closure. Minor elevated diction (“luminous regret”) slightly jars but stays within tolerable range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional near-purple (“colors that had no names, only feelings”) is earned by context. Clean mechanics; no clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—shadow as migratory vessel for unfulfilled dreams—is fresh and fully committed. Synthesizes archival footage, dream-sharing tech, and stone into inevitable-feeling whole. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
