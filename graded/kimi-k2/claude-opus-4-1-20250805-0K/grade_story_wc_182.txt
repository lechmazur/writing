<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm against stone, the diary’s warmth—but the “carefully resourceful” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the silk-thread trick. The final choice to offer the diary’s blank pages feels earned by prior linguistic expertise, yet her contradictory impulses (hoard vs. plant) are summarized rather than shown in scene. The frozen seekers provide external stakes, but relationships remain symbolic rather than crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s offer transforms the mountain’s contract and releases the seekers, with the cost of perpetual stewardship legible in the silver text filling the diary. Causality holds under a Causal lens—each password, map, and negotiation step links because/therefore. Orientation is swift; the only minor drag is the off-stage time-traveler warning, which functions as ellipsis rather than break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is rendered with tactile specificity—granite shelves, humming frequencies, amber scent—yet remains conceptually coherent. The shifting corridors and singing books constrain navigation and force Mira’s silk-thread tactic. The final garden metaphor recharges the botanical motif, turning setting into active agent rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access vs. entrapment—is signaled early and tightens through each level: the circular room’s logic test, the amber museum, the mountain’s demand. Agency is high; Mira’s linguistic choices narrow options and escalate cost. The release of the seekers provides visible consequence, though the price she personally pays (eternal chronicler) is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unlearned lessons must be replanted, not archived. The botanical diary’s blank pages become a resonant image of future possibility rather than past failure. Subtext operates in the mountain’s silence and the seekers’ frozen reach. No moralizing—wisdom is enacted, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that accelerates during descent and breathes at the amber chamber. Perceptual signature is strong—Mira’s linguistic ear filters every detail through etymological attention. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. The mountain’s “voice” is felt, not heard, maintaining coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with only minor loop risk (“humming frequencies... unheard symphony” could tighten). Metaphors are coherent—amber smelling of forgotten gardens, starlight-bound book. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The living mountain-library of failed rescues is a fresh synthesis of Borgesian and eco-fantasy tropes, transformed through botanical linguistics. The twist—offering blank pages instead of taking knowledge—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of extinct-flower ink and silver silk anchors the concept. Risk-taking (negotiating with a mountain) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
