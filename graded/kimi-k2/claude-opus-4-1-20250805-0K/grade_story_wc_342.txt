<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s prosopagnosia is woven into every tactile choice; her final realization that “faces are merely one form of identity” is earned through embodied action with mirrors and coin. Interior contradiction surfaces when she both mourns and transcends her limitation, culminating in a visible renunciation (she walks away carrying the sky). The only drag is a brief diagnostic label “prosopagnosia had stolen that gift at birth,” but it is immediately dramatized by touch-based perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s light-portrait crystallizes the library’s identity and forecloses her staying; cost is legible in the sentence “the library would fall, but its face…would endure.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each tactile discovery layers density until the final moonlit pattern reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The hollow oak is not backdrop but active constraint: its scars, ladder marks, and moon-gaps dictate how Lyra positions mirrors and reads the coin. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—touch over sight—guiding every beat. Final image of “carrying the sky inside her own walls” recharges the setting as internalized space, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the library’s essence—tightens as demolition clock counts down from three hours to 4:47 AM. One decisive deepening: Lyra shifts from recording faces to recording the library’s “face,” narrowing her task and raising its conceptual cost. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: knowledge as palimpsest of human continuity, identity beyond the visual. Subtext lives in the coin’s spiral of faces and Lyra’s wordless handing-off of memory. Final image offers non-literal resonance—“the space between touching and knowing”—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, and consistent: “fractally precise detail,” “accumulated breath of centuries.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments as dawn nears. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains uniquely Lyra’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “moonbeams…creating shadows that danced across the curved walls” performs setting, action, and theme in one stroke. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“verdigris,” “palimpsest”) fits the scholarly POV and never muddies clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind artist tasked to “portrait” a living library via touch and light—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk in the lyric accumulative structure pays off: the coin’s spiral and the mirror constellation are not gimmicks but organic engines of meaning. Transformation test fails if names or places change, confirming originality.</comment>
