<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s claustrophobia and “prudently adventurous” trait are embodied in micro-choices—memorizing escape routes, pocketing the compass, letting music guide steps. Interior contradiction peaks when fear should paralyze yet curiosity propels him into the nexus. The final ascent shows earned change: boundaries are now “waiting to be redrawn,” a credible renunciation of his former limits with visible cost—he carries two compasses and altered perception. One slip: the phrase “something altogether more paradoxical had returned” edges into label-speak, blunting embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus pockets the second compass and sees stars as movable, reweighting the premise of fixed space. Causal linkage holds—each beat (blueprint glow, organ coordinates, twin compass) flows because/therefore to this reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early; the geometric wound and starlight locate us. Cost is legible in the final image: “two compass points waited to draft new blueprints,” a persistent constraint and promise of future risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful: starlight on compass metal, “geometric wound,” spherical room where stone turns translucent. Environment constrains choice—walls press, angles hurt, corridors shift—charging the final image. Micro-setting (the compass in pocket) functions as tactile anchor. One minor drift: “stars wheeled in their eternal dance” leans generic, but the later reprise reweights it effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the lost key to spatial rebellion—is signaled early and tightened when the organ’s music becomes the only path. Escalation is causal: blueprint responds, passages rearrange, compass twins appear. Cost is visible—Marcus’s claustrophobia should paralyze but he pays with irrevocable perceptual shift. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of mutable space versus divine stasis emerges through concrete events—bent corridors, glowing blueprint, twin compasses—never stated. Final image reweights prior material: stars are no longer fixed but “could be moved.” Subtext in the organ’s lonely defiance resonates without moralizing. Complexity lingers: freedom is exhilarating and isolating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and consistent: “trembling fingers,” “compass point caught starlight,” “music reverberated through his bones.” Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses under pressure, longer lyric stretches in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Marcus. One elevated phrase—“spatial mutiny against the church’s monopoly on sacred geometry”—skews academic but is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (“The drafting compass point in his hand caught starlight as he marked another measurement”). Rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and precise. Minor register drift noted above does not recur in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—cartographers encoding rebellion in folded space—feels fresh and fully committed. Tropes of underground quest and mystical music are transformed through precise geometry and claustrophobic POV. Final reconfiguration (“even stars could be moved”) is inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in non-Euclidean architecture heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
