<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is embodied in the dewdrops on his sax and the weight of the vested hush; his contradictory impulse—play to not play—drives every beat. The final renunciation of sound is earned by the grandfather’s journals and the on-page cost of permanent silence. Minor slip: “remembered melodies they would never play” edges toward summary rather than embodied loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each near-note thickens the silence until the prophecy is muffled. Closure is a Charged Poise—the grotto’s quiet now cradles the sleeping words, cost legible in “permanent silence.” Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radiant grotto’s bioluminescent moss and dew-wet brass are filtered through Marcus’s jazz-trained senses; the prism atrium literally bends silence into mass, constraining the tactic of non-playing. Final image of falling dew-prisms reweights the entire tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the encoded prophecy—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each withheld note. The collective non-performance narrows options to one: eternal quiet. Cost is visceral in “ghost-memories” and the “price of permanent silence.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence as generative resistance emerges through action, not statement; the final rainbow in a dewdrop reframes the prophecy as a lullaby rather than doom. No moralizing—just the felt cost of futures unplayed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“vested hush,” “quietly vivid tableau”—with rhythmic control that mirrors jazz phrasing. Compression and elision (“hours passed, or perhaps minutes”) are taught early and paid off in the timeless closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Dewdrops carrying away syllables” is exact and fresh. Minor cadence repetition in “each musician remembered…” but it serves the liturgical mood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The inversion of jazz—music as anti-music, prophecy silenced by deliberate non-performance—is a fresh synthesis. Risky choice pays off: the silence becomes a character. No derivative echoes; the dew-prism rainbow feels inevitable yet new.</comment>
