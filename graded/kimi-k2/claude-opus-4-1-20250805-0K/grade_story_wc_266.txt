<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is embodied and specific—voice hoarse, fingers opening, heart punched with star-shaped light. The contradiction between fear of loss and need for release is dramatized in the moment she confesses to the sky. The final choice to walk leash-less is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the ferry guides’ absence and the ticket’s phosphorescence. Minor slip: the guides themselves remain archetypal rather than individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina’s stance crystallizes when she steps onto the shore that is also the starting place, now reweighted by the star-punched ticket. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery (mist, limestone, leash, star) accrues density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the blank ticket turned luminous and the guides’ fading. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, limestone teeth, and twilight water are vivid, selective, and filtered through Marina’s urgency. The star-punched ticket functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sight under pressure. One minor drift: “channels between the limestone teeth” could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding what she truly lost by holding on—is signaled early and tightens once when she confesses her fear. The meaningful turn is her decision to cross back alone, foreclosing the option of continued control. Cost is felt in the guides’ withdrawal and the leash’s absence. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of release versus control emerges organically from Marina’s embodied choices; no moralizing. The final image—star-shaped light leaking through her ticket—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the ferry guides’ silence and the dog’s wagging tail. One soft echo: “unused courage waits” edges toward label-speak but is saved by immediate dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“gently persistent rhythm as waves against shingle”). Perceptual signature is Marina’s—selective attention to leash, ticket, and light. No POV drift; dialogue sparse but subtextual. One near-slip: “courage sleeps in its unused corners” flirts with abstraction but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Minor loop: “like mist and limestone, like trust and release” is a brief template cadence but serves the lullaby pattern. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ferry-as-liminal-therapy trope is refreshed through tactile specificity (star-punched ticket, kelp-beard guide) and Marina’s singular voice. The synthesis of dog-as-unleashed-joy feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity. One derivative echo: “veiled ridgeway” is familiar, but context reweights it.</comment>
