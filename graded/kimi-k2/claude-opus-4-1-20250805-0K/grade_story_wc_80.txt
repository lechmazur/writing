<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Edmund’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in micro-choices—holding the satchel high, whispering to the cornerstone—yet the interior contradiction between official duty and private grief remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the act of sealing the bottle reconfigures the pavilion’s fate and forecloses Edmund’s ability to save the structure, with the cost legible in the final image of ripples and scheduled demolition. Accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion, inkwell, and rising tide constrain every move; the chandelier inches above water and the gap in the cornerstone directly enable the hiding act, charging the final image with tangible cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—tightens as the tide rises and the demolition clock looms; the single decisive act of entombing the bottle narrows options and exacts the price of permanent loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “interlaced absence” emerges through concrete particulars—empty seats, silent music—culminating in the non-literal answer that what is missing now defines what remains; no moralizing, only resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: surveyor’s precision in noticing subsidence angles and barnacle crust, rhythmic control in cadence shifts under watery pressure, no head-hopping; occasional elevated diction (“brackish,” “verdigris”) fits the educated focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but two adjacent sentences near the end (“He turned back… carrying the weight…”) restate departure without new pressure, a minor loop that keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of climate-loss elegy and intimate archive; the surveyor-as-archaeologist angle transforms familiar eco-grief into specific, lived ritual. Only the inkwell motif feels slightly over-curated, preventing 9+.</comment>
