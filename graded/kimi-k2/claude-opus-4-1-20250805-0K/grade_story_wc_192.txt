<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“charcoal pillars rose like burnt fingers”), but the keeper’s renunciation of all human ties is asserted more than dramatized; the final beat with the doorknocker ring earns the change, yet earlier relationships remain off-stage, softening cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, Accumulative/Textural lens taught early; closure is a Charged Poise—“some bridges must burn to light the way forward”—with felt conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s charcoal pillars, absent roof, and starlight are selective, tactile, and mirrored in the keeper’s scars; the doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting that constrains her final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeper’s vocation to teach shadows to “exhale”—tightens through each encroaching shadow; agency is renunciation/attendance. Cost is visible: each scar glows, each bridge burned is irreversible. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of necessary absence emerges from concrete acts (severed ties, glowing scars) rather than statement; final image of “fading thresholds” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in the ring’s warmth and the shadows’ breathing carries resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature is keeper-centric (“wounded animals,” “surgical precision”). No dialogue; free-indirect compression is purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under starlight, longer ruminative arcs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and coherent. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“cauterized,” “conceptual repricing”) fits keeper’s arcane vocation. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of a monastery turned shadow-hospice is fresh; trope of the hermit-healer is inverted by the necessity of burning bridges. Specificity of the doorknocker ring and scar-to-shadow pedagogy creates non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode pays off.</comment>
