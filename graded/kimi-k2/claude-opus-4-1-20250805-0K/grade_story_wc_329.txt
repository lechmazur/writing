<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty, nostalgia vs. rebellion) play out in embodied micro-choices like pressing the seed into her palm. The final renunciation—playing herself empty—earns its cost through prior mapping of rhythms and the visible shattering of her safety. Minor slip: “remembered gentle” is a fragment that blurs the guardian’s recovered agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s chaotic bloom and Lira’s emptied playing reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each intensifying image (statues faltering, trees walking) layers density until the final cadence shift. No causality breaks; the locust shell’s early cue pays off in the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sky-bridge’s iron lattice and the welded trees constrain every tactical choice; the locust shell micro-setting charges the final image when Lira becomes the abandoned husk. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—wind through metal, warm seed—anchoring POV bias. One minor drift: “productive angles” leans expository.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty at personal cost—tightens through escalating pattern breaks: first statue falters, then orchard uproots. Agency remains Lira’s; each musical phrase narrows her escape options until she accepts the price of becoming shell. Cost is legible in the final “played herself empty.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between efficiency and metamorphosis; the locust shell’s return in the closing image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the guardian’s hand offering seed, Lira’s closed eyes—avoiding abstract labels. Complexity lingers: beauty’s cost is felt, not preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lira’s trained ear (“industrial frequencies,” “metronomic time”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences swell, then fragment as alarms ring. No POV leakage; diction stays within plausible musician lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“tarnished wonder caught fire”). One mixed metaphor—“roots that could uproot themselves”—is minor and doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanized orchard, living statues, violin as insurgent tool. The locust shell’s transformation trope is inverted—liberation through abandonment, not arrival. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image; no derivative echoes.</comment>
