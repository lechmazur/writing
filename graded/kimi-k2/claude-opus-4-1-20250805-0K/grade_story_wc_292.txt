<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—scientific certainty vs inherited guilt—are embodied in her grip on the copper nail and her micro-choice to broadcast the coordinates under evacuation alarms. The cost is palpable: she forfeits safety to finish Lydia’s work. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only Hayward’s off-stage voice limits relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (insert nail → islands appear → storm births escape corridor) links by “therefore.” Closure is a decisive change—Elara transmits the hidden routes—paid for by the immediate hurricane threat. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no drift. Cost is on-page: “Outpost Seven’s evacuation alarms wailed.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The weather station’s instruments and the copper nail’s magnetic field constrain every tactical choice; the storm wall’s lights charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—brine stench, oxidized metal, barometric shriek—filtered through Elara’s professional priorities. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to expose the hidden exiles—tightens once the storm’s eye reveals escape beacons. Escalation is causal: decoded stanzas → map shift → evacuation alarm → broadcast. The price is explicit: remaining behind in a collapsing station. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges from the journals, the copper nails, and the storm itself; no direct statement. The final image—nail warm, pointing home—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in “the maps would remember everything now” carries social cost: official amnesia broken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet haunted: “spongey dread… pressed against her ribs like wet wool.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses as alarms wail. No head-hopping; Hayward’s intercom is filtered through Elara’s perception. Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“wet wool,” “phantom lands”) are controlled and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates with the storm. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reversible exile concept, magnetic storm corridors, and copper coffin nails synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. The twist—that storms are rescue windows—feels earned by Lydia’s journals. Specificity of nautical code and jet-stream physics grounds the fantastical. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
