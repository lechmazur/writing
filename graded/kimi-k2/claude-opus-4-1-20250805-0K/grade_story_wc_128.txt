<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot’s shift from detached broker to active courier of compassion is embodied in micro-choices (forwarding the locket, arranging the stop). Interiority is concrete, but the leap from “business complete” to “whispered of cycles” is slightly abstract; still, the final smile feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: misaddressed envelope → broker’s decision → Martha’s return → library revival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Margot’s “best cargo” line crystallizes her new stance with felt cost (time, risk, emotional exposure). One transition (office → island) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Roofless library, salt breeze, starlight—details are selective and filter through Margot’s ledger-trained eye. The setting constrains action (books must be tarped, open sky frames final image) and mirrors internal openness. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring hidden kindness. Pressure tightens when Margot chooses to act on a stranger’s gratitude; the cost is legible (personal time, professional favor, emotional risk). No external antagonist, but internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet, intergenerational compassion emerges through objects and actions rather than statement. Final image of “pages’ whispers like symphony notes” reweights earlier concert motif without moralizing. Subtext in Martha’s tears and Margot’s ledger placement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Margot’s perceptual signature—ledger metaphors, cargo broker idiom. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural (“Personal cargo,” “He kept the library running?”) and advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“tears fell like rain on calm water”) is brief and apt. Occasional elevated diction (“eternal exchange”) fits the reflective closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle: mistaken address as catalyst for communal repair. Roofless library and cargo-broker POV are specific. Tropes of “letter to the dead” and “estranged siblings” are grounded in maritime detail and earned reconciliation.</comment>
