<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative—"her exposed eye tracking the horizon" and scars that "mapped their own boundaries"—but the shift from passive understanding to active consecration feels slightly under-motivated; the prophet’s riddle lands more as thematic prompt than crucible. The final unmasking offers a resonant Earned Stasis, yet the cost (seven years of masked exile) is asserted rather than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the clearings become sanctuaries, the walkers become vessels, and the kinetic parapet’s dance gains purpose. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each consecrated clearing tightens the pattern until the pavilion’s murmur rises in affirmation. The orientation anchor arrives early and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The murmuring pavilion breathes, the kinetic parapet "moves like a living thing," and fountain waters "whisper secrets in twelve ancient tongues"—details that constrain tactics (the walkers must work at night before echoes fade) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the descent through spiral stairs tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echoes—is signaled early and escalates through the night-long consecration marathon. The tightening is one-directional but felt: "wisdom echoes are failing faster than anticipated." Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irreversible removal of the mask.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living architecture, preservation as active labor. The final exchange—"We are the vessels"—offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: removing the mask is both gift and scar-revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent—"whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "conjured clearings" create a coherent lexicon. Perceptual signature is sharp: the half-masked POV notices frequencies "just below human hearing" and tracks peripheral awareness with precision. No head-hop; dialogue is sparse but distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence rhythm modulates with urgency. Occasional elevated diction ("consecrates the spaces between") fits the mythic register. Minor loop risk in "murmuring" repetitions, but each recurrence reweights meaning. No clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—memory-etched moving walls and boundary-walkers who seed reality-pockets—feels fresh yet inevitable. The synthesis of desert myth and archival urgency avoids stock fantasy templates. Risk-taking in mythic compression pays off; no close echoes.</comment>
