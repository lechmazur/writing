<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—repulsion and fascination—are embodied in her “gagging yet inhaling” the rot-ozone air. The clasp’s cold memory-photography externalizes her fear, and her final micro-choice to “break” the mirror of fear is earned by prior embodied stakes. Cornelius-as-guide remains peripheral, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority is specific and un-diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the funhouse goes dark, clasp now shows joy, Mara carries Fear “smaller.” Cost is legible—she now bears Fear forever. Causal lens holds: each beat (reading reversed notes, speaking to child-Fear) tightens options until the paradox shatters the haunt. Orientation is anchored by “seven years dead” and warm mirrors within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mold, sweet-rot stench, and warped mirrors are selective, sensory, and constrain movement; the funhouse itself becomes a living antagonist. Micro-setting of the clasp’s ruby eye finally contains Fear, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography tracks Mara’s palm, the mirrors, and the child-thing’s shifting form without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free herself and the carnival from Fear—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each reversed paradox line tightens the haunt until Mara must confront child-Fear. The tightening forecloses retreat; the cost is permanent custody of Fear. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the shattering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fear’s loneliness and the paradox that fear of fear sustains it. Subtext lives in the clasp’s shifting photographs and Cornelius’s fragmented reflections. Final image—Mara walking out with Fear “almost beautiful in its containment”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: she masters Fear yet never loses it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush, sensorily precise, and consistent: “silk being pulled through broken glass,” “formaldehyde understanding.” Compression and elision are taught early (“technically died”) and paid off. No head-hopping; Cornelius’s speech is distinct in cadence and diction. Psychic distance modulates with stress, tightening under the final paradox.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful, never muddled. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm accelerates into the paradox recitation, then exhales with “morning.” Clean mechanics; no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms the haunted-carnival trope by making Fear a lonely child rather than monster. The photographically cursed mirrors and paradoxical dream dictionary feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—opera clasp fused to skin, bioluminescent mold—anchors universals. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
