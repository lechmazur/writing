<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal-skin is embodied authentically, constraining tactics and revealing interior conflict in three distinct beats; the original rune emerges directly from that trait, making Kira a confident, flawed vessel with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Causal chain tight: stress crystallization → held breath → memory sequence → new rune. Closure reweights the premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens; final beat crystallizes options without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Floating platform tea ceremony functions as micro-setting: swaying stone forces micro-adjustments, steam heat and spatial choreography pressure the act of writing; tactile, specific, and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake crystalized skin-scar as rune intensifies through two beats; final rune creation forces choice that forecloses alternative paths with visible emotional cost, tightening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Stencil-scars into rune embodies theme without naming it; final paragraph reweights stress from burden to language, a resonant reconfiguration that endures ambiguity and lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical control with compressed diction under stress; perceptual signature vivid, crow-quill tremor and crystalline dust strike ascending rhythms. No head-hopping; voice coheres through free indirect style.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Steep density: every line advances stakes or rhythm; occasional purple flourishes around “liquid starlight” forgiven under lyric mode; no loops or redundancy, moonlight-dust payoff crystallizes image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Crystal-scar transformation is non-obvious synthesis crystalized skin → language → empowerment; physical to metaphysical leap feels inevitable. Elliptical structure and quiet risk-taking heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
