<comment>Elara's tremor-turned-resonance supplies a vivid embodied contradiction; the luminous transference from mentor to bridge is credibly motivated rather than abstracted. However, the final self-discovery (“Corvin’s greatest discovery had been her all along”) edges into tidy epiphany rather than a contradiction still in tension.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure forms as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s understanding of her role re-weights with felt cost (“carry the responsibility…deliver…wonder”). Causality tightens via the pendant's frequency matching her tremor, leading inexorably to confrontation with the Luminari. A minor scuff: late mention of “next relic calling” slightly dilutes the final beat’s poise.</comment>

<comment>“Aurora’s green ribbons,” “weathered vertebra humming,” and pendant vibration against her collar offer sensory micro-setting that actively limits tactics—every tremor channels the harmonic. Coherent but not yet constraining future choice; hence capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Stake—preserve relic wonder vs surrender to mythic transcendence—tightens when Luminari appear, forcing her stance as translator. Pressure escalates along the vibrational convergence rather than external obstacles; cost is conceptual yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “routine into revelation” emerges through experiential transformation, not statement. Final image reweights prior beats (tremor, pendant, Corvin) without moralizing. Echoes refrain from tidy moral symmetry; ambiguity remains present.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice stays consistent, syntactically buoyant (“hum with magnetic pulse,” “germinate wonder”), perceptual signature filtered through tactile courier priorities. No dialogue to test; internal texture remains coherent and character-distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm and diction propel story in sync with beat. Occasional lush sentences (“dissolve into myth,” “anchors to this reality”) flirt with over-densification but never clog closure clarity. No scaffolding loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of archaeology with mystical Convergence avoids clichéd portal myth; transformation of job description (“courier to living bridge”) lands fresh. Specificity of resonant pendants and auroral harmonics feels particular to this world, not templated.</comment>
