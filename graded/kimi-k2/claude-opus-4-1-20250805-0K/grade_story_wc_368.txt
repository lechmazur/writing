<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—dye-whispers, heart-rhythm estrangement—and his micro-choice to “teach me” crystallizes a credible shift from passive absorption to active illumination. The granddaughter remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived; Chen functions as mentor, not co-protagonist. Cost is felt: the inherited heart’s weight and the morpho wing’s warning both foreclose the option of hoarding stories. One hairline slip: “quietly explosive” is asserted rather than embodied in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance crystallizes into “transform them, like dye in water,” with the felt cost of perpetual story-flow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of color-narrative increases until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“floating rock tea house”). No causality breaks; the morpho wing’s first appearance seeds the payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating tea house, sun trails, and butterfly wing all constrain choice: the house’s sway demands deliberate motion, the wing’s light-scatter teaches the release tactic. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (dye-master’s chromatic vocabulary). One minor drift: “chains of woven light” remain metaphorical without tactile confirmation. Still, environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear the heart’s story-magnetism—is signaled early and tightens when Chen reveals the donor’s fate. Escalation is accretive: each color whisper adds weight until Kael chooses illumination over absorption. Cost is visible: “he could feel himself growing heavier.” No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories must flow through us, not settle. The morpho wing’s iridescent caution reweights from warning to method without explicit moralizing. Subtext in Chen’s silence after “She learned to illuminate rather than absorb” carries generational grief. Final image of “quietest explosions” offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—perceptual signature of a chromatic artisan (“colors had begun speaking to him in whispers”). Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden (“Teach me”). One near-slip: “valley-mist wonder” edges toward label, yet context justifies it as Chen’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“stories gather like moths to flame”). Minor elevated diction (“iridescent caution”) is earned by context. Final paragraph’s rhythm mirrors the heart’s settling beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—dye-master inheriting a story-collecting heart in a floating tea house—is fresh yet inevitable. Butterfly wing as both heirloom and instruction manual transforms trope into lived ritual. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
