<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is precise and embodied—her proprioceptive calculations feel lived—but the shift from victim to teacher arrives more as thematic assertion than earned micro-choice; the child scene is too brief to test her new stance under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the inverted removal of the strap and the step into the forest reconfigure her options with visible cost (abandoning the station). Accumulative lens holds—pattern of pain-data → reciprocal mercy—without causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The UV forest and pewter strap function as micro-settings that constrain movement and perception; the strap’s weight and the moss’s Fibonacci spirals charge the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate and vivid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—transform pain into mercy—tightens once when she chooses to teach the child; cost is the forfeiture of isolation. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the external threat is off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mathematics of pain/mercy; the final image of teaching patterns in light offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, but the child’s quick trust feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—clinical yet lyrical, matching an enhanced intelligence officer’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with stress; no head-hopping. Compression (“drowning in reverse”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift—“mathematics of mercy” skirts abstraction—but the final cadence justifies it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of enhanced perception and post-war exile; the UV forest and proprioceptive detail feel specific rather than trope. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
