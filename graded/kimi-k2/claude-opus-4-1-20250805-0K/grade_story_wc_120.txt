<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is vivid—her palm on cold glass, breath fogging, the nautilus pressed to her other hand—yet the childhood “memories” remain abstract, blurring the cost of her final stance. The spiral mapping and conducting gestures give her agency, but the emotional contradiction (longing vs. renunciation) is more asserted than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrored horizon folds, fortunes swirl like snow, and Mei conducts the unheard symphony—an earned crystallization that reweights all prior fragments. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each fortune slip and memory shard layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are not mere backdrop; they refract light and time, constraining Mei's perception and enabling the final fold. The nautilus segment functions as micro-setting, its spiral chambers guiding the fortune layout and the climactic conducting gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—becoming conductor of unheard symphonies—is signaled early and tightens as exhaustion looms. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: each fortune slip adds weight until the final swirl forecloses ordinary time. Cost is felt in bodily fatigue and the irreversible shift into eternal now.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of non-linear memory and temporal homesickness emerges through concrete particulars—fortunes that read like reversed memories, the nautilus as time-map—never abstract assertion. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: Mei becomes the conductor of all her scattered whens, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature rooted in synesthetic time: “symphonies in empty concert halls,” “time moved differently for those who could read the space between moments.” Rhythm modulates under pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (factory fired “yesterday—or was it tomorrow?”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned, never muddled. Occasional near-abstractions (“chronologically homesick”) are anchored in embodied action. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor elevation in diction stays within Mei’s heightened perception.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of time-slippage into a lived, sensory experience anchored in the nautilus and fortune slips. The mirrored horizon folding is a fresh visual reconfiguration of temporal collapse. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
