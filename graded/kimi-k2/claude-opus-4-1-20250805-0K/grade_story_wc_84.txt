<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kira’s desire to map is interiorly rich and embodied in every drone maneuver; micro-choice of placing the last chip crystallizes. The pilgrim serves functional pressure but her riddles tilt toward diagnostic voice rather than lived struggle, keeping her just under the 8 band. The final frequency settles into Kira; cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: missing chip gap → chip inserted → tonal closure. Accumulation of pattern and resonant reconfiguration meet the Accumulative/Textural lens; closure lands on page with heard cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Observatory tiles function as tactile puzzle; dusk light acts both as literal limiter and emotional filter for the revelation’s timing—constraining the exact second the message becomes legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“understanding where we belong”—is steadily narrowed as each chip snaps into place, tension held by visible gaps. Pressure tightens exactly once; felt price arrives in the hum that settles bone-deep.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging as cosmic embeddedness emerges through star-pattern glyphs and tonal frequencies, avoiding overt moral. Pilgrim’s spoken thesis just above platitude line causes −0.2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is sensorially sharp, modulating from survey mode to reverent wonder without drifting. Compression (e.g., “brilliant dimness”) teaches its pattern well. Occasional elevated register under stress costs small fraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose sings with rhythm and purpose; every concrete image serves drone angle or tactile placement. Small looped phrasing (“patterns… patterns that”) appears but not near climax; clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Combining ancient printing matrices with drone tech feels non-obvious and specific; synthesis of star maps and belonging frequency carries conceptual heft. Arc is recognizably archeo-acoustic without stock sci-fi gloss.</comment>
