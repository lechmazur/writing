<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—the need for sociable isolation—grounds her motivation.  Her micro-choice to follow each murmuration crystallizes the hierarchy of values: knowledge over company, re-charting lost paths.  Only nudge-down: the polyglot book arrives late as a prop, and the cost she pays feels more conceptual than embodied in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s decision to keep following the light reweights human cartography into shared memory.  Because/therefore linkages stay clean—each stranded luminance is causally tied to starling patterns decoded from the hopscotch cipher; stakes narrow from “discovery” to “rediscovery.”  The single cost—solitude—is present on the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The antique airship isn’t local color; its dying engine forces her winding ritual.  The hopscotch board is micro-setting that constrains her deciphering posture on the deck.  Sensory selection filters through Elara’s cartographer eye—starlings cast shadows, rust maps, tea leaves settle to code.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—chart or forget ancient flightpaths—tightens as each burst of stranded luminance demands adjustment of the wheel.  No reversals beyond pattern recognition are required; the deepening is cumulative: loneliness as tacit admission ticket to the collective map.  The visible price is engine fatigue and days passed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—rediscovery over novelty—emerges through embodied experience; the child’s “How to find your way home” in the margin reframes all prior notation.  Subtext in the final image (light as language, birds as cartographers) lands without abstract speech.  It avoids tidy moralizing; ambiguity remains—she is still traveling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise yet quietly intimate: “Elara smiled, adjusting the ship’s wheel” carries motion and inward charge.  Syntax mirrors the drift—long reflective clauses in calm sky, trimmed fragments under the rush of birds.  POV remains firmly anchored to her sensory world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, compressed, and rhythmic; no paraphrase loops or metaphors muddled under pressure.  “A pulse of golden light suspended...neither spreading nor fading” does sensory duty efficiently.  Paragraph cuts are decisive; each one adds new relation between place, emotion, and task.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>The synthesis—starling murmurations as aerial script—feels inevitable once revealed.  Transformation test passes: the hopscotch + phrasebook constellation cipher is unique and inseparable from world logic.  Slight derivative echo: antique skyship trope, but interior and function are freshly weighted by engine fatigue and timekeeping.</comment>
