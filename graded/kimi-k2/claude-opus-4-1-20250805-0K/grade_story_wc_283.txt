<comment>Mara’s interiority is consistent (‘catalogued by Mara... the hourglass turner... worked in unearthed silence’) and her shift from past-preserver to future-spinner is embodied on-page. Yet she remains too flawlessly prescient—every button-match, resonance, and spiral-layout plays out without missteps or inner contradiction, dulling the felt cost she bears.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/textural lens sustained: the spiral-completion and jar’s release effect a resonant reconfiguration—prophecy transmuted into open possibility. The black-to-gold sand hourglass turn itself stages the decisive change and carries visible conceptual cost (“grains … with the weight of centuries”), satisfying closure gate.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>‘Amber warehouse beneath the cliffs,’ ‘amber-colored glass that caught and held light like frozen honey,’ ‘walls lined with amber-colored glass.’ Setting physically constrains the spiral ritual and radiates the final image, anchoring choice through access, proximity, and luminous echo.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>A single, rising stake: transmute prophecy from fixed fate to raw possibility. Pressure deepens in cascading glow of buttons and hourglasses, tightening the spatial spiral; the climax physically closes the path of determinism. Cost is palpable in the emptied hourglass and centuries-weighted last grain, though escalation is more cumulative than causally dynamic.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme coheres without exposition: “from fixed destination into raw possibility” emerges from the spiral of lost buttons, canyon echo, and glowing amber. It resists moralizing—the warehouse keeps humming with latent futures—but the closing hymn of voice-off-cliff reconfigures prior images with earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Voice sustained through lyrical, amber-filtered diction; occasional elegance creeps toward the purple (‘whispers of possibility itself’). Compression and patterned repetition (“prophecy hidden in the ordinary…”) remain readable and purpose-driven under closure pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Generally smooth with strong rhythmic control and vivid compression. Two near-repeats jar: “shared wisdom trapped within flowing sand / shared wisdom concentrating into a single moment” and mild metaphysical cadence drift like ‘pulverized dreams’ slightly glaze the final peak. Does not reach closure.</comment>

<grade>9.3</question>
<comment>The central conceit—turning hourglasses to keep sand (dreams) from solidifying into fate—is fresh, organic, quietly cosmic. Transformation of lost buttons into cartography of choices and canyon echo as living conduit for infinite voices feels inevitable, risky, and uncannily specific to this singular warehouse.</comment>
