<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her embodied listening, the copper taste of interference—but the “incidental heroism” is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown in-scene, so the final run feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the basement location crystallizes as a Decisive Change, and the fading-then-returning faces on the photograph provide visible cost. Causal chain (SOS rhythm → memory theft → basement) holds under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium is more than backdrop; its suspended-gold light and orchid recoil mirror boundary-thinning and guide Mara’s path. Micro-setting (the photograph warming in her pocket) constrains urgency and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering stolen voices—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph erases faces. One meaningful escalation: the SOS pulse narrowing to basement location. Cost is felt via the shriek-to-dirge shift and the warming photograph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of stolen memory and guardianship emerges through concrete events; the final image of “seventeen hearts remembered how to speak” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing. Subtext in the slowed birthday dirge is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is atmospheric yet precise—“mist curled…like breath through broken teeth”—with consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue, but free-indirect interiority stays coherent; patterned elision (e.g., “the Silence”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “she’d learned that twilight was when…” but no loops or register drift. Final cadence accelerates cleanly into the run.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Emotional-contagion tracer and memory-harvesting care home feel fresh; tropes are transformed through sensory specificity. The slowed SOS heartbeat as dirge is an inventive turn that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
