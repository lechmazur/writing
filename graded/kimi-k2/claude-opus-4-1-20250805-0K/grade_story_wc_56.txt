<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—running from her father’s lies while chasing others’—is embodied in the sundial and crystallizes in the final resolve to confront him. Micro-choice (pocketing the dial, standing to dock) signals the cost of abandoning thirty years of evasion. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present stance. Flaw (evasion) complicates every beat and is accepted, not balanced away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s lesson reframes her entire quest, cost is the forfeiture of future legend-chasing. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mirrored confessions tightens until the final image reweights the premise. No causality breaks; all props track. Orientation anchored by 120-word mark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Canal twilight functions as micro-setting: mirror-black water and silent hour strip away tourist noise, forcing introspection. Magere Brug’s reflection creates the impossible shadow that cues the epiphany. Sensory selection (dying light, brass glint) is POV-filtered and purposeful. Setting constrains the final choice—no escape route except home.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage truth from her own architecture of lies—signaled early via van der Meer’s quote. One meaningful tightening: the confession letter collapses the external quest into an internal reckoning. Cost is the surrender of lifelong evasion; agency is the decision to dock and face her father. Escalation is textural density increase, not causal reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from mirrored deceptions (van der Meer, father, self) without moralizing. Final image—sundial catching bridge light—reweights the premise: every legend was a mirror. Subtext lives in gesture (turning the dial, pocketing it). Complexity preserved: no tidy absolution for father or self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, with distinct perceptual signature: “mirror-black water,” “serene upheaval.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Free indirect style stays clean. Register consistent with seasoned archaeologist’s lexicon. Final cadence shift from expansive reflection to decisive action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“architecture of lies”) is earned and singular. Strong verbs (“drifted,” “salvage,” “forfeit”) drive momentum. No register drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor echo of “twilight” twice within 30 words, not at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar quest-for-truth frame is transformed through personal archaeology and mirrored confessions. Specificity of Dutch canal, VOC history, and sweatshop revelation grounds the universal. Risk taken in quiet, interior closure rather than external discovery. Fresh inflection: the legend was always the self.</comment>
