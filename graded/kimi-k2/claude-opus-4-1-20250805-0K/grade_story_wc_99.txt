<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji’s grief and restraint are embodied in every micro-choice—his fingers on lace, the pause before speaking, the withheld apology—yet the student remains a sketch, diluting relational crucible pressure. The final renunciation (“tomorrow, I would write”) is earned by the tide of memory and the compass’s cerulean stab, carrying visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass points to an impossible color that crystallizes Kenji’s stance and reconfigures the emotional stakes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lace row, compass tremor, and juniper cut layers density until the final image reweights everything with the cost of unsent words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-washed islet, salt breeze, and ghost-ship compass function as micro-setting that constrains Kenji’s choices; the compass’s weight and cerulean hue charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, sensory detail selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kenji break his silence with Yuki—tightens once when the compass needle stops spinning, forcing the tacit decision to write tomorrow. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; the cost is the ache of cerulean regret made visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited silence and the possibility of repair emerges through lace code, compass, and pruned juniper without moralizing. The final image—the bell across the water—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tidal, and character-specific; the rhythmic placidity mirrors Kenji’s restraint while allowing micro-shifts under pressure. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence advancing atmosphere or interiority; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined, never overwrought, and the final cerulean image lands with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bonsai, wartime lace code, and ghost-ship compass feels fresh and inevitable; the cerulean regret color is a specific, non-obvious invention that crystallizes theme. Risky compression pays off.</comment>
