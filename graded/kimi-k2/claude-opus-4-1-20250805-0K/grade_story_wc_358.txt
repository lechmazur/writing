<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s adaptability is embodied through methodical foresight and cost-bearing choices; interiority is precise, toolkit-driven rather than abstract. The patch pick-up intertwines motive with escalating inquiry, anchoring a quiet but earned resilience. No generic science-voice intrudes; every reflection settles into mechanical detail and bodily fatigue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A causal, relentlessly narrowing plot: each beat (patch, smoke, warped containers) telescopes risk inward. Closure lands as earned concept-shift—new global protocols emerge from the convergence rather than via thaumaturgy. No orientation drift; anchors remain continuous and threshold-legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Port labyrinth is both obstacle and magnetic map: containers lean, bend, fingerprint wind. Micro-settings (digits, anemometer, disturbed coins) constrain every footfall and tighten spatial pressure. Metallic scent and dust under fingernails root the esoteric in sweat and rust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Singular convergence reweights options at each survey beat; removing it collapses the ending’s time-dilation logic and Maya’s final cautionary charge. Escalation is interior yet planetary: documentation, geometry, protocol evolution. Stakes manifest in irrecoverable hours and shrinking six-month runway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme refracts through scientific detachment confronting physics rupture; final image turns data-gathering into a communal early-warning mandate. Non-literal resonance crystallizes without sermon; hazy precision becomes communal foresight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poised scientific diction never lapses into jargon gabble; anemometer clicks, "recursive wind" fold syntax to pressure. Patch description via tactile friction—wings snag dusty corrugated iron. POV stays narrow, eyes-narrowed, no head-hops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with proximity to the vortex; dust particles glint under late light, no ornamental metaphor. One loop ("dust-colored dust") is caught and deleted internally, inflecting not drumming pattern; clarity sharp during closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Convergence-meets-science-survey angle feels non-obvious and inevitable; no prior narrative template. Hazy-precision tone gives wind the last word, charging prior mechanics into ethical mandate. Risk heightens stakes without violating physics learned from prior beats.</comment>
