<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—bone-deep memory of tundra, “brittle awakening” embodied in sternum vibration—yet her final stance (“coexist with absence”) arrives more as lyrical assertion than earned micro-choice; no concrete cost is dramatized on the page. Marcus functions as gentle chorus, not pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kira re-weights her purpose from isolation to chosen coexistence, crystallized in the sundial’s new shadow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layer (cloud floor, stone hum, brass reflection) deepens meaning until the final cadence shift. One felt cost (loss of prior identity) is implied but not made visceral on the page, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Clouds rolled beneath the glass floor like forgotten seas” instantly anchors the impossible library; the brass sundial’s atomic reflection constrains Kira’s perception of time and self, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—glacier scrape remembered in bone needles. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signals early and tightens via the hum’s rising resonance. One meaningful deepening: Kira realizes the purpose is coexistence, not replication. Cost is conceptual (extinction’s wisdom carried forward) rather than visceral, limiting the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: extinction not as loss to reverse but as wisdom to integrate. Subtext in the sundial’s first shadow—her modern body finally solid enough to cast one—reweights memory without moralizing. Final image (“space between what was lost and what could still be found”) offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent—compression like “atomically reflective surface” taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is Kira’s: tundra memory, glacier grammar. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is spare and subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—“glaciers scraped the world clean” carries three jobs. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Occasional elevated diction (“anachronisms,” “conceptual”) slightly above mammoth-herder lexicon but consistent with curator persona. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—reincarnated bearers of extinct wisdom—feels fresh, synthesized through Kira’s specific grief and the tidal library’s physics. Risky lyric structure holds; final reconfiguration of extinction as coexistence is non-obvious yet inevitable. No derivative echoes.</comment>
