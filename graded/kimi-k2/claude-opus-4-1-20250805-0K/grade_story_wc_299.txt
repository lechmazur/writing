<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinical detachment vs. visceral memory—are embodied in the tactile handling of the cloth; the final choice to authenticate from lived loss rather than paperwork is earned and carries visible cost (reputation risk, emotional exposure). Interiority is specific and character-bound, avoiding therapy-speak. The only minor slip is a slightly abstract “longing not as emptiness but as space” that edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s phone call crystallizes a new stance—translation of loss instead of escape—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The cloth’s remembered texture triggers the decisive shift; cost is legible in the phrase “authority of someone who’d earned his expertise through loss.” Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The quarry trailer’s acoustic properties (fluorescent hum in B-flat, limestone walls swallowing sound) constrain Marcus’s perception and echo the vanished stage monitors, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the green pools reflecting nothing mirror his shame. One minor drift: “amphitheater carved from earth” leans symbolic rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Marcus can still trust his own ear—tightens when the cloth’s texture contradicts his public failure. The escalation is textural: each observation compresses fibers into lived nights, forcing the choice to authenticate from memory. Cost is felt in the moment he abandons the safety of paperwork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as performance, history as vibration. The final image of the quarry holding echoes reframes the earlier hum and cloth as secular relics. No moralizing; the resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—roadie’s technical lexicon fused with elegiac cadence. Syntax mirrors Marcus’s oscillation between precision and ache: “confidently uncertain” is both diagnosis and self-mockery. No POV drift; compression is purposeful and paid off in the closing line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers job and memory (“discoloration pattern consistent with exposure to stage lighting, 2000-4000 hours estimated use”). No loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “the way venues once held their music” could trim, but it lands early and doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—failed expert authenticating his own past through a scrap of cloth—feels fresh and inevitable. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric resolution rather than a set-piece confrontation; the payoff justifies the choice. No derivative echoes.</comment>
