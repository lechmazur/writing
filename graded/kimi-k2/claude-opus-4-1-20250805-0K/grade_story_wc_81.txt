<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation to preserve truth against systemic erasure is embodied in tactile micro-choices—touching spines, isolating frequencies, stamping pages. The contradiction between her quiet resolve and the ticking blackout clock creates credible pressure. Her final ascent with the stamp shows earned endurance and cost: she must leave the truth submerged until the next blackout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The blackout’s silence allows pattern detection; each stamped page accumulates toward a reconfiguration of historical truth. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira seals the volumes, planning the next descent—cost is the ongoing guardianship and deferred revelation. Causality holds: blackout → detection → marking → inevitable re-submergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drowned library is not backdrop; its algae-lit silence and electromagnetic hum actively enable and then foreclose Mira’s method. The vacuum-sealed volumes’ vibration frequencies are a micro-setting that dictates tactics. Final image—algae pulsing around sealed truth—recharges the setting as eternal guardian.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving authentic memory against corporate erasure. Pressure tightens as blackout time dwindles; each stamped page narrows the window and raises the cost of incomplete work. One decisive intensification: electromagnetic pulse ends detection. Cost is visible—she must ascend with the job unfinished.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: truth survives in quiet, deliberate acts, not in digital noise. Subtext in the altered water-rights treaties indicts profit without preaching. Final image of algae-protected ink offers resonant, non-moralizing answer—truth waits in the dark.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, precise, sensorily acute—fitting a lone indexer in a drowned cathedral of knowledge. Syntax lengthens during discovery, shortens under time pressure. Phosphorescent, vacuum-sealed, discordant—vocabulary is controlled and purposeful. No dialogue; interior monologue stays modest and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “green-blue glow pulse,” “surgically replaced specific entries.” No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (algae as eternal pulse) are coherent and earned. Rhythm modulates with urgency. High information density; every sentence advances discovery or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-climate-apocalypse noir with a librarian detective who reads books by their vibration. Corporate erasure via selective forgery feels new. The drowned library and algae-ink symbiosis are specific, irreplaceable. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
