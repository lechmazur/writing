<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs oracle, disclosure vs concealment—are dramatized in embodied micro-choices (smudging the signature, taping the drawing to the margin). The final renunciation of official report for secret preservation is earned by the fever-borne cost and carries visible price. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded; no stock phrasing. Minor slip: “second, wiser heart” edges toward tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of hidden illustrations → aurora → new drawing tightens meaning with cadence shift. Closure is Charged Poise: Mira’s smudged drawing taped to the margin crystallizes her stance and forecloses official disclosure; cost is the swallowed truth she must carry alone. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One transition (nightfall) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Station Seven’s altitude, condensation-curled paper, and magnetometer readings constrain every move. The aurora’s “intimate sorrow” physically enables the flowers and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static catalog. Micro-setting (window margin) becomes the charged site of closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve or expose impossible flowers—is signaled by the hidden illustration. Escalation is one deepening: fever dream → aurora → witnessing bloom → decision to conceal. Cost is the irreversible swallowing of truth and exile from official record. Agency is renunciation; coincidence (aurora timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fault-tolerant knowledge living in margins emerges organically from Mira’s choices and the flowers’ biology. Final image of smudged drawing taped to window margin offers non-literal answer: some truths survive only by partial erasure. No moralizing; ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. Recurring motif of “swallowed truth” reweights from fever to aurora to heart.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision (“magnetometer fluctuations”) braided with lyric oracle diction (“electromagnetic sorrow”). Rhythm modulates with altitude pressure; no head-hopping. POV modesty maintained—she “peripherally” senses before full recognition. Compression (“weight of aurora light on mountain petals”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“grief made visible”). Strong verbs and specific nouns throughout. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors aurora retreat. Minor scaffold in “she understood now” could trim, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fault-tolerant oracle meets alpine botany meets auroral physics, all grounded in Mira’s embodied dilemma. Hidden botanical illustrations as clandestine archive is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (flowers that exist only during magnetic storms) commits fully without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
