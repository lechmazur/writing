<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her final “belonging” insight is declared rather than dramatized; the burnt-feather cue is evocative yet never forces a visible micro-choice that costs her anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mira’s palm on the glass crystallizes her stance with felt awe—but the causal chain from feather to luminous respite is more associative than because/therefore; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned city’s bioluminescent arteries and glass-bubble dome are vivid, selective, and directly constrain what can be observed; the setting’s glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through rising light and gathering creatures, but no single beat forces Mira to relinquish or risk anything concrete, so cost remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging to cosmic cycles emerges organically from Mira’s patient attention; the ending’s hush reweights the premise without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature that filters every detail through Mira’s astrological lens; no head-hop, and rhythmic control tightens under the dome’s wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and image-dense; occasional lyrical surplus (“shadowseam wonder”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum or muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing landscape astrology with living coral ruins feels fresh and inevitable; the burnt-feather relic bridges centuries without contrivance, and the piece commits fully to its mythic science.</comment>
