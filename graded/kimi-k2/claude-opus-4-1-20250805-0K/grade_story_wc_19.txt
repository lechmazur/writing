<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—hunger for open air vs inherited bunker reflex—is embodied in her micro-choices (hand on glass, uncorking vials). The porcelain doll’s sprout is the earned pivot that converts claustrophobia into expansion, paid for by the doll’s fracture and the satchel’s weight. Backstory is minimal, tied to present stakes via grandmother’s whisper and father’s absence. Emotional arc is specific, not therapeutic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance toward safety flips from compression to sprawl, crystallized in the final image of bringing a vial back to her father. Causal chain: grandmother’s gift → doll sprouts during inversion → silence harvested → choice to share. Orientation is anchored by line 2 (“three miles above Earth”) and reinforced through sensory cues. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (density of silences) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The trellis is not mere postcard; its golden lattice literally sings under strain and hosts the inversion that enables the doll’s sprout. Clouds as “inverted mountains” and the crystallizing silence provide tactile specificity. The setting constrains the only possible harvest and charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as gravity flips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting silence vs inherited fear of openness—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: inversion tightens the window to forty minutes, forcing the harvest. Cost is the irreversible fracture of the doll and the weight of the vials. Agency is active (uncorking, dancing with gravity). No coincidence resolves; the doll’s sprout is foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety as expansion rather than contraction. The porcelain doll’s bloom literalizes the idea without sermon. Final image of the girl “sprouting toward wonder” reweights the bunker metaphor. No thematic echo in dialogue; resonance is imagistic. Complexity is preserved—father is not converted, merely offered a taste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “hush before lightning strikes,” “honey-copper sweetness.” Perceptual signature is Mira’s synesthetic tasting of silence. Syntax modulates with gravity shift—short clauses under inversion pressure. No dialogue, so no register clash. POV remains tightly interior, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“cathedral of quiet”). Rhythm accelerates during inversion, breathes during aftermath. No filter-verb stacks. Final line lands with crystallized cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—harvesting silence during gravity inversion—is non-obvious yet fully committed. Tropes (porcelain doll, wise grandmother) are transformed through the sprouting mechanic. Specificity of “gilded hush” and “flavor of pre-dawn stillness” prevents generic fantasy drift. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
