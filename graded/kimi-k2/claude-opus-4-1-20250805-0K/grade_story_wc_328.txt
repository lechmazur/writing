<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid—arrowhead warmth, gravity laughter—but her final “I’ll join them” leap feels slightly under-cooked; Thorne’s grief is embodied in trembling soil, yet his release is told more than dramatized. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. reunion) are present but compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: accepting metamorphosis reweights the entire premise. Causal chain (arrowhead → phone static → acceptance) holds under a Hybrid lens, but the cost—Marina’s forfeiture of human identity—could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground garden’s bioluminescent roots and floating soil actively constrain movement and mirror the theme; the gravity pockets are not mere backdrop but shape every beat. Specificity is high, yet the cavern’s scale occasionally drifts toward the generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing or preventing the metamorphosis—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes grief is the anchor. One clear turn: grief must be released. Cost is legible but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-loss emerges organically from the Thunderbird myth and Thorne’s lavender smoke. The cosmic-joke reframe is earned, yet the final line edges toward articulating the theme rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured—scientific precision braided with mythic cadence. POV stays locked to Marina; perceptual signature is strong (“gravity pocket pull at her bones”). Occasional lyric inflation (“frostbitten hope bloomed”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic, with high information density. One paraphrase loop (“the cosmic joke wasn’t cruel—it was revolutionary”) and a mixed metaphor (“laughter made physical”) nudge it below the 8.5 tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Thunderbird-as-metamorphic-force rather than predator is a fresh angle; the gravity garden and static confessions synthesize folklore with speculative physics. Risky compression succeeds, though the cosmic-joke payoff flirts with abstraction.</comment>
