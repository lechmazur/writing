<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pruning-needle care for threads mirrors her garden tending—but the final renunciation (planting the fragment) is more stated than dramatized, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of encoded grief tightens through tapestry decoding until the final image reweights the entire cemetery as “another garden path.” Closure lands with conceptual cost—time suspended, chess clock stilled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt silo, midnight roses, and starlight are selective, sensuous, and thematically charged; the silo’s hollow throat echoing the clock’s click becomes the resonant chamber that reframes the graveyard as living tapestry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor the dead—escalates as tapestry threads reveal prior mourners’ devotions, tightening Marta’s resolve; cost is the surrender of measured time (clock left unwound) and the fragment itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-gardening emerges organically from tactile acts; final image of “velveteen gloom” and borderless garden path offers resonant, non-moralizing answer to how love survives flesh.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, grave-tender voice is consistent and distinctive; perceptual signature filters every detail through Marta’s gardener’s gaze—threads as root systems, wind as applause—without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, rhythms breathe with scene pressure; only minor scaffold (“she would,” “she understood”) keeps it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cemetery as living quilt, sovereign case as reliquary of encoded grief, gardener as decoder—risky lyric structure pays off in inevitable final image.</comment>
