<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin’s interior contradiction—scientific quantifier vs. presence seeker—drives every beat; the shell transfer crystallizes his renunciation with embodied cost. Mira’s single gesture reconfigures their shared history without exposition. Micro-choice of crushing the pocket-sun seals the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crushed sun’s outward bloom reweights the premise from capture to release. Causal chain—mentor’s riddle → seven years of absence-selling → Mira’s breath-gift → renunciation—holds cleanly. Cost is visible in the irreversible loss of the starfire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ember nexus heat and volcanic glass constrain stance and movement; the glowing fissures mirror Corin’s internal pressure. Shell-as-micro-setting carries final charge. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to preserve presence without killing it”—tightens through each beat until the decisive release. Escalation is textural: density of regret accumulates until the shell’s re-breathing reconfigures options. No reversals needed; deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: presence is weight only when shared, never when bottled. Final image of light spreading outward revalues the entire prior pattern without moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s “late” and the deliberate hand-brush carries the emotional freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-scientific, precise yet romantic: “compressed light without context, heat without hearth.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; short clauses under stress, longer coils in reflection. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Corin.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Metaphors are fresh and integrated—“palette of resolve,” “luminous veins”—never ornamental. Sentence variety supports momentum; no loops or scaffold. Final line’s cadence releases tension cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Pocket-sun alchemy and nautilus-heart shell synthesize into a non-obvious meditation on presence. Risky lyric compression pays off in the closure image. Premise feels inevitable yet wholly new.</comment>
