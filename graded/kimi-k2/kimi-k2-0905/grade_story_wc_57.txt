<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ari’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her pulse warming the beads, reverence planting the seed—but the harbormaster remains a bureaucratic prop rather than a crucible, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Ari’s theft and planting crystallize the stakes, the green shoot through snow embodying conceptual cost. Causal chain from lightning strike to seed survival is tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden dock, fulgurite crust, and fog-damp rope constrain every move; the vitrified marline literally guides Ari’s decoding and becomes the cradle for the final sprout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the storm-corn method—tightens when the last weaver dies and the harbormaster threatens confiscation. Ari’s agency (cracking the bead, planting in forbidden wood) forecloses surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of heritage-as-living-seed emerges wordlessly through the rope’s language and the shoot’s defiant growth; no moralizing, only embodied resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, textured prose sustains a hushed, tidal rhythm; POV remains anchored in Ari’s winter-kelp gaze without head-hop. Compression like “infinitely patient” fits her mythic stature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (whale-bone dock, harbor moons) are selective and purposeful; no loops or scaffold. High information density—“brittle rosary of sky-fire” compresses physics and ritual in four words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fusing meteorological vitrification with mnemonic knot-language feels fresh and inevitable; the storm-corn’s salt-drinking biology and rope-embedded lore transform familiar eco-fantasy into singular myth.</comment>
