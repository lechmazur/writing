<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ari’s patience, embodied in tactile micro-choices (warming the fulgurite knot, cracking the bead), drives every beat; the final planting is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the last seed, exile from the dock). Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. The single contradiction—risking the seed to save the method—charges the climax. Status tension with the harbormaster is brief but sharp, forcing the decisive retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the planted storm-corn rewrites the official “nothing can grow here” rule. Causal chain holds—rope decoded → seed planted → dock claimed. Orientation is immediate; fog and golden planks anchor by line 3. One transition (dock to skiff) is legible and tight. Persistent constraint: the rope’s fragility and the single seed shape every tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and vitrified rope form a micro-setting that constrains every move: the glazed fibers can shatter, the dock planks accept the seed. Sensory hierarchy is Ari’s—she notices tide-slap, barnacled posts, harbor moons in silica. Spatial choreography is clean; boots crunch, skiff ghosts. Weather actively muffles pursuit and midwifes the escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the storm-corn method—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the last tide-weaver dies. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded knot raises the cost of failure. Agency crystallizes in the irreversible planting; the harbormaster’s injunction complicates but does not resolve. Felt price: loss of the seed and permanent exile from the dock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: heritage is living seed, not artifact. Subtext lives in silence—the ocean’s hush memorizes the song, the fog erases the bureaucrat. Final image of green shoot through snow reweights all prior rope-lore without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the corn survive? The cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, tuned to Ari’s perceptual signature: “infinitely patient,” “harbor moons,” “brittle rosary of sky-fire.” Syntax mirrors her slow coaxing—long sentences breathe, then fracture with the bead crack. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-rich: “Heritage is a seed, not a glass case.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—fulgurite as “harbor moons,” rope as “sleeping serpent.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening and closing lines bookend with sonic echo: “creaked like whale-bone” / “one pulse at a time.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—tide-scribes encoding culture in rope-knots—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Lightning-vitrified marline as data-storage is specific, non-obvious, and grounded. Transformation test fails if dock or seed is swapped; the weave of glass, salt, and song is irreplaceable. Risk in lyric density pays off: the hush becomes character.</comment>
