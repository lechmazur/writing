<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“blank-faced” never lapses into label-speak); contradictory impulses (reporting neighbors vs forging coupons) are dramatized in the present whittling beat. Micro-choices (shaving angle, labeling the scrape “dirge”) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation—planting bare stems—earns cost via prior causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the planted stems, wooden feather, and single tear crystallize options without tidy resolution. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of whittling → gifting → planting reweights the remade hush with undeniable cost. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (porch, turbines, fence) remain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Farmhouse porch, turbines, and crow form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: wind snatches shavings, blades cast shadows, fence becomes perch. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound (scent of nothing, turbine groan). Final image of stems planted at turbine foot ties setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief under silence ordinance—tightens via escalating risk: first the hidden microphone, then the crow’s demand, finally the officer’s presence. Each whittled gift raises stakes; cost is the irreversible scattering of petals and the real tear that darkens soil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: remade hush as both oppression and medium for new song. Subtext in crow’s request and officer’s unbuttoned badge reframes survival guilt. Final image of flag made from empty wrapper offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, ritualistic, and POV-locked; “Item:” litany and seventeen-degree angle feel performer-specific. Compression (“television left on after the station signed off”) teaches pattern early. No head-hopping; officer’s dialogue is distinct, stripped, and subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“heartbeat like vandalism”) are precise. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under turbine whoosh, longer cadences during planting. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-mandate grief farm with wind-turbine liturgy feels unprecedented. Whittled rebellion against enforced hush synthesizes dystopia and pastoral elegy. Crow’s wooden feather lodged in turbine joint is a fresh inflection that reweights the entire premise.</comment>
