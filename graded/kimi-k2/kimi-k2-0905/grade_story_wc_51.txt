<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The weaver’s interior contradiction—collector of others’ grief who refuses her own—drives every beat; the sister-memory cuts her finger and re-weights the lattice, paying the visible cost that earns release. No stock labels; every emotion is embodied in antler-loom, amber thread, violet flare. Final renunciation (leaving the lamp) is causally tied to the confession; flaw becomes the price of valley-saving. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grotto unfolds only after her obsidian confession, violet flare, and blood on wick—undeniable cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern taught early (sevenfold symmetry, recursive reflections) and paid off in final image of infinite forgiving faces. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint: the lamp left behind becomes a new sun, foreclosing return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bronze grotto’s recursive curvature and shingled hush physically trap breathing and force the confession; the cracked lamp chimney and violet flame are handled in multiple beats, altering tactics. Starlight shaft at closure recharges every copper reflection. Environment, tool, and body (cut finger) together constrain the final weave. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—valley collapse—signaled early; pressure tightens when silence grows heavy and lamp sputters, forcing the sister confession. One meaningful deepening: shift from collecting others’ burdens to surrendering her own. Cost legible in blood-obsidian sheet and abandoned lamp. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: only by surrendering the heaviest personal grief can the communal lattice hold. Final image of solidified-light lamp reweights earlier flame beats without moralizing. Subtext of forgiveness loops through infinite sister reflections. Resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays tight to weaver’s perceptual bias—whalebone hush, auric note, moth-wing sheets. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breathing alignment; diction metallic and winter-edged. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Patterned elision (“boundary-lessly”) taught early and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay internally consistent—bronze, amber, violet, starlight—without mixed metaphors. High density: “calcifying the air into thin translucent sheets that floated like moth wings” does world, sense, and stakes in one stroke. Rhythm modulates from hush-hiss to flare-sigh, matching pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fractal grief-weaving in a bronze recursive grotto is fresh; transforms familiar “carry your trauma” trope into literal lattice-work that holds a valley. Risk-taking in lyric compression and sevenfold symmetry pays off in closure. Specificity of obsidian sheet cut by finger-blood makes the abstract visceral. Concept commits fully—no retreat to metaphor.</comment>
