<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The confession of abandoning her sister supplies a raw, on-page cost that tilts the final choice (Earned Stasis). Interiority is visceral—the cut finger, the drop of blood—but at times drifts into abstract rapture (“forgiving… repeating into infinity”), blunting contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice stabilizes only after the weaver surrenders her own weight, her sister’s face cycling into infinite absolution. Structure is one uninterrupted scene; orientation is immediate. Lens holds as accumulative/textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bronze cavern folds into living agency—walls “peel back like petals.” Recurrent “shingled hush” reappears in the final sealing, charging the closure. Sensory precision (auric metallics, violet flare) outruns momentary spatial haziness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—valley collapse—is always felt beneath the interior ritual. Escalation is a single, deepening surrender: “only by giving weight to her own burden could the lattice hold,” paid with blood and sister-memory. No reversals, but stakes tighten and foreclose retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of reciprocal burden emerges through image (“mandala of sorrow balanced by release”) rather than assertion. The final violet reflection quietly reweights guilt into absolution, resonant without a moral tag.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Lyrical compression is deliberate and legible; whale-bone quietness, metallic hush, recur as patterned refrain. Syntax mirrors fractal recursion without obscuring sequence. Absence of dialogue costs nothing; voice carries alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Metaphors sometimes stack into faint poetic overload (“taste of winter” + “whalebones” in one breath) yet never blur cause. Few near-duplicates; information density is high. Rhythm escalates then calms in mirrored breathing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Folk–sci-fi hybrid: fractal weaver meets mythic metallurgy. Re-imaging guilt as physical tessellation is non-obvious and fully internalized. Specificity—antler loom, bronze petals—anchors universals, transformation test passed.</comment>
