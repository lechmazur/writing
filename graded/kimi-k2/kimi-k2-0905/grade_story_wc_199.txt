<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mireya’s quiet, methodical interiority and embodied micro-choices (counting seeds to calm herself, pressing moon-dust monuments to anchor leaves) stay consistent and specific; the climactic utterance “Reciprocity” is earned by her steady, escalating risk on the drifting arbor. Flaw: no contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene to deepen tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor descends and rain returns the moment she names the forgotten covenant. Causal chain—collect syllables → build monuments → speak name → restore balance—holds cleanly under a Causal lens with visible cost (risk of drifting above cloudline).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is not mere backdrop; its rising drift and final descent physically constrain Mireya’s tactics and charge the closure. Sensory specificity (“cold soot that tasted of old thunder”) is selective and POV-filtered; micro-setting of bark, leaves, and floating height is tracked without spatial confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—decode the folktale before the arbor ascends forever—tightens with each leaf caught; the cost of height and dwindling time is visceral. One clear reversal: final leaf completes the cipher and triggers the covenant’s return. Agency remains hers throughout; luck complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges organically from seed-sorting labor and the forgotten covenant; no moralizing statement intrudes. The closing image—rain tasting of nettle and iron—reweights all prior motifs (dust, leaves, monuments) into a resonant, non-literal answer to the land’s thirst.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice with mossy, earthy diction (“humming a mossy delight of a tune that sounded like green returning to burnt soil”) remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Mireya’s seed-sorter precision and quiet awe. Syntax modulates with altitude tension.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and patterned (“leaves unblighted,” “sap rise like a question”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor elevated phrasing (“ochre and veined like a tiny map”) stays within lyrical register and does not stall momentum.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Folklore-as-cipher delivered by floating chestnut leaves feels fresh and inevitable; the moon-dust monuments to forgotten things synthesize memory, magic, and agrarian labor in a way only this story could execute. Risky arboreal setting pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
