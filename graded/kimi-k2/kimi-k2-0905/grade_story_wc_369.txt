<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her split thumbnail healed by moonlight, her whispered apology to the astronomer—but the final shift from maintenance worker to quiet listener feels slightly under-motivated; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the parapet. The embodied sorrow and tactile handling of the sextant show clear micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the sextant’s transformation into cedar is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise (quantified sorrow → ordinary time). Causality holds—each dream bead lowers sorrow index until moonlight completes the transmutation. Cost is felt in the astronomer’s absence and the cedar’s numbered leaves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The stormlit tower is no backdrop; moonlight actively heals stone and brass, constraining Mara’s repair tactics. The parapet chalk grid and spectral numbered trees charge the final image, making environment inseparable from choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore balance by deconstructing sorrow—tightens as each dream lowers the index. One clear deepening: the cedar’s rings reveal personal loss (mother’s linden), crystallizing cost. Agency remains with Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: human quantification of nature’s grief is quietly undone by living wood. The cedar’s cones rolling down the stairs offer a non-literal answer—second chances through listening, not measuring—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “beads of mercury” and “constellations of sorrow” are character-filtered. Patterned compression (“lightning forked; for an instant…”) teaches the reader to accept lyric leaps. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Mara’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. The final cadence—“tiny sextants, offering second chances”—rewards the ear and recharges the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of arboriculture, grief measurement, and moonlit alchemy feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the cedar’s numbered leaves transform a familiar eco-parable into singular myth.</comment>
