<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hourglass turner's interior contradiction—obedience to prophecy vs. will to re-sew it—drives every micro-choice (grouping buttons, uncorking the jar, pocketing two). Embodied emotion (boots crunching, feeling weight return) anchors motive without label-speak. The final renunciation of her tower role carries visible cost in the cracked glass she leaves behind. Voice and worldview remain distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral of buttons re-threads prophecy into collective possibility, with the empty jar now holding refined choice rather than sand. Causality is tight—each beat (cataloging, uncorking, resealing) flows because/therefore under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate: copper sky, amber warehouse, cracked tower all anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint: the cracked lower bulb that first leaked fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Environment (amber beams, fossilized honey) constrains perception and action—light filters choices, resin fixes time. The warehouse itself becomes micro-setting: pine plank, resinous floor, buttons as constellations. Spatial choreography is flawless: spiral walked, center occupied, path back to tower. Final image of molten glass walls charges the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether prophecy ends in narrowing or reassembly—is signaled in the cracked bulb and escalates as each button re-threads a life. One decisive tightening: the spiral’s completion forces her stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the weight of choice she now carries and the tower she abandons. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from buttons’ silent testimony: endings are fabric awaiting reassembly. Subtext lives in gesture—uncorking silence, pocketing two buttons. Final image of hovering grains reweights the premise without moralizing. Resonance is earned through specific particulars, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey.” Perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic—sound tastes of iron, silence settles like dust. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during spiral construction, slowing into dawn hush. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the turner.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—“fossilized honey,” “needle-like tower”—and never muddle causality. High information density: buttons grouped by grief-pitch, spiral as generations. Final line breathes with earned cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of re-threading prophecy via lost buttons is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test: could not swap buttons for coins or shells without breaking logic. Fresh inflection: silence as teachable material. Risk in lyric mode pays off; closure remains legible.</comment>
