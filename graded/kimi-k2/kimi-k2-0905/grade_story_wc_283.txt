<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is the unique through-line: her decision to unscramble the broken future replaces the monastery’s fix-it directive, and her cataloging of buttons with felt stakes (prophecy → re-sewing) shows interiority earning a quiet but costly renunciation at the spiral’s center.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure turns on the canyon echo re-entering the jar as refined possibility, irrevocably re-weighting the broken future’s prophecy; causality is tight (because buttons → stories → silence) and the lens (textural reconfiguration) holds to the final hush.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber warehouse’s resin beams channel dusk into honey-like memory while enormous button tables create micro-pressure—each stroll among cloister shadows forecloses a fix-it path; the closing molten glass wall image crystallizes the unearthed silence as reconfiguring atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prophecy’s ‘world narrows to a thread’ pressure escalates via buttons’ loss-stories tightening tactics; the quiet spiral’s pauses deepen cost, culminating in a stance crystallization that spins the broken future into breathable possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme that endings are raw fabric awaiting reassembly emerges from the concrete spiral of buttons and the canyon echo’s silence—that shared wisdom reweighted at closure without a neat moral, only the quiet invitation to co-sew.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person interiority is filtered through tactile description (“footstep sounded like a secret swallowed”) and perceptual bias toward salvage; consistent voice modulates under pressure until the final unearthed silence—no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paragraph-level cadence accelerates under the spiral count, balanced item clauses, zero loops: “buttons crunching on plastic four-hole squares and carved nacre” propels without over-writing; figurative language (fossilized honey) stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Transforming discarded buttons into an open-collar future offers a fresh synthesis of familiar up-cycling tropes; the unearthed silence as garment feels inevitable, though the concept’s repurposing edges toward symbolic convenience late in reprise.</comment>
