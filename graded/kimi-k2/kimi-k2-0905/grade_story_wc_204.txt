<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Corwin’s trembling fingers, cracked chase heart, and ink-soaked skin give embodied motive; the bottled whisper and frost grammar anchor his contradictory drive to rupture yet preserve. Interiority is concrete—“letters kept falling out of order”—but the mirror-keeper’s warning stays ornamental, never forcing a micro-choice. The final step onto cloud is earned: he pays with the orchard folding into a heartbeat glyph, renouncing safe ground. Still, the keeper remains off-stage, so status dynamics are absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard collapses into a private glyph, compressing eternity with visible cost—Corwin’s library and identity gone. Causal chain holds: frost code → types sentence → rupture → library folds. Orientation is swift; “glass orchard library drifted above the cloud-sea” anchors by line 2. One minor drift: the mirror-keeper’s warning is told, not dramatized, but it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The glass orchard, cloud-sea, and steel orchid letterpress are vivid, selective, and pressure-driven; glass fruit cracking into ticking numerals directly alters stakes. Frost patterns on panes act as micro-setting that guides Corwin’s decoding and later spiral invitation. Spatial choreography is clean: prow → press → tilting deck → broken pane → cloud path. No sensory overload; each detail constrains or enables the rupture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is signaled early and tightened when the printed sentence destabilizes the library. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: glass apples crack, pears melt, deck lists, navigation orrery warps, each beat reweighting the cost. Agency is Corwin’s at every turn: he reads frost, sets type, uncorks whisper, steps onto cloud. The price—loss of the orchard and anchor to reality—is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of negotiated reality emerges through action, not statement: the orchard’s collapse and Corwin’s inhalation of frost alphabets embody the cost of compressing eternity. Subtext resides in the spiral frost that “pointed nowhere and everywhere,” inviting without declaring. Final image—the private heartbeat glyph—reweights all prior glass and cloud imagery without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “chiming softly as they ripen with stories,” “steel orchid at the library’s heart.” POV stays locked to Corwin; no head-hop. Compression like “cloud-sea” and “frost teeth” is taught early and paid off. Syntax mirrors pressure—short clauses at rupture, longer sinuous ones while decoding frost. Distinct perceptual signature: a letterpress operator who sees grammar in frost and hears fruit ripen into narrative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—“glass apples cracked, revealing seeds of ticking numerals”—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; “he inhaled the spiral frost-pattern” compresses breath and alphabet in one motion. Minor elevated diction (“negotiable sky”) is consistent with the reality-bent frame. Final line lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The floating glass orchard library, bottled whisper, and frost grammar synthesize into a singular vision that feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails if any element is swapped; the orchard’s collapse into a heartbeat glyph is non-obvious and earned. Risk is high—rupturing reality itself—but executed with conceptual rigor. No close echoes; the image set is original and indelible.</comment>
