<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quince’s contradictory impulses—his need to quantify grief versus the unquantifiable cost of empathy—are dramatized in the press reversal; the final self-printing is earned by the erosion of every borrowed soul, leaving a visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Quince reverses the press, scattering borrowed personalities and rekindling stars; the causal lens holds because each borrowed life is shown subtracting from his own until only the blank self remains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The topaz dome, halo fragment, and letterpress are not mere scenery; they constrain tactics—the dome admits starlight needed for the halo’s glow, the press’s flywheel becomes a heartbeat, and the fragment’s final crack stitches new constellations that charge the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how much of himself Quince will forfeit to understand emotion—tightens when the halo child reveals the remainder he never accounted for; the reversal of the press is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses borrowing forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specific mechanism of empathy-as-subtraction; the final sky teaches that “to shine is to be alone together” without moralizing, reweighting every prior borrowed grief into a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, and consistent; the operator’s perceptual signature filters every image through print metaphors (“wet newsprint,” “loosened plates”) and the rhythmic control never falters under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and information-dense; figurative language is disciplined, with no loops or mixed metaphors, and the final cadence—“perfectly weightless and suddenly terrifying”—lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of empathy-as-letterpress is a fresh synthesis; the risk of reversing the press to scatter souls feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story commits fully to its metaphysical premise without gimmickry.</comment>
