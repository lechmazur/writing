<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Quince’s choice to print himself back into singularity is rooted in the escalating loss of self that the borrowed widow-astronomer-grief sequence dramatizes. Interiority is specific and embodied (“her grief clung… like wet newsprint”), and the final endurance—walking away blank but intact—earns its cost because the causality of personality-drain has been shown. The single on-page weakness is slight diagnostic drift around “to understand the mathematics of emotion,” but it is offset by the visceral stakes inside the press-breath moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration under Accumulative lens: every borrowed soul returned and every star rekindled reweights the central empathy premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Orientation is adequate (topaz cliff, night, present), and causality holds until the final image. One mild telegraph—the decision to reverse the press—arrives with less immediate setup than ideal, preventing the higher 8+ tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Topaz dome, cliff workshop, and halo fragment constrain choices and reappear at closure, satisfying the gate. Sensory specificity (“moon-silver ink,” “spectral tears”) is selective and pressure-shaped. Micro-setting (press, plate, balcony rail) acts as bodily limits. Spatial tracking remains coherent even across the workshop doubling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake—loss of self versus need to feel others—ramps coherently as each borrowed identity erodes Quince’s own lattice. A visible tightening occurs when he sees the child-of-light and recognizes subtraction equals annihilation until he chooses reversal. Cost (blank self) is felt on the final line. One small escalatory jump happens slightly off-page during the backward run, keeping it just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of relinquishing borrowed selves as the only way to retain authentic empathy emerges organically through concrete acts—feeding negatives into the press, rekindling stars. Ambiguity lingers without moralizing; the silence after Quince locks the dome invites reader reweighting. Final image refracts the entire arc without declaring the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No head-hopping; POV remains securely anchored to Quince with patterned lyric compression taught from line 1. Diction and rhythm alter under pressure—longer hypotactic runs when numbers flood in, clipped fragments as he decides. Voice maintains perceptual signature even in shared-child speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Few scaffold phrases; lines are densely freighted (“eigenvalues of sorrow, vectors of longing”). One mixed metaphor—“ink flowed uphill”—clears emotional logic without breaking clarity. Rhythm rises and falls with action beats (“pulsed like a question,” “gears clicking out half-truths”). No pervasive loops dilute the closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Letterpress-as-empathy-press is a bold, non-generic premise. The star-gathering into a child of light re-configures the borrowed-self trope into something inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of materials—cedar drawer, topaz dome, leaden fractions—grounds the concept. The final constellation of emotional glyphs is fresh and fully earned.</comment>
