<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her “trembling calm” recurs and deepens. Micro-choices (rotating the screw, pocketing it) trace motive to cost. The shift from regaining smell to midwifing stories is earned via tactile epiphany. Only a hairline slip: the final pocketing feels slightly neat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: loss of smell → translating leaks → discovering the screw’s story → reassembling with quarter-turn. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s first drop becomes a newborn gasp, reweighting time and loss. Cost is felt in Mira’s tear-blurred loupe and her silence to Horace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The water-clock shop, fog, and screw-as-micro-setting constrain every move. Fog presses like a diaphragm; the screw’s warmth and micro-scratches anchor sensory translation. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Could edge higher if the shop itself altered tactics more overtly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mira midwife meaning without smell? Pressure tightens when the screw’s story surfaces, forcing her to renounce odor-recovery and embrace narrative midwifery. The quarter-turn is a visible, irreversible choice. Cost is emotional and professional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: meaning is midwifed through loss, not despite it. The screw’s journey from tool to prayer to keepsake reconfigures value without moralizing. Final image of the city inhaling offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in silence between Mira and Horace is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—fingertip cartography, scent-memory synesthesia. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses for reflection, staccato drops for climax. No head-hopping; Horace’s mutter is filtered through Mira’s attention. Voice is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture and advance. Metaphors (clock as diaphragm, screw as spindle) are precise and non-contradictory. Minor loop risk in “trembling calm” repetition, but it functions as motif. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: aromatherapist-turned-tactile-translator, water-clock as obstetric timepiece. Screw-as-relic trope is transformed into a metallic prayer. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final gasp-drop. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
