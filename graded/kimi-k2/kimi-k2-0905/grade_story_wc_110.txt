<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s refusal to accuse anyone and her final renunciation (“I’m letting both go”) are earned by the scavenger-hunt reveal; the micro-choice to thread the archival reel shows embodied values. Interiority stays concrete (“pulse stumbled,” “heart drumming”) without label-speak. The open-lock doodle externalizes her cost: she forfeits moral certainty to thaw collective mistrust. Status shift with Rico/Jun is legible in their shining eyes and floor-sweeping solidarity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: doodles → eavesdrop → lens discovery → public screening each tighten options because Mira could expose the prank yet chooses absolution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she locks the gate having paid the price of surrendering righteous anger. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“crystal whispering forecourt after rain”). Only nit: cash-theft backstory is recalled, not re-shown, but it motivates present choice without breaking chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wet-stone forecourt, missing lens, and archival reel are not backdrop; each is handled, hidden, or re-mounted to alter next moves. Rain-threaded crystal pillars mirror the washed-clean resolution without overt symbolism. Projector booth dust “like plankton” is selective, tactile, POV-filtered. Spatial track is clean: grate → booth → exit sign → forecourt projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clear the staff of theft—tightens when Mira realizes the lens was a prank gone toxic; her choice to screen the memories forecloses revenge and risks looking complicit. Cost is visible: she shoulders the “ambiguously clear weight of trust,” surrendering the safety of blame. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—secrecy imprisons, honesty liberates—emerges through the reel’s silent apology rather than assertion. The open-lock doodle reweights the earlier sewn-shut mouth, letting theme resonate without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: sweeping together replaces speaking. Complexity remains: trust is a “cloak that fit at last,” implying future fragility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mira’s perceptual quirks (“listening to snow fall upward”). Syntax lengthens under stress then clips at climax (“I’m letting both go”). No head-hopping; Rico/Jun’s dialogue is filtered through grate-eavesdrop, preserving distance. Distinctive diction throughout—“crystal whispering,” “resonant hush”—yet never purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is spare and precise—one metaphor per beat, never stacked. Information density high: “dust floated like plankton” does setting + atmosphere + lens absence in one stroke. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; final line (“cloak that fit at last”) lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Workplace prank turned moral crucible feels fresh; the archival “Staff Memories” reel as collective confession is a lovely, specific invention. Not a crime-reveal but a trust-repair plot, avoiding noir tropes. Risk taken with near-lyric causality pays off. Could swap names yet the projector-lens mechanics and after-hours concert-hall ritual are irreducibly particular.</comment>
