<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“pulse stumbled,” “heart drumming”), but the decisive renunciation (“I’m letting both go”) arrives with minimal dramatized cost; the forgiveness feels pre-cooked rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s choice to screen the reel reconfigures the social field and carries felt cost in the open-lock doodle. Causal chain holds—ticket → lens → reel → reconciliation—though the scavenger-hunt reveal is slightly contrived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt’s wet marble and obsolete projector create tactile pressure; the lens-as-setting constrains the final act of projection. Selective sensory detail (“dust floated like plankton”) is purposeful, but the space could have pushed choices harder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—is signaled early and tightened once when Mira overhears the plot. Agency is present but low-stakes; the cost is relational rather than visceral, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of secrecy vs. honesty emerges organically through objects and silence; the open-lock doodle offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in the archival reel carries the apology better than dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“quiet night registrar,” “resonant hush”—and rhythmic control under pressure. Compression is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor loops (“resonant hush” twice) and one mixed metaphor (“snow fall upward”). No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The scavenger-hunt absolution feels fresh within the workplace-microscope frame; the archival reel as silent apology is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is moderate, not bold.</comment>
