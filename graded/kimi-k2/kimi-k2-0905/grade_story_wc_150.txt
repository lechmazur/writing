<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Multi-layered protagonist whose exile and return drive every beat; contradictions (faith/doubt, belonging/exile) are dramatized through concrete choices like aligning the sundial on bones. Earned refusal—she stays—forecloses exile with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mosaic track (two shards: orchard excavation & root-road ritual) taught early; closure holds the dominant lens (situational pressure crystallizing belief). Orientation anchored within 120 words; reliquary mirrors create Decisive Change for diaspora closure.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Setting is embodied tool: root ceilings, fossil petals, and orchard gates that literally pressurize choices. Geographic specificity (catacomb orchard) constrains tactics—roots force route, provide living mortar for prayer house rebirth.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: rebuild faith or remain exiled. Tightens as sundial’s shadow shortens; ancestral suspension pays off as root-arches point to burned prayer house, narrowing options from excavating to praying. Conceptual Repricing in dawn’s rebuilding.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through bones vs. blossoms: restoring ritual life from colonial death. Final non-literal answer—shadow on ruins resurrects beams—rewrites premise without preaching. Warmly curious stance toward ancestors charges the catacomb hymn.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice balances compression with rhythmic incantation (“wind invented hymn”). Pattern-taught non-linear cadence sustained; interior/lyric blend tightens under pressure. No head-hopping; entire piece reads via returnee’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dense, musical prose drives momentum yet avoids ornament; fossil petals, brass mirrors, myrrh air filter POV without purple flourish. No loops; every sentence advances image or choice. Final Charged Poise image earns cost.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mythic bones-as-roots synthesis feels inevitable; catacomb orchard as both tomb and birthplace transcends familiar diaspora tropes. Sundial base reprises as bell-tower gnomon—indispensable, not swappable. Risk pays off roots singing “hymn by wind.”</comment>
