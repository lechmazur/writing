<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his helpless foresight and active surrender charges the final beat. The sister’s death and promise anchor motive, but her absence keeps relationship pressure abstract. The moment he touches the dissolving eel crystallizes cost, yet the prior beats lean more on lyric than on micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the promise is fulfilled by relinquishing understanding itself, with the star-dust constellation making the cost legible. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each rock placement tightens the pattern until the reweighting erupts. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens drift. One shard, one transition, one deepening—meets scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, painted rocks, and star-dust pouch function as micro-settings that constrain placement and rhythm. Aurora and frictionless physics are learned through action, not exposition. The final constellation re-uses these elements to charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise to Mira—tightens when Elias realizes the only way to keep it is to stop trying to understand. The mathematical sequence is the single escalating action that forecloses explanation and forces surrender. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the eel and the lifting of the curse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: surrender to pattern versus mastery of it. Mira’s dying sentence (“patterns aren’t in the rocks…”) reweights at the end without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence after the star-dust song and in the empty pouch—resonant, unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through Elias’s synesthetic foresight. Syntax modulates with pressure—short declaratives at the touch, longer coils during pattern-building. No head-hopping; distance remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, but every figurative layer serves pattern or pressure; no loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates into the final chord. Occasional elevated diction (“sacred geometries,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frictionless world, eel-herding vocation, and star-dust promise synthesize into a fresh cosmology. The inversion—understanding achieved only by abandoning the quest—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final constellation image.</comment>
