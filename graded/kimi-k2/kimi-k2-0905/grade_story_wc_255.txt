<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Milo’s color-blind yearning is vivid and embodied; his trembling fingers, tobacco stains, and final refusal to paint again show a credible arc. The interior contradiction—hunger for color yet terror at its violence—drives every beat. Rosa’s “innocently cunning” smile is the only label not fully dramatized; the rest of her pressure arrives through glass and salt. Cost is legible: he trades away the eye that let him see, accepting permanent fracture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Milo renounces painting, the marble eye is returned, the spiral garden remains broken—cost is on the page. Accumulative lens holds: each dawn’s rearrangement thickens pattern until the cracked reed and shattered glass crystallize the stake. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One soft spot: the reed’s shift from song to rasp is reported rather than shown, blunting the final causal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard’s glass dust, salt circles, and kiln heat constrain every choice; even the marble eye functions as micro-setting pressed to Milo’s socket. Selective sensory hierarchy—heat-scarred hands, ultraviolet ash—mirrors Milo’s synesthetic panic. Spatial choreography is clean: reed moves from Rosa’s ear to pot to spiral without drift. Environment directly charges the final image: shards and ash become the colored rain that will blind future painters.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—see color or accept fracture—tightens when the eye’s gift reveals violent hues Milo cannot bear. Agency is present: he chooses to smash the vases he helped create, foreclosing the path of pristine beauty. Pressure escalates under accumulative lens; each dawn’s plant reply raises the cost of misunderstanding. The final renunciation carries visible price: he buries the reed and never paints again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: beauty is the crack that sings. The reed’s devolution from silver song to rasping wheeze reweights the premise—imperfection is the only voice left. No moralizing; the colored rain image lets future painters inherit Milo’s fracture. Subtext in Rosa’s hidden smile and salt circle keeps ambiguity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Milo’s color-blind perception; perceptual signature is consistent—he “bleeds copper and teal” where skin is scarred. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: long sentences for dawn rituals, clipped fragments for the smash. No head-hopping; Rosa’s interior is accessed only through gesture and steam-fogged goggles. Reed’s voice shift is the single line where diction drifts toward editorial summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without scaffold. “Glass-blown leaves that had cooled into permanent autumn” compresses craft, mortality, and setting in one stroke. No loops or synonym churn; each shard, stem, and salt grain recurs with new weight. Only nit: “innocently cunning smile” is a near-paradox cliché amid otherwise fresh phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of color-blind painter, phoenix ash, and bartered awakenings feels inevitable yet unseen before. The reed-as-voice and plant-arrangement language are specific inventions; swap any part and the story collapses. Risk—renouncing the very gift the quest secured—pays off in earned stasis. Fresh inflection: beauty is the fracture that keeps singing.</comment>
