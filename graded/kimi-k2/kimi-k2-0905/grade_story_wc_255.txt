<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Milo’s colorblindness and longing for unseen hues are embodied in tactile searching and trembling hands; the marble eye’s gift forces a visible cost—fractured, violent color that redefines his art. Rosa’s “innocently cunning” smile and reed-behind-ear gesture show status shift and mutual awakening. Final renunciation of painting for living arrangements earns closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Milo abandons painting yet gains vision, Rosa keeps the reed’s song; both pay with permanence of fracture. Causal chain—reed trade → eye vision → collaborative destruction → planted reed—tightens under Accumulative/Textural lens; final spiral garden crystallizes before/after. Cost is legible in “we are most alive where we are broken.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glassblower’s courtyard anchors early with kiln steam, ash, and discarded plants; micro-setting of marble-eye POV warps light into bruised rainbows that constrain Milo’s next action. Spiral of smashed glass and dying flora charges final image. Spatial choreography clean across four days of rearrangement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding beauty in imperfection—escalates via bartered awakenings and plant-dialogue; each dawn’s rearrangement tightens pressure. Agency: Milo chooses to smash vases and plant reed, paying with permanent shift from painter to arranger. Cost visible in “never painted again.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from cracked glass and fractured color: beauty lives in damage, not repair. Subtext in plant grammar and reed’s rasping wheeze avoids moralizing. Final image of morning glories threading the reed offers resonant non-literal answer without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, textured voice sustains perceptual signature—Milo’s colorless world rendered in tactile ash and tobacco stains; Rosa’s steam-rough voice distinct. Compression taught early (“bartered awakenings”) and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stable within each segment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propels with rhythmic variation and high density—“ash cooling to ash,” “colors screaming like discordant notes.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language purposeful. Final line “colors that exist only in the cracks” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind painter taught by fractured glass and reed song; phoenix ash as distributed pigment rain. Risky choice to end with renunciation rather than triumph deepens stakes. Specificity of plant grammar and marble-eye vision feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
