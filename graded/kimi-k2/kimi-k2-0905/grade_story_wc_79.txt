<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied ("ink-stained thumb," "pulse hammered against her coral collar"), motives escalate from curiosity to irreversible choice; final renunciation carries visible cost as she drops the whistle and accepts exile from the known map.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: tremor → pattern match → altered whistle note → watchers respond → crack reveals mother → city turns back. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: gate closed to protect, not punish, with felt cost in the new chart she must now draw.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shell-city, desert horizon, oxidized watchers—each constrains action and charges the final image; the spiral-grooved watcher faces mirror her atlas, making the setting an active antagonist rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city’s survival versus personal need for truth—tightens once when the whistle’s cracked note forces the turtles north; cost is legible in merchants’ screams and her dropped whistle, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: maps are acts of love and betrayal; the final image of “families waiting on the other side of silence” reweights every prior note without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic, tidal, precise—“sunwashed dread,” “sound frayed into harmonics that tasted of iron”—with perceptual signature of a cartographer who hears geography; no head-hopping, compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphor serves pressure (“tremor travel up her spine like a warning spelled in Morse”) without overwriting. One minor loop: “sunwashed dread” appears twice; otherwise zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Shell-cities, pattern-language cartography, archived watchers—elements synthesize into a singular vision; the crack as living geode feels inevitable yet unforeseen, transforming familiar quest motifs into something uncanny and new.</comment>
