<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“face rinsed by needle-cold droplets”) and her silent recitation contradicts the drone gaze; her final renunciation costs the years already lost, earned because the reader feels it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The causal arc is lean: steal manuscript → dissolve into silver halide → transmit through storm → vanish; each step tightens options and the timer’s final second held forever is the earned Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory’s iron mount and reversed waterfalls literally press against her body; the stormlit cloudbank doubles as developing tray and escape route, charging the final image of upward signal launch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the verses alive vs. erasure—escalates when the lightning flash overexposes the second sheet, turning a setback into a tactical pivot; agency holds through to the broadcast solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Survival of erased voices emerges through concrete action (disintegrating paper into “ghost moon”) and ends in a non-literal answer that lets the sky remember; theme is lived, never asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Refracted-light prose mirrors storm glare, controlled compression from “censored poet Mara” to “until the metal of the world remembers its own music”; every image is filtered through Mara's peril and wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level propulsion is near flawless; only a few stacked metaphors in the thunder-lit “secret ocean” approach overwriting yet still advance the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—censorship, clandestine transmission—are transmuted into a luminous negative-space broadcast; the storm observatory as darkroom is an organic, irreplaceable synthesis.</comment>
