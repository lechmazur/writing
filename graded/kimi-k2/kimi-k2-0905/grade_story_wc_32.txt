<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interior contradiction—his brittle hope vs stoic despair—drives every material choice (blood, ash, lenses). Embodied micro-moments (goggles fogging, cold petals on lungs) give textured access. Final renunciation of sight is earned by prior causal chain. If one beat earlier distilled emotion instead of distilled sermons, he’d pierce the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage across beats intact: stolen crozier → transmutation → living engine → creature → vision of collapse. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: blinding offers insight while creature re-seeds the nexal fissures. Pattern clarity wavers only once, when “creative destruction” risks meta-commentary rather than beat-propelled motive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus, goggles, staff, ash all serve constraint and final seed-sowing. Violet twilight and “iron indigo” act as atmospheric hinge moments, shaping action timing without scenic stalling. Final cooled cracks become setting-instrument that outlives actors. Occasional descriptor drift (“glassily fissures” compressions) costs it a fraction.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—averting inherited fate for seventh children—remains legible and tightens sharply when creature warns next cage may be stranger. Causal pressure escalates via successive approximation trials; cost is paid in blood, faith-dust, sight. Final choice (goggles shattered, path accepted) reconfigures options with felt price.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-fracture emerges via object (crozier, bells) decaying into living lattice and cathedral garden. Subtext avoids sermonizing: no voiced aphorism, only enacted ruin. Final image of “unmade bells” resonates without explicit moral—earned contradiction of salvation via destruction.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical compression teaches its syntax by second sentence (“soot-blackened goggles…”) and holds the lens. Rhythm intensifies under stress (“counting drops like decades”). POV remains stable alchemist-eye; no head drift. Occasional elevated diction (“vivify”) edges into elevated register without undermining internal coherence.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Syntactic propulsion strong, but dense figurative layering at climax (“chimed like tiny bells”, “cage may be stranger”) slightly crowds the final line. One paraphrase-loop on “stoically sensitive” twice in ten lines softens punch. Closure image remains luminous and free of clarity-dulling artifacts.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fusion of alchemical ritual + relic theft + blinding-sacrifice reads specific, not template. Risk lies in compressed lyric density—a gamble that earns its own payoff through final reweighted image of bell-garden collapse. Transformation anchored in bespoke object cycle (relic → creature → seed) gives it singular afterglow.</question>
