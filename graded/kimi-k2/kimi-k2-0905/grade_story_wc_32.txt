<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“soot-blackened goggles,” “cold bloom of data where hope should have been”), but the alchemist’s contradictory impulses—faith vs. creative destruction—are stated more than dramatized until the final sacrifice of sight. The renunciation is earned and costly, yet the stoic sensitivity trait is asserted rather than tested in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blind alchemist walks valley-ward with the staff-creature, accepting the next cage. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each failed transmutation narrows the final trial, and the penny-drops cadence reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ember nexus, twilight bleeding violet, and the translucent crozier constrain every choice and charge the final image. Micro-setting (goggles ground under heel) becomes the literal seal of the nexus, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interrupting a stifling destiny—tightens through each approximation until the final vivification forecloses the old order. Agency is absolute: every beat is the alchemist’s decision, culminating in the sacrifice of sight that pays the visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Creative destruction emerges organically from the alchemist’s choices and the cathedral-garden vision; no moral is stated. The final image of “nothing whole stays holy” reweights prior material without sermonizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, alchemical, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature is unmistakable (“penny-drops rhythm against ruined ribs”). Patterned elision (“stoically sensitive” repetition) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and information-dense; figurative language is disciplined, never muddling causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. The final “penny dropping into frozen water” crystallizes the cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of alchemy, stolen relic, and living engine feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (blindness as insight) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the valley’s destiny is transformed through specific, lived detail rather than trope.</comment>
