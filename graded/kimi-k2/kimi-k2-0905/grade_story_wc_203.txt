<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s technician mindset and ghost-seer burden collide in embodied micro-choices—prying the vent, gauging spring tension—each action revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The final renunciation (leaving the spring half-wound) costs her the fantasy of full absolution, earned by prior causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, ghost arrivals, and clock gears accrue density until the half-wound spring reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mara accepts perpetual custodianship with the mainspring ticking against her hip. Cost is legible in the transferred “weightless burden.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ticket office, cupola, and elevator tool-kit are rendered through tactile specificity; each spatial zone constrains movement and supplies resources (vent grille, iron ladder, brass barrel). The broken stained-glass moonlight pools on gears “tall as tombstones,” charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the mainspring while appeasing ghosts—tightens via escalating sensory density and spectral demands. One decisive turn: Mara chooses partial release, not full exorcism, narrowing her future to endless repair cycles. Cost is visible in the transferred burden and the silence “heavier than before.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship versus closure emerges from concrete particulars: dust spirals, half-wound spring, ticking satchel. No moralizing; the final image reweights the premise—ghosts become elevator cargo—without explicit statement. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is technician-precise yet haunted: “elevator repair technician and unwilling ghost-seer” establishes idiom; perceptual signature notices counterweights and dust stripes. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under spectral rush, longer coils during spring work. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Mara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free. Figurative language (“moonlight dripped,” “metallic perfume”) is selective and purposeful. No scaffold or synonym churn; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Clean mechanics and vivid specificity throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech + ghost medium + horological circus ruins. Tropes are transformed through occupational specificity and inverted gravity (confetti raining upward). Risky structure—single-scene accumulative lyric—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
