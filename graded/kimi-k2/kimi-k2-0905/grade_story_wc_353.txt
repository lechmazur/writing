<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilay’s motivation (“to create music in a silent world”) is explicit yet embodied through tactile micro-choices—mapping cracks, matching heartbeats, strumming fissures. The interior contradiction (urgency vs. arboreal patience) plays out in scene, and the final bow signals earned renunciation with visible cost (trembling knees). No secondary character pressure, but single-POV depth suffices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s “almost-audible mercy” crystallizes the new acoustic covenant. Causal chain (crack-mapping → strumming → statue exhales → valley re-strings) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the stored anthem and Ilay’s tremor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The alder grove is not backdrop but instrument: resin scent, moss color-shift, and fungal listening constrain tactics. Micro-setting (porcelain insulator as robin’s-egg battery) charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no weather clichés. Environment actively shapes the climax—grove “joins” the symphony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore song before silence calcifies—tightens via each strum that widens cracks and risks the statue’s fracture. One meaningful deepening: the statue’s mouth opens, releasing sorrow-as-comfort. Agency drives escalation; luck absent. Cost visible in micro-widened fissures and stored glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between silence as forgetting and empathy as audible repair. Subtext in the hedgehog’s second uncurling and the siskin-shaped crack. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing: mercy becomes audible but not yet spoken. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“hush of needles,” “winter-cold”—with rhythmic control that breathes with arboreal tempo. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact. Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic pitch-mapping. Elisions (e.g., 17 silent years) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and causal work. Metaphors (glass nests, startled deer) are coherent and purposeful. High information density without purple drift. Final arpeggio line propels closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—sculptor tuning a lightning-scarred statue to resurrect valley song—is non-obvious yet inevitable. Fresh synthesis of arboriculture, obsolete tech, and empathic acoustics. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (reclaimed copper strings, goose-feather plectrum) anchors universals.</comment>
