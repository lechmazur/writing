<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leo’s fear/identity contradiction is embodied in every beat; the trembling take becomes the earned spine. Interiority stays tactile—knees knocking, shell cupped to ear—never label-speak. The final choice to leak the reel crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible social cost. Micro-choice hierarchy (fear vs legacy) is legible and paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: DNA test → shell hunt → guards → leak. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he forecloses the old stunt-identity by projecting the trembling take, cost legible in “bruised body double brand retired.” Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening when the shell’s whisper re-weights tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rusted library’s iron shelves and perforated roof constrain movement and supply the projector; stars become unpaid extras in the final image. Micro-setting (shell cupped to ear) functions as charged object-as-setting. Sensory selection narrows to heartbeat counts and metallic creaks under fear. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove vulnerability is power—tightens when heirs threaten digital erasure. Escalation driven by protagonist agency: decrypt cast → retrieve shell → choose projection over escape. Cost visible in social forfeiture of branded identity. No coincidence resolves; guards complicate, not save.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific stunt-world particulars: edited frames, raw rehearsal footage, studio tyranny. Final image—stars spilling through roof while trembling take plays—reweights “weakness” as power without moralizing. Subtext in shell’s whisper and winged-lion sticker. Resonant ambiguity lingers: audiences may love or revile the shake.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>First-person voice distinct: stunt jargon, camera metaphors, tactile fear. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“three… two… one—”. No head-hopping; girl’s dialogue minimal, subtextual. Filter verbs used sparingly and voice-motivated. Syntax mirrors phobia—short, staccato beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: “rusted library groaned like an old prop ship” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor register drift—“conceptual betrayal” edges academic—but contained. Final line lands clean: “lights that would never again drown the shake.”</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt double phobia + studio tyranny + whispering shell. Shell-as-legacy device transformed from cliché into instruction to keep the trembling take. Risk-taking in projecting raw fear as climax pays off. No derivative premise; lived Hollywood detail grounds the twist.</comment>
