<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied ("felt thought bloom inside my mineral skull like warm ink"), but the statue’s final choice to break the ampoule is more asserted than earned; no prior beat shows internal conflict crystallizing into this specific act. The gardener’s presence is braided rather than dramatized, so the statue’s motivation feels second-hand. Still, the softening of stone into “possibility” is a credible change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ampoule’s release reweights the entire drowned garden from museum to living dialogue. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each footfall triggers micro-awakenings that build to the decisive seep of memory. The cost is palpable in the city’s shiver and the statue’s loss of calcified certainty. No orientation drift; spatial anchors are clear from the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foxglove-stained ampoule and keystone arch are not mere scenery; they physically constrain the final choice and charge the closing image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“moonlight arrived only as a bruised glow”). The underwater garden’s pressure—salt, silt, eroded mortar—directly shapes tactics. Environment, tool, and body converge to make the closure inevitable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve the city’s certainties or release nuanced memory—is signaled early and tightened through each micro-awakening. The decisive act of cracking the ampoule narrows options irreversibly. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the statue’s own stone identity. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the danger of certainties and the mercy of ambiguity. Subtext is carried by image—the foxglove’s shared roots of poison and remedy—rather than statement. Final image of “slow corals of ambiguity” offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature unique to mineral sentience (“taste the grief of barnacles”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences glide, then tighten at the arch. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the statue. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, theme, and forward motion. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent (“stone robes shedding flakes of calcified certainty”). No loops or scaffold; high information density without clutter. Rhythm accelerates toward the decisive crack, then exhales into the final garden image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—a telepathic statue midwifes a drowned city’s rebirth—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes (living statue, memory vial) are transformed through specific, embodied stakes. The synthesis of classical statuary, marine biology, and ethical nuance is non-obvious and risk-taking. Final reconfiguration is earned, not gimmicky.</comment>
