<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s quietly-compassionate broker is vivid via micro-choices (waiving fees, drafting NGO receipt); interiority stays concrete, contradiction shown in her need to stay anonymous. Relationship with Beto supplies secondary pressure and status shift. Final renunciation of the locket carries visible cost, earning closure under Accumulative lens. Voice remains distinct, though one beat of “therapy-speak” interiority (−0.3) keeps this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers the covert kindness ledger until the envelope delivery crystallizes it. Causality intact—no teleporting props; orientation anchored by word 60. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the empty sleeve + lantern sweep reweight the cycle with undeniable conceptual cost. Persistent constraint (locket gone) shapes future tactics; no ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt-wind library, reflective-patched coat, and battery lantern are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly enable or mirror choices. The wharf’s dereliction and NGO pennant ground stakes. Micro-setting (locket photo) recharges final image. One minor spatial blur during seawall walk (−0.1) is all that keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silent compassion must stay hidden yet keep circulating—tightens when the mis-delivered envelope forces public agency. Marisol’s decision to log funds legally and surrender the locket forecloses anonymity; price is legible. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, fitting Accumulative lens. Coincidence (Beto’s nephew link) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical kindness emerges through concrete logistics: fee waivers → envelope → NGO stipend → locket freight change. Final image of dawn crates bearing “invisible thanks” reweights prior beats without moralizing. Subtext in Beto’s off-key humming and lantern sweep carries more meaning than dialogue. No thematic echo penalties; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Marisol; perceptual signature salted with cargo argot (“demurrage,” “manifest”) and tidal metaphors. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for library hush, clipped fragments at wharf. Free indirect clean; no head-hop. One register spike (“conceptual repricing”) in closing line (−0.2) prevents 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, scaffold-free; figurative language purposeful (“lantern…like a conductor’s baton”). No mixed metaphors, no loops. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance. One passive construction allowed for voice. Clean copy, high information yield; earns 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Combines maritime logistics, starlit library, and covert charity into a fresh configuration; the kindness-ledger-as-cargo concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in quiet Accumulative structure pays off. Not quite groundbreaking enough for 9+ band, but memorable and specific.</comment>
