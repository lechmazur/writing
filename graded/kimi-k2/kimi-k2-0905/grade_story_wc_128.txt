<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s quiet waivers and the locket photo anchor her interiority; the causal link between her mother’s past rescue and tonight’s choice is clear, though the final hand-off of the locket feels slightly external to her immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The envelope’s mis-delivery triggers a clean, escalating chain: library → Tío Beto → Wharf of Lanterns → NGO; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marisol logs the night’s work as “miscellaneous inbound—value immeasurable,” crystallizing the cost of her hidden kindness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt wind flapping card-catalog drawers, starlight scattered by Beto’s reflective coat—details are selective, sensory, and tied to choice; the wharf’s dereliction and lantern beam serve as final image that reweights the theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent compassion versus exposure—tightens when the envelope forces Marisol to act in person; the cost is the perpetual need to hide her generosity, felt in the locket’s transfer and the logged “immeasurable” value.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical kindness emerges through concrete events (mother’s rescue, tonight’s waiver, envelope delivery) without sermon; the final image of trucks carrying “invisible thanks” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marisol’s perceptual signature; lyric compression (“salt wind flapped the card catalog drawers like gull wings”) is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid—each sentence advances character, setting, or theme; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; final cadence “ready to initiate another quiet waiver” lands with earned poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “hidden benefactor” trope is refreshed by maritime logistics, NGO relief, and the locket’s cyclical freight; the coincidence of Beto recognizing the photo is justified by the story’s own rule of returning tides.</comment>
