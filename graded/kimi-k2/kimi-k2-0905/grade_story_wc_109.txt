<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is vivid—her childhood pebble-collecting anchors motive, her body registers cold, her micro-choice to “step into her own outline” crystallizes the arc. Mild obsession is shown via compulsive cartography, not label. Cost is legible: she fossilizes while breathing, surrenders to absence. Yet the absence of on-stage opposition keeps the crucible purely internal; still, the self-imposed stakes feel sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map glows in absolute dark, the fort dissolves, oracle becomes first coordinate—undeniable before/after with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each symbol thickens the hush until the final dark pour reweights everything. Orientation is taught lyrically by line 5; waiver applies. No causality breaks; the star’s extinction seals the map, fulfilling the hinge premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ridge-fort stones groan under her feet, salt-iron wind carries taste, blank booklet pages shed glitter—details are tactile, selective, POV-filtered. The “borderless smudge” that bleeds onto her wrist charges the final image, constraining her next action. Spatial choreography stays clean across parapet, stairwell, crenels. Environment actively teaches her how to fossilize, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the map before the last star dies—is signaled early and tightens with each symbol drawn. Agency is present: she writes faster, trades motion for stillness, seals the threshold. The star’s wink-out forecloses all light, a felt price that reweights the hush she catalogued. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cartography of absence as act of love/creation. Final image—oracle becomes first coordinate—reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Recurring pebble-eye memory and reversed embers echo with shifted weight. Subtext in “Here exits what was never entrance” invites multiple readings yet lands coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is irreducibly lyric: “ambered hush,” “latitude of last lullaby,” mineral patience—diction stays within oracle’s mystical lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into the final stroke, then cuts to stillness, mirroring star-death. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“summarizing silence into ink that would not dry”) and paid off. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors are extravagant yet internally coherent—no mixed vehicles. Information density high: one line can layer sensory, symbolic, and causal work. A single paraphrase loop (“opening onto the same door opening onto the same door”) is purposeful recursion, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: star-extinction as cartographic deadline, silence mined for ink, oracle self-maps into void. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in glowing map that survives apocalypse. Concept commits fully; no retreat to conventional plot. Specificity of pebble-eyes, reversed embers, and graphite shimmer prevents abstraction drift. Feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
