<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her soles gripping wet stone, the booklet’s salt-swollen pages against her chest. Motivation (map the night) is consistent and intensifies under pressure, culminating in the costly act of transposing the fort into the booklet. Mild obsession deepens into hunger, driving micro-choices (faster quill, refusal to let guard interrupt). Final renunciation—remaining alone inside the booklet—earns its cost through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fort collapses into the booklet, leaving only smooth rock outside. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each summarized silence adds a line to the map, density increasing until space itself is peeled away. Cost is legible on the final page: “the ambered hush lifted like a curtain, and sudden wind roared through the fort, carrying away every sleeping soldier’s name.” No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort, flaking gold-leaf booklet, and suspended star are rendered with tactile specificity. The booklet evolves from artifact to portal, constraining the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—wind claws, flag snaps, salt flakes drift—mirroring the oracle’s narrowed focus. Final image of “smooth rock” recharges the vanished fort, making absence legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the endless night so others may navigate—tightens as each silence is inked. Escalation is accumulative: every line drawn shrinks the fort, increases urgency, and forecloses the option of staying in the world. Cost is visible when the soldiers’ names are carried away and the oracle is left alone inside the booklet. Agency is sustained; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the act of summarizing silence: stewardship of absence. Subtext operates in the hush that muffles even the snapping flag. Final image of the afterimage lingering on gold leaf offers a non-literal answer—memory as a navigable shore. No moralizing; resonance arises from the oracle’s embodied labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “salt and years of whispered questions,” “fossilized honey.” Perceptual signature is selective—oracle notices flakes of gold, the last star’s suspended tear. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the oracle’s whisper to the booklet carries subtext of finality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “stones pulling inward as though space itself were being peeled away.” No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are precise and coherent—“ambered hush,” “marbled tenderness.” Rhythm modulates with urgency: longer cadences for reflection, staccato for the final inscription.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: siege retold as cartography of silence, fort transposed into booklet. Transformation test—plot could not survive name or place swap. Specificity anchors universals: salt-stained pages, suspended star. Risk-taking (collapsing physical world into text) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
