<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“soft mechanical tick inside my ribs”), contradictions live in scene (“refusal…to let the count reach zero”), and the final renunciation (leaving the clerk, stepping into the ring) is earned by prior micro-choices. The heartbeat count functions as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics. Minor slip: the clerk’s interiority is ventriloquised rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist slices the digital film, re-entering flesh while accepting the cost of living on a typo. Causal chain (error → ghost → ink map → re-embodiment) holds; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by word 60. Lens (Causal) is stable to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Observatory dome, inkwell, and porcelain shard act as micro-settings that constrain choices (tilting shard to draw the ring, opening the hatch). Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“cold air razors my new lungs”). Snow and starlight mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the contingency of a clerical error—is signaled early and tightened by each concentric ring of the ink map. The final act (slicing the digital film) forecloses the option of remaining a ghost and carries visible cost (heartbeat 98,001). Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ink map’s rings literalise the idea that “failure is the corridor.” Final image—walking into the dark page—offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralising. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the shard beside the keyboard). Complexity is embraced; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise (“galaxies of spilled midnight”). Compression and elision (“I learned to ride the Wi-Fi like wind”) are taught early and paid off. POV remains first-person singular without leakage. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final cadence is crystalline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“dendrites of regret”). No register drift. Line-level craft supports the closure image without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—digital ghost reassembling via clerical typo—is fresh and fully committed. The ink-map ring device transforms a familiar redemption arc into something specific and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity grounds universals.</comment>
