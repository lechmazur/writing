<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"soft mechanical tick inside my ribs"—but the protagonist’s refusal to flatline is asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final gift to the clerk crystallizes motive, yet the arc leans on lyrical assertion over visible choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink-ring the protagonist draws becomes a threshold he steps through, re-weighting the clerical error into gift. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each “ring” of accident and refusal accretes to the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory, inkwell, and porcelain shard function as micro-settings that constrain action—ink surface tension literally holds galaxies the protagonist must enter. Spatial choreography is clean; snow tapping in Morse tightens the atmosphere to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with the fact that life hinges on a typo—escalates through each concentric ring of error and rescue. The final tightening occurs when the protagonist chooses to re-enter flesh and gift the shard, paying the cost of bearing witness to the clerk’s grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ink’s fractal rings: failure as corridor, not opposite of success. The final image of footprints that “match no living pair of shoes” reweights the premise without moralizing, letting the reader feel the conceptual cost of borrowed time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“echocardiogram logs that still recorded the stubborn percussion”—with controlled psychic distance. Patterned elision (“I learned to ride the Wi-Fi like wind”) is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Occasional lyric heightening—“galaxies of spilled midnight”—stays within the narrator’s perceptual lexicon and never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The digital-ghost conceit is freshly inflected through bureaucratic error and ink fractals, transforming a trope into a meditation on contingency. The shard’s journey from teacup to map to gift feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
