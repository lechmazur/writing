<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cassia’s interiority is vivid—dreams bleeding green, coat of childhood dropping away—but the chimera’s motives remain opaque; her final renunciation of identity is earned by the thread-weaving journey yet lacks a visible cost on her body or future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the garden is the instant of letting go, crystallized when the ship folds into a pop-up book. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each recovered thread reweights memory—though the golden-blood coordinates blink too conveniently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fog-thick bay, popcorn-rust stink, ankle-deep bilge: every sensory choice pressures Cassia’s footing and mood. The emerald card’s hologram playground and the oxidized-copper carousel horse charge the final image, constraining her last step onto dissolving initials.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find the garden—tightens as each recovered thread dissolves a former self; the carousel’s unspooling forecloses retreat. Cost is felt in the blissfully aberrant loss of certainty, though the chimera’s agency dilutes pure protagonist pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of identity as stitched, disposable costume emerges from the carnival detritus and the card’s crumbling dust; no moral is stated. The final image of EXIT spelled by barnacles reweights the quest as self-erasure, resonant without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed—“fog thick enough to chew”—with consistent perceptual bias; the chimera’s three-voiced echo and Cassia’s green-tinged dreams maintain distinct signatures. Experimental elision (“time obeyed different gravity”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors like “drowned idols” and “silver embroidery” serve atmosphere without clutter. Minor loop—“thread” repeated in close succession—dulls cadence once, but closure image remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Chimera twin discoverer in a derelict funhouse ship feels fresh; the chimera’s refusal of solace subverts oracle trope. Risky folding-ship ending works because the pop-up image recharges earlier motifs of childhood artifacts and memory threads.</comment>
