<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction, embodied emotion, and visible micro-choices arc Mireya from isolated caretaker to bridge-builder; the final “porous” seam is earned by granular cause (the four-language braid) not thematic hand-waving. Cost surfaces when exhaustion leaves her apron “glittering with metallic dust,” a tactile residue of the toll.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens is crisp: broken weight → tower silence → elevator refusal → choral braid → synchronized song at 4:43 AM. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands when the elevator’s final bass note dissolves the mechanical / human divide, reconfiguring both grain and metronomes into a communal score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clock-tower anatomy, river loam, and brass planetary rings are filtered through Mireya’s body (hoarse throat, stone stair) and constrain her tactics; the final “prisms on dew” reprises the first paragraph’s borrowed starlight and charges the closing image. No extraneous geography — every place earns action or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Single dominant stake — restore the grain-tower duet — escalates under causal pressure: cuckoo snaps weight, elevator withholds song, Mireya must braid tongues. Tightening narrows at “bridge me or let me rot,” forcing the decisive bridge-building act, cost legible in the exhale and glints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of bridge-making emerges from events: languages as wood planks, silos of isolation against communal need. The final image (“a bridge is a song you can walk across”) re-weights the premise without sermon. Resonance is earned via specific musical-mechanical fusion; wheat now “remembers” metronomes.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Single-focalizer voice owns a precise choral timbre (“copper syllables,” “alto descending scale”) and rhythmic modulation to scene pulse. Compression like “cold heart in palms” teaches the metaphor pattern early; closure image repays the pattern cleanly. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within plausible librarian lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Prose is luminous yet propulsive; no loops or synonym churn. Varied sentence length drives the ascent/descent rhythm of clock gears and star map. Figurative density is purposeful, pattern-led, and resolves in final line. No overwritten beats or ambiguous causals touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk, agricultural fantasy, and linguistics in a way that feels inevitable: “four languages at once” is not flourish but structural ligature. Elevator dialogue, brass planets, grain metronomes — each detail is original without gimmickry and binds the arc. The synthesis lands as non-obvious yet integral to closure.</comment>
