<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s empathetic decisiveness is dramatized through tactile micro-choices—cradling the lead cone, braiding languages, rehanging the weight—each with felt cost; the final exhaustion and “bridge is a song” line crystallize her arc without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower and elevator harmonize, the boundary between human and machine breath is “rehabilitated,” and the cost is the librarian’s spent body and the porous future she accepts; causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The clock tower’s brass rings, speaking tubes, and star-map murals constrain every move; the grain elevator’s cedar ribs vibrate in response, charging the final image with an audible bridge of resonance—setting actively shapes tactics and outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—restoring the lost song between iron and wood—tightens when the elevator threatens “let me rot,” forcing Mireya’s linguistic bridge-building; the cost is her dawn exhaustion and the irreversible porosity she creates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bridges as songs, silos as islands, wheat tasting of metronomes—no moralizing, only the resonant reweighting of human-machine custodianship in the final harmonized note.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“brass syllables,” “gritty vernacular of piston and prairie wind”—with rhythmic modulation under pressure; no head-hopping, and the choral librarian’s perceptual signature remains consistent and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“golden notes spilled like seed”), with no mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter even at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astronomical clock, talking grain elevator, and linguistic repair feels inevitable and fresh; the synthesis of starlight, grammar, and harvest memory is non-obvious yet wholly earned.</comment>
