<comment>Kael's desire to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is clear, but the interior logic is abstract; contradictory selves clash more conceptually than viscerally. The final obliteration of the tablet is an earned renunciation, but the minotaur's identity as "the sequence of choices" feels summarized, not embodied. Flaws remain gestural rather than lived, lowering from exceptional.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as deliberate, elegant Charged Poise: the tablet's destruction collapses timelines—time itself becomes the price. Drive is situational‐accumulative; pattern taught early, ruptures widen, then sudden stillness. No causality lapses; spatial/temporal anchors hold.</comment>

<comment>Viaduct is atmospheric and symbolic—glowing algae bones—but remains backdrop instead of active constraint. The open doorway into childhood closes the loop, giving late environment weight, but still more resonance than function.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates through timeline fractures until collapse; every intensification is authored by Kael's choices rather than coincidence. Cost is visible—time bleeding from cuts, final vanishing of selves—with a decisive act that forecloses return.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-erasure achieved by choice is underlined, not declared, culminating in a final, quiet doorway. Subtext of father/clock trauma is evocative yet thin; still, ambiguity is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<comment>Achieves distinctive rhythmic texture: “waterfall upward into night sky,” “rain sliced his coat,” sonic cohesion across beats. POV remains singular, no leakage; lyric compression taught early and paid back in final image.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sensory density is high; almost every sentence performs double duty. One minor figurative wobble: “wallpaper peeling like sunburned skin” jars slightly under pressure but never obscures closure.</comment>

<comment>Synthesizes time-fragment narrative with mythical labyrinth in fresh, personal terms. “Periodically eternal” tablet is an original device; turns are inevitable in hindsight without late rule patches.</comment>
