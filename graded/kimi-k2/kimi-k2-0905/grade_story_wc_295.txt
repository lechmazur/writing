<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers still smelling of ink”), but the chronicler’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized; the final renunciation (“I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled”) is earned yet the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the temple dissolves, the star brightens, and the chronicler carries the echo forward. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off with a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the premise. One minor causality wobble: the exact trigger for the temple’s dissolution is implied rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Copper-domed observatory, star-charts rustling like birds, and the daylily-pressed telegram all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful; the telescope’s brass healing under spectral ink is a micro-setting beat that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the temple before the star dims—is signaled early and tightened once when the star’s fade becomes a doorway. Agency is observational rather than active, but the deepening of knowledge carries visible cost as the chronicler absorbs collective grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the temple’s inscriptions and the chronicler’s realization; the final inscription reframes grief into light without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is character-specific (“bruise-shaped syllables”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical with no loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Rhythm accelerates with pressure and breathes at closure. One minor over-modification in “celestial period at the end of a sentence that would never need rewriting.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of lucid dreaming, variable-star Morse, and grief-encoded temples feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the daylily telegram and SS Lacertae’s 19.3-hour pulse anchors the fantastical in tactile detail. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
