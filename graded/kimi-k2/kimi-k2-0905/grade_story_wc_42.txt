<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid yet drifts toward poetic therapy-speak near the end; the final smile lands because the cost has been dramatized, but the motivation to “restructure herself” feels asserted rather than deeply forged in causal micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure earns an Earned Stasis: she photographs the station collapsing and lets the image—literal film—absorb every future she relinquishes. All causal beats are on-page, the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, and the shutter click is a clean conceptual DC with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station is rendered through purposeful fragments rather than tour-guide detail; every telescoped corridor lensing moonlight, vibrating floor, or collapsing bulkhead constrains Mira’s route toward the emergency shuttle. Final image folds observatory into photograph, environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to harness the ephemeral”—is present from the leaf vignette onward and tightens into a single irrevocable choice: let the image take everything or stay. Escalation comes as the building literally folds itself into film; visible price prevents reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Central theme (letting go as the highest repair) emerges from imagery rather than proclamation; recurring leaf sound evolves from guiding countdown to final lonely moonlet. Final resonance comes from material image in hand—not lecture—giving weight to “changelessly constant decay.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Lyrical yet never monotonous; sentence tempo lengthens and contracts to match the humming tremor. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, diction stays within plausible tech-poet range, and the POV holds in Mira’s sensorium without slippage or explain-alls.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Compression is tight; nearly every sentence toggles image or action. Occasional lyric stacking could edge toward purple but pattern is taught early and paid in the folding steel moment. No loops, near-duplicate stems, or scaffold clutter visible at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms space-exploration elegy into literal film-negative closure, a synthesis not seen elsewhere. Premise is familiar but made specific by lunar-dust lubricant, leaf sound in vacuum, and telescope folding—transformed by internal logic not showpiece gimmickry.</comment>
