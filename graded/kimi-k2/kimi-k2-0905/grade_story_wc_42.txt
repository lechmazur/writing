<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s 30-year solitude and precise ritual on the final night give a vivid, contradictory presence: restorer caretaker finally choosing self-restructure. The decision to fold the station and board the shuttle is legible, but interiority occasionally wavers toward lyric abstraction instead of embodied contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: a Resonant Reconfiguration—the observatory collapses into the photograph, leaving Mira in orbital escape with a felt, unspoken cost. Under an Accumulative/Textural drive, the final beat makes the “before” of the station and the “after” of the image/leaf sound indivisible. No causality breaks, and disorientation is taught early then paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory, Hasselblad, and the lone falling leaf each constrain the one available tactic—photograph extinction rather than salvage. Spatial anchor is immediate; station bulkheads and viewport leaf evolve causally with the quaking shutter. A near-9, minus only the minor white-room feel during the corridor trek.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The single dominant stake—hold/fix time vs. release—is signaled on line one and escalates as the chronometer accelerates. One decisive turn: Mira chooses self-restructure (boarding shuttle) with on-page cost (loss of home and role). Escalation is more tonal/accretive than causal; therefore capped under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from image, never label: repair vs. release, permanence vs. impermanence. The observatory-as-film-frame ending reframes every prior fixation tool into a negative of her own leaving. Subtext in the “leaf sound” lingers hauntingly without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical density is consistent, pattern-taught; sentence rhythm breathes with the station’s tremor. Interiority feels character-bound rather than imposed voiceover. No register drift; the voice’s astronomical lexicon stays credible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Virtuosic figurative layering creates occasional density muddle in the floor-harmonic passage; small loop at “luminous ache” repeated near climax dampens propulsion. Otherwise lines do plural work, and the final image lands clean.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>A lunar camera repairer photographing her own abandonment is non-obvious and specific. Risky metaphysics (space leaf, chronometric escape) never tips into gimmickry because the closure internalizes them. Achieves fresh synthesis without genre cliché.</question>
