<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cael’s interiority is lyrically specific and embodied (“his teeth ache”), but the story leans on ancestral memory rather than on-page contradiction; the final stillness is earned yet the cost is more abstract than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Cael becomes the echo—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the arrowhead’s merger with his sternum crystallizes the before/after with conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bone towers and layered dust are not mere backdrop; their resonance literally tunes Cael’s sternum, constraining the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the wandering pulse—tightens once, when the towers answer his song. The pressure is coherent, but the cost is more metaphysical than tangible, keeping it just under the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and silence: home is not ahead but already within. The final image reweights all prior motion without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent; the lyric diction never drifts. The perceptual signature is distinct—Cael hears the world as harmonics—and the prose teaches its pattern early and pays it off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level craft is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Only minor scaffold (some repeated “bone towers” phrasing) keeps it from 9.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The harmonic stone-skimmer mythos feels freshly synthesized; the premise of navigating by stillness is non-obvious and fully committed to. Specificity anchors the lyric flight.</comment>
