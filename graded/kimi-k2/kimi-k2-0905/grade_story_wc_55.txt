<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the cracked-gear guilt and the seed-as-ending crystallize her arc. The micro-choice to release the dream is earned and costly. Minor drift: “excruciatingly gentle” repeats without fresh embodiment in the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed tucked into stone reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of remembered rain → seed → linden tree. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory forecourt and linden seed constrain final choice; crystal tiles and rainwater act as micro-setting that charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making peace with abandoned dream—tightens once when Elara releases it. Cost is felt in the splitting bear and the seed left behind. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of time-as-patience emerges from concrete particulars; final linden tree offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the bear’s split and seed’s constellations reweights earlier ambition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature (petrichor nostalgia, glacial hush) remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional beats. Minor cadence repetition in “excruciatingly gentle.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern. One paraphrase loop (“excruciatingly gentle”) and a near-mixed metaphor (“cracked gear in her chest”) keep it from 9+. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial chronometer reimagined as arboreal timekeeper. Linden seed as clock-face is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
