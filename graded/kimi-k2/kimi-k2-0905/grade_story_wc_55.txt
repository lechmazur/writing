<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is precise and embodied—his contradictory impulses (to finish the clock vs. to surrender it) coexist in every beat. The final renunciation is earned by the long causal chain of failed prototypes and felt cost: “the weight had transferred into the stones.” No stock phrasing; every image is filtered through his sensory bias.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream is abandoned and reweighted as listening, with visible cost—the brass corpse left to verdigris. Causal linkage holds: because the investors demanded louder ticks, therefore he flees; because the clock dies, therefore he lays it down. Lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is not backdrop but active constraint: its cold “hummed,” forcing the choice to surrender the brass. Micro-setting (the brass hatch, the frost-feathered case) doubles as character crucible. Final image—the green fire no one will see—recharges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measure the hush vs. accept the hush—is signaled early and tightened once: the stuttered tick dies, forcing renunciation. Escalation is causal and legible; the price is the abandoned prototype and the inherited stillness. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: time as gentle listening rather than blade. Subtext operates in gesture—the pendulum laid “like a frozen tear.” Final image of green fire offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyrical compression, selective sensory bias (“petrichor nostalgia,” “glacial hush”), rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at the climax. Dialogue absent by design; prose carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is precise—“clock that would measure the glacial hush between heartbeats”—and never muddles causality. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a clockmaker who stops time by surrendering measurement. The inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure paid off by coherent closure. No close echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
