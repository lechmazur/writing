<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied ("sweat absorbed by saffron veil"), but the historian’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned by micro-choices under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pagoda locket crystallizes her new stance with felt cost ("too heavy for one person to carry alone"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of nostalgic atoms and prism reflections tightens until the final reconfiguration. One minor drift: the exit door’s mechanics appear late without prior cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Archive is evoked through sensory density ("copper tears," "screaming equations") that constrains movement; the bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting, multiplying in reflections to guide her path. Spatial choreography is coherent; transitions from archive to wasteland are legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to purify memories or carry them—tightens once when atoms of nostalgia cluster at her throat. Agency is visible: she chooses to become librarian, then rejects it. Cost is felt but diffuse; the price of carrying the pagoda locket could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as beautiful contamination rather than purity. Final image of freckles mapping constellations reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in "we were innocent until we learned what we had lost" resonates through gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature is selective ("moth refusing the moon's geometry"). No dialogue to judge; POV remains stable. Patterned elision ("steadily unpredictable") is taught early and paid off at exit door.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors ("atoms of nostalgia drift like luminous dust...") risk overwriting but serve the accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs and sensory specificity carry momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archive trope through tactile nostalgia atoms and prism reflections. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test passed: story would collapse without these exact elements.</comment>
