<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is vivid—her sweat absorbed by the saffron veil, her backward-forward exit—but the emotional arc is more archetypal than individual; the “beautiful contamination” insight feels arrived at rather than wrested from specific contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she steps through the paradoxical door carrying the pagoda-shrunk-to-locket, accepting perpetual custodianship. The lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; each shard of imagery reweights the stake of remembrance versus erasure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda, copper-tasting air, and freckle-constellations are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the micro-setting of the locket-sized pagoda at the end constrains her future choices, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve memory without being consumed by it—tightens when she realizes purification means self-erasure. The cost is felt: she becomes the next librarian, exile in the wasteland, pagoda her only lantern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of “beautiful contamination”: memory scars rather than cleanses. The final image of freckle-constellations and shared lullaby-songs offers a non-literal answer—carry the wound gently—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“atoms of nostalgia,” “screaming equations”) is taught early and paid off. The collective “they” at the end modulates distance intentionally, crystallizing the communal stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors (“moth refusing the moon’s geometry”) are precise. Occasional stacked abstractions (“beautiful contamination of being human”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic archive, quantum nostalgia, and saffron relic feels fresh; the backward-forward exit and locket-compass are inventive yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
