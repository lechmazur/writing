<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—archivist tenderness vs. ruthless excision—are dramatized in the lace-noose gesture and the final shared walk; Kestrel’s blankness cracks only when he kneels for a name. Interiority is embodied, never diagnostic. The cost of her vow is visible in the abandoned rifle and the moving eclipse she now carries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the pair renounce violence and the next king’s narrative, the cost legible in the useless rifle and the unreadable final sentence they inscribe together. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each walking pattern and whispered name layers density until the dawn reweights what stories survive. No orientation debt; anchors are taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s stone mouths and lantern circles constrain every stealth step; the chessboard’s pawn-less squares mirror the city’s hierarchy and charge the final image when Mara wraps it in her cloak. Sensory detail is selective—iron and lilac on the air, carved mane against palm—filtered through Mara’s survival priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve small truths before the next king’s erasure—tightens when the gallery demands “Record us” and peaks as Mara and Kestrel trade gunfire for memory. Agency drives escalation: each spelled word narrows their tactical options until dawn forces the final stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory and power; the lace noose and unreadable final sentence reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gestures—kicked knight, slung rifle—never exposition. The ending’s luminous absence offers a resonant, non-literal answer to who gets remembered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under patrol boots and breathes during the slow spelling of “Adel.” Perceptual signature is Mara’s—nomadic penumbra, wingbone letters—never head-hops. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual: “Tell me the name of the maid who dropped the teacup.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—“stone mouths,” “moving eclipse”—and never muddle causality. High information density with varied rhythm supports the final crystallized image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The crisis-actor-turned-archivist, pawn-less chessboard, and walking alphabet synthesize into a fresh angle on post-war memory. The risk—renouncing violence through a game of absence—pays off with earned resonance. Specificity (lace noose, Adel’s curtsy) prevents template drift.</comment>
