<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s cool composure is embodied in every micro-choice; the rail-spike act crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete—no stock phrasing—and her final “stay” choice is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the goddess’s dialogue edges toward label-speak (“echo you chase”), blunting full contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s hush and “answered question that refuses to stop asking” reweight meaning with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of sonic vines → rail-spike crevice → silence channel is taught early and holds. One transition (garden → tideline) is legible; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden and rail spike function as micro-setting that constrains tactics: every footstep blooms a chord, the spike splits the sound bed. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered (“lavender reeds,” “iron remembering”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—tightens when the star-woman demands a cry; Mara’s rail-spike act forecloses noise and redefines the conflict. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of sonic vines and stellar descent. Cost is legible: garden’s silence and starfire-warmed spike.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of divinity as conversation emerges from concrete action, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: silence voiced, echo returned as “Stay.” Final image recharges earlier motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, patterned, voice-consistent. POV stays tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction (“feral lullabies,” “sonic vines”) is controlled and purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors cohere (“stars…like sleepwalkers tangled in glittering nets”). Rhythm modulates with stakes; no overwriting in peak beats. Clean grammar and spatial clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-wave garden + rail spike + silence-as-net feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices; no derivative echo.</comment>
