<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mila’s interior contradiction—yearning vs. enforced silence—is embodied in the rosin-ink ritual; her micro-choice to transmit at solstice crystallizes the arc with visible cost (lost anonymity, Ministry inhalation). Traits shape speech and worldview; no stock labels. The Earned Stasis—she keeps copying amid fallout—feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chord rewrites the Ministry’s reality on the page (“uniforms shedding ash”). Causal chain—copyist learns code → builds antenna → transmits dust—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (alcove → city street) is legible; no orientation drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember alcove’s iron-tasting mist and green dial glow constrain every action; the copper filament antenna woven through the pit is a micro-setting that directly enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy (rosin, iron, phosphor) mirrors Mila’s focus. Final image of mist carrying chord recharges the opening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle narrative back into the world—tightens when the broadcaster announces the solstice deadline. Agency: Mila’s decision to amplify dust narrows her options irreversibly. Cost is visceral: inspectors inhale the chord and stagger. One deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: banned stories encoded in intervals, dust as memory, rosin as voice. Final image of passersby “recalling a dream” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence and vibration; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and musically literate—“dust remembers the bow,” “intervals bent like light.” Perceptual signature is copyist-specific: she notices rests, fermatas, parchment grain. No head-hopping; distance stays intimate. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, action, or stakes. Metaphors are coherent and earned. No loops or scaffold. “Thistled calm” and “green phosphor planet” are fresh without purple overload. Final line lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: banned narrative encoded in musical intervals, dust as archive, rosin as ink. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes; premise commits fully. Transformation test passed—story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
