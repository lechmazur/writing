<comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—private skepticism vs compassionate need to help—surfaces in “affectionate skepticism” toward objects, yet the shift from doubt to messianic certainty (“I can actually heal”) is asserted by gloss rather than dramatized through micro-choices. Embodied cost (finger ache) is momentary, not sustained; the final stance feels gifted rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage falters once: the muscovite’s “maps of thought-shields” spring full-formed after a single static shock, with no earlier foreshadowing or staged discovery beat. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the studio lights reconfigure stakes—but the pivot is narrated rather than earned through an on-page decisional beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Basement light-studio anchoring is vivid (geode glinting, projector beams, mirror choreography) and supplies the final image, but the environment never constrains tactics beyond optical possibilities already assumed by “light painting studio.” Momentum isn’t slowed by excess scenic detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore mental privacy for pill victims—is stated early and met with escalated success, yet the rising pressure is reported (people “soon lined up”) rather than dramatized through a tightening beat inside the studio. Agency is mostly off-screen outreach rather than a visible trade-off here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—rebuilding boundaries without retreating from connection—emerges organically from the geode–light technology and the pill’s social wound. Avoids moralizing, but the final line (“trust both science and intuition”) edges close to an abstract summary that mildly dulls resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice stays clean, slightly heightened lyrical tech diction (“mica resonances,” “fractally precise”) yet consistent and tied to Mira’s artistic-scientist POV. No line-level tangles; prose breathes with scene needs without lapses into jargon dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is smooth; sentence variety good but a few elevated adjectives verge on surplus (“refracting the projections into fractally precise patterns”). No loops or redundancies obscure causality; final two sentences edge overwrought but not enough to mar clarity.</question>

<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Combining mineral optics with telepathy backlash is fresh, but the premise’s speculative pivot—static shock instantly unlocking a complete shield-making protocol—relies on convenient resonance rather than prior seeded constraints, keeping the leap from feeling inevitable.</comment>
