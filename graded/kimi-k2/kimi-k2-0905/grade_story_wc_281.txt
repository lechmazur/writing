<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s affectionate skepticism is embodied early and flips credibly when the geode’s warmth forces her to accept telepathic evidence; the final choice to illuminate healing pathways is earned by prior sensory overload and costs her detachment. Interiority stays concrete, but the shift from observer to empathic conduit is slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: static shock → geode activation → telepathic flood → collaborative light-web → photograph as Charged Poise. Closure lands with felt cost—Maya’s skepticism permanently altered—though the beat-to-beat causality leans on atmospheric accretion rather than strict because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Light-painting studio is rendered through tactile LEDs, fiber optics, and camera aperture; the geode itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice by amplifying minds. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the widower’s “dark voids” flirt with overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain skeptical or accept telepathic communion—tightens once the geode warms and forces Maya to act. The cost is the irreversible loss of her detached stance; pressure escalates via sensory overload rather than external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisible human connection emerges through the literalized light-web; no moralizing, only the photograph’s afterimage as Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in somatic markers (breath, shoulder tension) carries the emotional weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature is scientific yet lyric (“fractally precise patterns seeming to shift and breathe”). No head-hopping; diction modulates with rising awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“ethereal spirals and waves… ghostly brushstrokes”) risk overwriting in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with shutter timing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy-pill recall + muscovite amplifier + light-painting as telepathic canvas. The conceit feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids stock psychic tropes by grounding perception in somatic markers.</comment>
