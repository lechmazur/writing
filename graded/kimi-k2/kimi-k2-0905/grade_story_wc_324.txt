<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “decades-old hearing aid tuned to the frequency of the dead” is a concrete, character-specific lens. The micro-choice to press the photograph against the wall crystallizes her values and drives the climax. The final silence of the aid is a credible, earned renunciation with visible cost. Only minor slip: the niece’s emergence is externally impelled, not forced by Mira’s flaw, so the relational crucible is one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the synchronized heartbeat reconfigures meaning and costs Mira her guiding static. Causal chain holds—photo → pulse → wall → niece—each beat because/therefore. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One persistent constraint (the aid’s final silence) shapes the last image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: condensation drops “small ghosts” mirror internal stakes and guide Mira’s circling. The carousel photograph re-enters as charged object, its colors brightening in the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—sound of static, taste of iron/lilies—filtered through Mira’s synesthetic bias. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver the dead’s last pulse—signaled in paragraph 1. Mid-story tightening when the pulse turns “urgent” forces Mira across the atrium, narrowing options. Cost legible: Mira forfeits her vocation’s signal once the niece receives the beat. Agency is present-tense attention, not external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening as moral act emerges through image and gesture, never sermon. The reeling hush motif migrates from atmosphere to the niece’s whisper, reweighting silence as earned peace. Final carousel reprise offers non-literal answer: cycles can be unbroken by an act of hearing. No thesis statement; ambiguity lingers about who else might call.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled: “the mist-clad atrium…swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light” teaches compression early. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for drift, fragments for pulse spikes. No head-hopping; perception stays anchored to Mira’s body and aid. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or causality. Figurative language is patterned (velvet/mist/ghosts) and paid off in the carousel reveal. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density: “penny candy and chlorine” evokes era, class, and lost summer in four words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—“contact tracer for hearts” via antique hearing aid—is fresh yet immediately legible. Risky lyric compression taught by line 2 and sustained without clarity loss. Carousel photograph transforms from nostalgic prop to reparative conduit; hindsight feels inevitable. Specificity of 1952-2018 Eleanor Whitaker inscription anchors the fantastical in lived history.</comment>
