<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity and moral drive are concrete from the first beat; the hearing-aid dial twist is a micro-choice that externalizes interiority. The final lie to Hask and the quiet collar-adjust show contradictory impulses—protection vs. compassion—under pressure. Cost is visible: she forfeits institutional safety and retires the aid, a tactile renunciation. Interiority stays embodied; no diagnostic self-talk.

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dial spike → photograph → ledger → upload → confrontation; each because/therefore narrows options. Closure is a decisive change—public credit transferred, Hask neutralized—paid for by Mira’s career risk and the dead battery of the aid. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (conservatory, twilight, clipboard). No teleporting props; the postcard warmth cues recent handling and motivates the bend to pick it up.

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium is not backdrop; its swallowed sound justifies the hearing-aid premise and forces the tactile search. Condensation-recorded heartbeats on rusted pipes mirror the archival quest, binding setting to theme. The koi-pond edge becomes a tactical pivot point—one step from destruction—so environment constrains choice. Sodium-orange lamp and orchid rot supply multisensory specificity without catalog bloat.

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect Lila’s voice from erasure—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the ledger’s location is revealed. One meaningful escalation: upload triggers alarm, collapsing Mira’s exit options. Cost is legible—career exposure, aid silenced—so the final image carries weight. Coincidence (photo under bench) complicates rather than resolves; it seeds the confrontation.

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stolen valor emerges through the red ledger, the warm postcard, and Hask’s trembling fingers—no explicit thesis. Final image of sunrise burning off mist reweights earlier “mist-clad” line: obscurity lifted, history corrected. Ambiguity remains—Ministry may still spin the story—so moral is not tidied. Subtext in “Let their hearts finish speaking” carries more force than any slogan.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world through hearing-aid pulses and chemical scent of emulsion. Syntax tightens under pressure—“voice calm as fibrillation” marries medical precision to emotional stakes. No head-hopping; Hask’s collapse is observed from outside. Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven: “I found nothing but fungus” conceals and accuses simultaneously.

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences carry dual duty—“clipboard labeled ‘contact tracer for hearts’ already half-draped in moss” seeds premise and decay in one breath. Metaphors stay coherent: velvet swallows light, mist swallows sound, ledger swallows credit. No scaffold loops; each paragraph advances knowledge or stance. Minor elevation in “sodium-orange” is justified by POV’s archival eye.

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh conceptual hinge that literalizes emotional epidemiology. The hearing-aid-as-medium reframes ghost story as archival heist without trope clutter. Heroism is traced, not claimed—an angle that feels inevitable once revealed. Risk is taken: bureaucratic gothic merged with whispered séance, yet coherence holds.
