<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority deepens under literal pressure; every micro-choice—unscrewing tray, aligning charm—manifests her quest for meaning. Contradictory impulses (healing vs. sinking) act simultaneously. The final renunciation—pressing the charm against the glass—earns closure with visible cost. Earned mourning expressed via embodied action and mercury-infused kintsugi nets high emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieved: statue healed + workshop lost = conceptual repricing with undeniable cost transferred to Lira. Causal linkage tightens from pattern alignment to last breath; no coincidence resolves outcome. Orientation anchored within 120 words via anchor-chains and acid sea kissing iron. Single scene window holds under causal drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice—acid chains’ last four links function as live countdown. Micro-setting (body on rebreather timer, tool wrist-key charm) edits tactics. Specificity: acid kissing iron, mercury heartbeat locked in glass. Final acid hiss higher + light descending charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save statue or save workshop—mutually exclusive. Tightening foreclosed live option; each healed pockmark equals one lost chain link. One meaningful tightening before closure initiated. Cost visible: workshop slides into sea after last chain parts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars: memory as constellation stitches past into sigil. Kintsugi reframed as stitching corrosion into meaning without plea for resurrection. Final image reweights earlier pockmarks as not wounds but star maps. Quiet but resonant without stated moral.</comment>
