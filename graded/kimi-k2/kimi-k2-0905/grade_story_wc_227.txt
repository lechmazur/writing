<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to save memory yet fearing the cost—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned by the prior liturgy of dots and the workshop’s audible countdown. Embodied emotion (trembling masked by rebreather, acid on chains) stays specific. Only minor slip: “uncertain alchemist” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: Lira’s deliberate act sinks the workshop while the charm ascends, a felt cost legible in the snapped chains and flooding rebreather. Causal linkage holds—each dot traced tightens the stakes until the final transfer of weight. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. Lens (Causal) is stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Acid sea, corroded statue, and ticking rebreather form a micro-setting that actively constrains tactics—every exhalation is rationed. Sensory detail is selective (acid hiss, gear clank) and filtered through Lira’s professional priorities. The healed statue at the end recharges the opening image with luminous reversal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—meaning versus survival—tightens with each snapped chain; agency is Lira’s deliberate press of the charm against the glass. Escalation is mechanical and irreversible. Cost is visible: four chains → one → none. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the acid simply keeps its bargain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of “damage accepted, memory endures” emerges from the literal quilting of scars to charm; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image—statue eyes opening as the workshop sinks—reweights all prior pockmarks into luminous scars without a sermon. Subtext lives in the golden lacquer swallowing her name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, and alchemist-specific: “acid sea kissed the iron,” “kintsugi intentions,” “liturgy of puncture.” Rhythm accelerates with the chain countdown. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (counting seconds, cataloguing craters) stays consistent. Dialogue absent, appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances pressure or image. Metaphors (“star map of ruin,” “tectonic teeth grinding”) are precise and paid off. No loops, no scaffold. Minor elevated diction (“oblivion,” “sigil”) fits the elevated stakes without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi as literal memory-quilting against an acid-sea apocalypse. The floating gear-workshop and mercury heartbeat are specific inventions, not stock tropes. Risky ending—sinking the protagonist—earned by prior causality. Transformation test: story collapses if kintsugi or acid sea is swapped out.</comment>
