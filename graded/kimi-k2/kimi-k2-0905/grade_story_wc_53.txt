<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“I pocket whatever frame feels heaviest”), but the scavenger’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the final swap feels inevitable yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the blank frame becomes a mirror, enacting a decisive change with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each surrendered year reweights memory—and the pattern is taught early by the moon-camera’s sprocket leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cloud-spongy vapor, neon horses under the surface, and the brass hub on the far bank are tactile and selective; the moon-camera wheel constrains every choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading years for existence—tightens with each surrendered frame; agency is visible in the thumb hesitating over 2015. Cost is legible: the ghost gains solidity while the narrator forgets the Nikon’s weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of eroded identity emerges from the fragment-collecting conceit and the final mirror-swap; no moralizing, only the resonant reconfiguration that the self is what it has bargained away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—filmstrip rattle, brass hornets, disposable-camera moon—maintained under pressure; lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is dense yet precise (“moon was a disposable camera wheel”), rhythm modulates with stakes, and no mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Carousel-as-time-camera and ghost-negotiation premise is fresh; the fragment-collector conceit transforms familiar afterlife tropes into a specific, irreversible economy of memory.</comment>
