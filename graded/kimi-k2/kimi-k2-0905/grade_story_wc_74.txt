<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia, hope, and artistic compulsion are embodied in tactile choices—mixing indigo, breathing the mural alive—culminating in earned exhaustion that forecloses further sleepless nights. The arrival of Jules crystallizes her private act into communal gift, showing relational stakes without headcount clutter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the greenhouse becomes a lung exhaling lost syllables, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the city’s night air. Causality holds—each stroke of the crescent brush tightens the spell until the final glyph dries with visible cost: Mira’s collapse into seventeen hours of sleep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, moonlit glass, and smog below constrain every move; the cracked mirror and indigo steam are micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the greenhouse’s air thickens like a throat, guiding Mira’s wrist and the reader’s breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the mural before dawn—tightens as moonlight wanes and the brush glows with sound. One decisive intensification: the mural’s purpose shifts from private compulsion to communal gift, paid with Mira’s spent wakefulness and Jules’s shared breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of remembered kindness emerges through concrete particulars—coins on buses, sandwiches to hitchhikers—never stated. The final image of marigolds on windshields offers a non-literal answer: kindness is a seed carried on exhaled syllables.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and insomnia-sharp: “moon-tipped,” “saffron quiet,” “turmeric she sprinkled on canvases to coax pigment into dreaming.” No head-hopping; Jules’s entrance is external, filtered through Mira’s moonlit perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and sound without redundancy. Metaphors are precise—“greenhouse felt like the inside of a throat learning to speak”—and never muddle causality. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia as lantern, lost language as pollen, mural as lung. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when the city exhales kindness. No derivative echoes; the crescent brush and abolished tongue feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
