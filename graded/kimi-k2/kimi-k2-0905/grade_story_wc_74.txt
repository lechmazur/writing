<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s insomnia, chosen medium, and mural-as-lung all nest inside her psychology; the final, image-level cost—exhaustion and public kindness spreading—feels both specific and internally compelled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mural arc follows a tight causal chain from theft-shop brush to greenhouse glyphs that literally exhale lost languages, culminating in an earned, charged-poise image of communal breath and marigolds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ivied greenhouse, moonlit glass, turmeric dust—each micro-setting detail constrains movement and metaphor, while the smog below remains a physical and moral counterweight in the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes rise through each glyph’s audible hiss: each word surfaces a lost city and demands the next until the mural becomes a lung, a tightening that visibly costs Mira’s stamina and the city’s silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory, anonymity, and gift-exchange: the theme pulses in indigo steam and marigold pollen rather than discourse, achieving reconfiguration when strangers unknowingly inhale remembered kindness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush narrates in precise, saffron-toned cadence; interior monologue avoids therapy-speak while fusing perception with peat dust and bruised marigolds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression and moon-lit hiss quicken rhythm; a few ornamental “moonlit faces” aside, sentences tighten toward the indigo final glyph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical mythos of lost languages in moth-eaten thrift-shop brush is fresh; yet greenhouse-as-lung risks echoing eco-parable, slightly diluting the non-obvious edge.</comment>
