<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guard’s interiority is sparse but consistent—dreamlessness, duty, and the ritual of naming anchor his choices. The final act of planting the clock and surrendering the sparks is earned by prior ritual and memory. The contradiction between duty and tenderness is implied, not dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the buried clock splits midnight, the sparks are transferred, and the children march on. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beat layers memory, song, and light until the final image reweights everything. Cost is legible in the guard’s emptied coat and the extinguished dune.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing dune, phosphorescent poppies, and buried rails are rendered with selective, sensory precision. The chess clock and strongbox function as micro-settings that constrain the final choice. Every detail either reflects the guard’s perception or becomes instrumental in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keeping the children’s dreams from leaking out—tightens through each beat: naming, opening the box, transferring sparks. Agency is ritualistic but active; the final planting forecloses the guard’s own return. The cost is the dune’s darkness and his solitary descent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accumulation: memory as living cargo, song as resistance to erasure, light as fragile continuity. The final image of lantern-children marching reframes the entire forest’s loss without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture, silence, and the ticking of a buried clock.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is the guard’s dreamless precision. Patterned elision (“occasionally everywhere,” “wave functions”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the distance remains intimate yet restrained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (“pollen and starlight,” “midnight unzipping”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph crystallizes momentum without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum lyric, post-apocalyptic elegy, and lullaby is non-obvious yet inevitable. The chess clock as divergent archive, the wave-function children, and the glowing dune feel specific to this vision. Risk-taking in structure and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
