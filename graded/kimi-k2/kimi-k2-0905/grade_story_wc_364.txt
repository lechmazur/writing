<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Corin’s interiority is embodied and stakes-aligned; the “meek” label is shown through early hesitation then overturned by embodied resolve. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. defiance) coexist in-scene, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (loss of silk, risk of collapse). Minor slip: “meek” is asserted once rather than fully dramatized before the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arches’ song reweights the planet’s dream and the magicians’ power. Causal chain holds—silk guides → lift cut → mural tethers → gong awakens—each step narrowing options. Cost is legible in the dissolved silk and the trembling arches. One transition (lift cut) is abrupt but pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and stakes-active: upside-down roots, floating arches that citizens fear, slag that “sighs.” The orchard planet and mine shafts constrain every move; the final image of singing arches is charged by prior spatial logic. No orientation drift; geography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the planet from magician fear—tightens through each beat: silk trade, descent, mural tether, gong call. Escalation is causal and driven by Corin’s agency; cost accumulates (loss of tool, risk of collapse). One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “coaxing resilience from rubble” emerges from Corin’s actions and the mural’s dream; no moralizing. Subtext in the arches’ shift from threat to song. Final image reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Slight risk of abstraction in “azure defiance” phrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and POV-consistent; sensory diction (“bruised-azure,” “gravity-oxen”) feels lived-in. Compression and elision are purposeful and taught early. No dialogue, so voice carries all load; rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional elevated phrasing flirts with register drift but stays within Corin’s artisan lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free. Metaphors are coherent and grounded (“orchard rows of plex-citrus”). Sentence variety supports momentum; no scaffold or synonym churn. One minor mixed metaphor (“bruised-azure shadow”) does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar rebellion arc with fresh world logic (floating arches, upside-down roots, silk as compass). Transformation test passes: story would collapse without these specifics. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
