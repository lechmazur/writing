<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“loaded emptiness,” “teaching herself to suffocate”), but the keeper’s final choice—continuing to practice suffocation—feels more stated than dramatized; the boy’s arc lands harder than hers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper receives the boy’s “first real breath” and is left in Charged Poise, cost legible in “tomorrow she would practice suffocating again.” Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of shared scars → starlight breath tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s charcoal ruin and starlight tears are vivid, selective, and mirror internal states; the doorknocker ring and scorched circle act as micro-settings that constrain ritual choices. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeper must teach the dead to release—tightens through the boy’s encroachment and the shared-scar ritual; cost is felt in her renewed vow to keep suffocating. One clear deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “learning to die properly before living” emerges organically from the ritual and keeper’s self-inflicted practice; final image of starlight breath reweights earlier ember motif without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature (“frozen tears,” “loaded emptiness”) stays consistent. No dialogue, so no voice drift; compression and elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“starlight like frozen tears,” “bridge she had carefully burned”) flirt with overwriting but remain coherent. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar afterlife-mentor trope is refreshed by suffocation-as-teaching-device and scars-as-conduit; specific lived detail (charcoal sanctuary, doorknocker ring) grounds the concept. Risky lyric mode pays off.</comment>
