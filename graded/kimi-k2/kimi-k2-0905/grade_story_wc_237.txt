<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulses—terror vs trust, revision vs grief—are embodied in the crystallizing breath and quill fracture. The micro-choice to finish the twelfth stroke despite needles in her lungs earns the spiral release. Brother’s fall and her held-breath ritual anchor motive without exposition dump. Cost is visible: quill snaps, rock rises, silence changes texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: misdrawn rune → held breath → twelfth stroke → spiral release → rock rises. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“floating rock drifted…tea-dark lake”). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: crystallized shards become speakable words, rock ascends—cost is the split quill and the audible click that shatters her chest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating rock, tatami circle, kettle plume, squid-ink jade—all constrain timing and breath. Micro-setting of the quill’s split tip charges the final image. Weather and platform height shift with emotional stakes. Sensory hierarchy narrows to breath, ink, steam under typhoon pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can she rewrite grief before the kettle plume rises? Pressure tightens with each stroke and heartbeat; failure means reliving brother’s fall. Agency is the deliberate choice to finish the twelfth stroke despite crystallized lungs. Cost: quill fractures, silence becomes speakable, rock ascends—felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral rune: scars become stories only when spoken aloud at cost. Subtext in Master Jomei’s silent nod and bergamot exhale. Final image—rock drifting higher after she speaks her brother’s name—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: grief isn’t erased, it’s transformed into flight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person limited stays inside Lina’s perceptual filter: “tasted of iron,” “heartbeat felt like a rune gone wrong.” Syntax mirrors held-breath tension—long sentences compress at stroke eleven. No head-hopping; Master Jomei’s minimal dialogue carries subtext. Voice coherent under pressure, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “storm clouds stacked above like bruised shelves” does double sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances breath, ink, or memory. Metaphors are precise and grounded. Final line “stories, unlike bodies, know how to fly” lands clean after earned spiral.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floating rock tea ceremony + rune magic + grief alchemy feels fresh, not checklist. Superstition of twelfth stroke becomes causal engine. Quill fracture and rock ascent synthesize image and theme. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure without gimmickry.</comment>
