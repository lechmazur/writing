<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory—her loosening grip on reality is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (pressing palm to stone, folding the swan). Motive remains consistent: witness without judgment, foreclosing the path of certainty. The final renunciation—accepting eventual forgetting—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor slip: “mercy” and “decay” are asserted rather than dramatized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keeper’s decision to stay by the river and let the swan’s map dissolve reconfigures her stance with felt cost (loss of the library’s tether). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake. Transitions (river ↔ catacombs) are legible via taught origami mechanic. No causality breaks; orientation anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and catacombs are not backdrops but tools: the stone’s silence anchors her psyche; the library’s moss-fed footnotes constrain movement. Micro-setting (origami swan) functions as portal key and ticking clock. Sensory hierarchy (volcanic glass, mold, candle smoke) filters through keeper’s eroding attention. Final image—moon as “silver scab”—recharges the setting’s wound motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witness without judgment vs. erosion of self. Escalation is textural—each return to the library adds weight (ink-dripping spines, multiplying marginalia). Tightening occurs when the swan’s paper thins, foreclosing endless return. Cost is conceptual: eventual dissolution of the map and her role. Agency is passive endurance; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory vs. impermanence, mercy in forgetting. Subtext lives in objects (swan as fragile archive, moon as scab). Final image reframes prior material—regenerative silence now teaches erasure, not preservation. No moralizing; ambiguity is purposeful. Resonance lingers through concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, archaic cadence, keeper’s perceptual signature (“moldy parchment and candle smoke”). Patterned elision (cryptic folds, backward river-name) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; interior texture coherent. Syntax mirrors eroding cognition: longer sentences collapse into fragments at closure. Register consistent; no filter-verb bloat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise (“shelves arched like whale ribs”) and internally coherent. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“regenerative silence”) is voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Final paragraph achieves crystalline stillness without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (librarian of lost time, origami portal) into singular vision. Fresh angle: keeper’s loosening grip as mercy, not tragedy. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—closure legible under Accumulative lens. Specificity (mercury floods, cinnamon-rust languages) prevents generic drift. Transformation test passed: story fails if elements swapped.</comment>
