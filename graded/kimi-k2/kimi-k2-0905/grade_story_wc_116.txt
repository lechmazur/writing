<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The keeper’s interiority is lyrically specific—“silence pool beneath the stone like breath held too long”—and her refusal to intervene after the war-chronicle bleeds saplings is a credible, costly stance. Yet the final surrender to become “the next fold” is foreshadowed only by abstract pattern, not by an earlier dramatized choice that would make the flattening feel inevitable rather than ordained.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keeper’s transformation into the next swan carries visible cost—“memories flatten, ink draining into the library’s roots”—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first obsidian touch to final feather. The circular structure is taught early and pays off, but the single causality hinge (she understands → she steps) is compressed into one sentence, slightly blunting the weight of the irrevocable act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment is never backdrop: the lectern-mirror that shows no reflection and the root-wrapped card catalog physically constrain movement and charge the final image. The obsidian refuge re-appears at start and finish, its cool weight anchoring the circular journey; every sensory detail is filtered through the keeper’s archivist bias—parchment smell, river damp on paper—so space breathes without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—tightens when the library punishes her single attempt to save a chronicle, proving silence is mandatory. The final ascent onto the mirror-water is a meaningful deepening that forecloses all future intervention, cost legible in her erased reflection; pressure escalates by accretion of impossible archives rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative image of folding: witness folds reality into weightless shape, then becomes the fold itself. No moral is stated; instead, the blank regenerating scrolls and the feather left for the next keeper reweight the premise, implying that history’s only durable form is the empty crease—an insight earned through the keeper’s centuries of silent tending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is sustained lyric-archivist: syntax elongates like corridors—“shelves folding into wings of paper cranes that dissolved into ash”—yet stays legible. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices crease-darkness, river-damp, ink-stained cuticles, never generic “magic.” No head-hopping; compression (“she understood: the library itself was the obsidian refuge”) is purposeful ellipsis taught by the swan’s prior folds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each metaphor extends the paper/silence motif without contradiction; no loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for descent, clipped fragments at the mirror-edge—accelerating into the final line. Only minor strain: “regenerative silence pool” risks nominalization, yet the phrase is reused enough to earn pattern status rather than clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The living archive that erases what it records is not new, but the origami-swan breadcrumb trail and the keeper’s self-origami transform the trope into intimate bodily stakes. Specificity—“juice of moon-berries,” “drawers sighed open at her touch”—makes the concept feel discovered rather than borrowed. Risk in circular structure pays off: the next keeper’s arrival reframes the entire text as one fold in an endless palimpsest.</comment>
