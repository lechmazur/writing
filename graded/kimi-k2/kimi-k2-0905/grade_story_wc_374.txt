<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—taste of ozone, ring’s pulse—but her decisive shift from skeptic to “recognizer” is asserted rather than dramatized; the cost is implied, not felt. No secondary pressure from on-page relationships.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ring’s final orientation reconfigures Mira’s stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; causality holds, though the “election” conceit remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora act as micro-setting that charges the final image; ring and taste channel cosmic/terrestrial duality. Sensory selection is purposeful, guiding attention toward convergence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why weather-carriers exist—tightens when the triangle forms and the ring spins. Pressure is atmospheric rather than confrontational; cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of chosen emotional stewardship emerges through image and ritual, not statement. Final “learn to dance with their storms” reweights premise with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—metallic heartbeat, copper pennies, wintergreen—sustained without drift. POV remains stable; sensory idiom is character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“terrestrially cosmic existence”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Weather-carrier premise feels freshly mythic; election of forests and taste-based navigation are non-obvious syntheses. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact particulars.</comment>
