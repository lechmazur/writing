<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the chronicler’s contradictory impulses (to record vs. to vanish) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—laying the scroll in the snow—earns its cost through prior grief for a life not yet lived. Minor drift: the “jaded wonder” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces landing (ending the story) and instead maps the wheel’s spokes, foreclosing escape. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each image (grave, scroll, footprints) layers density until the final reconfiguration. One seamless transition (cabin → moonlit snow) keeps orientation legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ranger cabin, mountain wind, and snow form a micro-setting that constrains choice: the stove’s sparks become words she can no longer use, the snow erases the scroll. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the final stone on blank bark crystallizes the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to chronicle when the dreamer is also the dream—tightens via the scroll’s instruction not to land. Pressure escalates through accumulating images (grave, footprints, vanishing ink) rather than causal reversals; the cost is the scroll’s erasure and her acceptance of endless recursion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: narrative as erosion, memory as mineral. The final image of snow dissolving the scroll reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—placing the stone on emptiness—carries the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and pressure-matched: “jaded wonder rattling in her ribs,” “feral nostalgia bite.” Perceptual signature is consistent; the mountain’s indifference filters every observation. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“snowflakes like white ink”). Occasional elevated diction (“chronologically confused”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream archivist whose own death is archived—feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of nostalgia from homesickness for place to homesickness for sequence is specific and earned. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
