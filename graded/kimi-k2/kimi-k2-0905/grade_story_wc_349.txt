<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The clean-slate vendor’s choices feel causal—her purchase with absence, the door image, and her last act of letting the outline step through all reconfigure stakes. Still, some motivation remains abstruse; the late reveal of her own door makes her a passenger in the close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A lyrically nested but legible drive (Accumulative/Textural): patterns of absence build until the final book-bottled moonlight and the white-space shore reprice the world. Each shard (vendor, boy, librarian) teaches the rule of quantifying absence by action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard, moonlight bottles, crystal fruit and absences all constrain or charge multiple beats: the vendor’s empty door appears first in reflection, the orchards sag under narrative weight at close. Physical rule-set (“day must incision”) never contradicted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—create absence to map stories—escalates as each sale tips the orchard’s balance and forces the vendor to subtract herself. No external antagonist; pressure coheres under constraining absence instead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of absence becoming the birthplace of stories; no meta commentary, but the final white-space shore makes conceptual cost legible. Motifs (door, bottles) constrain choices rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Venture steps through the outline-door without a single head-hop; tight lyric compression with distinct perceptual signature (“swirling sea of clouds”). Formal elision (moonlight-drunk) is patterned from the first paragraph and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm compressed under lyrical pressure; figurative–first risk paid off. Density is high, but a few forced flourishes (“syllables of forgotten language”) momentarily stall the apple-drop beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transforms the trope of the merchant into a door-shaped absence–creator—specific, non-generic. Synthesizes existing metaphysic imagery through charged particulars rather than gimmickry; however, the concept remains akin to Borgesian tables of absences.</comment>
