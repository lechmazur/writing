<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mila’s perceptual specificity and moral arc—from detached noticer to active planter—track cleanly, but interiority occasionally drifts into thematic mouthpiece rather than embodied choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Causal chain from first vanished shop to final mosaics re-appearing is tight: each plant site resurrects memory with concrete, escalating stakes and earned climax in the palace stones.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Palace courtyard and breadcrust-decor seedlings anchor both micro-setting and symbol, charging the final image; gods through roses offer literal and narrative constraint alike.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Memory erasure versus cultivation produces one deepening beat per plant; each burial tightens stakes until the last crust plants absolution into the city’s forgetting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of everyday resurrection germinates through beats rather than preaching; final garden-kept confessions turn abstract guilt into tactile stewardship without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct, soil-stained gardener syntax and Mila’s wary observational lens hold; occasional poetic chorus voice flirts with excess yet never drowns the ground-level cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic compression and line propulsion under moon-light planting are strong; scattered aphoristic flourishes (“flour ghosts,” “guilt rises like yeast”) risk overwriting yet resolve in final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Guerrilla gardening as absolution ritual is fresh; archetype familiarity (baker) is transformed through specific lived ritual rather than novelty flourish alone.</comment>
