<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mila’s vocation and perceptual quirks are vivid, but the interior contradiction between fear of complicity and hunger for restoration stays summary; the final “tears salting the crust” lands because prior tactile care with the loaf earned it, yet the gardener remains a functional oracle rather than a second pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the reopened bakery and commuter benches reweight the premise, proving absolution is cultivated, not granted; causal chain (find loaf → bury → shoots → memory leaks → shop reopens) holds under Accumulative lens, with persistent constraint that scrutiny kills the spell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flour ghosts, breadcrust “name-tags,” and vines threading mosaic gods are selective, pressure-responsive details; the tea-house micro-setting supplies the crucial resource (gardener + permission), and the evolving herb-text on asphalt directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the city forget forever?—tightens when each buried slice risks sealing amnesia if mishandled; the fourth-site micro-turn (“tasted crumbs… sacred in the ordinary”) escalates via pattern break, forcing Mila to accept continuous cultivation as cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of continuous, ordinary resurrection emerges through loaf → seed → herb → reopened bakery without sermon; final image of shoots “spelling names of bakeries yet to vanish” offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights earlier flour ghosts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, slightly mythic diction stays stable inside Mila’s perceptual bias; “heuristically gentle” and “flour ghosts” are idiosyncratic yet legible; no head-hop, and compression (“tea-steam sighs”) serves emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene pressure; sentences carry double duty (action + image); only minor scaffold (“each time… each time”) and one near-mixed metaphor (“guilt rises like yeast; plant it”) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Guerrilla gardening a memory-loaf into asphalt to resurrect erased bakeries is a fresh synthesis; the inversion of relic into seed feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric ellipsis, mosaic pacing) heightens meaning without obscuring closure.</comment>
