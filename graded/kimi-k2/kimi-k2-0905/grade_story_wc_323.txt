<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Instructor’s grief-anchored need to keep possibility alive drives every beat; the boy’s trembling question and subsequent bloodied fingers make his stake tactile. Interiority stays concrete via the rusted link pressed to stone and the hollow in her pocket. The final transfer of the link to the boy crystallizes a credible, costly endurance—she relinquishes her last private compass—earning the closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the instructor’s missing-link void becomes a “navigable absence,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Causality holds—each beat (link grinding, shell-chart drawing, boy’s sighting) accumulates toward that final image. Orientation is swift: benthic city, amphitheater, spire all anchored within 120 words. No lens ambiguity; pattern of metallic edges ↔ folded starlight taught early and confirmed by leviathan passage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: water pressure dictates muffled speech, bioluminescent plankton provides the only “starlight,” cracked lighthouse spire becomes sextant mount. Coral-wrapped towers and alien sonic murals are filtered through the instructor’s professional gaze, never tourist catalog. The metallic bevel of the link catching blue glow is the micro-setting beat that charges the final image—its absence leaves a perfect void that literally reorients navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep navigation possible after stars wander—tightens once: from communal lesson to solo watch as the boy sights an unnamed fixed point. Instructor’s relinquishment of the link is the visible price that forecloses her own return. Pressure stays accumulative: each geometric tracing adds density until the leviathan’s angle-match confirms method. Cost is legible on-page—“missing link left a hollow that ached like lungs remembering air.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: navigation as refusal to disappear. No moralizing—final line “direction begins where fear ends” is image-anchored by the hollow pocket. Recurring link evolves from relic to sextant to absent void, reweighting meaning without forced motif. Somber marvel tone sustains ambiguity—hope is possible yet unguaranteed—leaving resonant aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to instructor’s perceptual filter: “balancedly curious gaze,” “voice muffled by water and grief.” Syntax lengthens underwater—“slow planet,” “spirals of silent light”—then compresses at peak: “Then the horizon has unfolded for you.” No head-hopping; boy’s interior accessed only through observable tremor and whisper. Distinct idiom maintained; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—“east a knife” is single sharp metaphor that charges closure. Rhythm varies: long aquatic clauses drift, final paragraph clipped to mimic dawn filtration. No mixed metaphors, no filler stacks; high information density with clear propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of submarine survival, alien folded space, and maritime relic feels inevitable yet fresh. Edge geometry as literal navigation method transforms familiar “stars go wrong” trope into tactile practice. Risky lyric compression pays off: hollow pocket = navigable void. Specificity throughout—sonic murals, shell-chart, rusted bevel—prevents generic swap.</comment>
