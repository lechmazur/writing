<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lucien’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“ink-stained fingers,” “parchment-like skin”), but the reversal sequence is narrated more than dramatized; the final choice to “letter…with questions” is earned yet feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete, felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lucien’s forward-speaking vow reconfigures his stance and forecloses the earlier refusal; the reversal gimmick is taught early and paid off. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of smoke-puppets reweights meaning with visible cost (burned fingers).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dome’s broken panels and ghost receivers are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Lucien’s psyche; the stick and ashes become micro-setting that constrain the final act of writing. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (humming) and touch (char, ash) over tourist visuals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to ethically wield art—tightens through the reversal ritual; the tightening is one deepening rather than multiple reversals, but the cost (pain, ash-ink) is legible and reweights options at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: ethical storytelling as holding unresolved tension. The smoke-puppets’ dissolution into stardust offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Voice is urbane yet tactile, with rhythmic control (“meteor hush,” “charred tip whispering”). Compression and lyric patterning are taught early; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Lucien’s lexicon; final line crystallizes stance without voice slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“equations of regret,” “ether between frequencies”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean. Final image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher + decommissioned dome + mythic reversal stick. The reversal-as-revelation rather than erasure feels inevitable. Risk in lyric non-linear structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
