<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coachman’s interior contradiction—ferrying weapons yet yearning to seed peace—surfaces only in the final third; earlier he is a cipher. His single decisive micro-choice (scattering the “forgive” pod) is embodied and costly, tongue bleeding, but the shift from war-carrier to gardener is not foreshadowed by prior on-page beats, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard adds density until the final chord reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—gloom-hill coachman, blooming jetty, twilight—yet the closure image (lantern-petals guiding dead soldiers) delivers undeniable conceptual cost: the battlefield is literally erased by garden. One transition (jetty edge → water) is legible; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jetty’s planks-turned-soil, the cedar box, and the rust-feather function as micro-settings that constrain every action; the box literally limits which word-seed can be spoken. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—coral dust, myrrh-gunpowder smoke, salt-tasting flowers—culminating in the glowing kelp-like grove that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the battlefield keep bleeding or be gardened—is signaled in paragraph five and tightened when the “forgive” pod is spent, foreclosing further speech. Cost is visible (tongue blood, empty box) and alters tactics: carriage will never carry weapons again. Pressure accumulates via floral encroachment rather than causal reversals, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-through-language emerges from the seed-words, bird-bones, and final lantern-petals; no character states it. The submerged concord’s chord reweights all prior violence without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: peace is planted but not guaranteed, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to the coachman’s perceptual filter—drowned-trumpet trill, salt-tasting petals—while syntax lengthens and compresses with emotional surge. No head-hopping; dead-language lexicon is voice-motivated and consistent. Rhythm crests at the scattering beat, then exhales cleanly into the final “begin.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety and muscular verbs carry dense metaphor without purple drift; only minor scaffold (“He…, then he…”) in mid-section. Figurative logic stays coherent—metal flowers, tongue blood—culminating in the unmixed image of petals-as-lanterns. No loops or register drift touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The seed-as-unpronounceable-word, bird-bone treaty, and battlefield-grove synthesis feel inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when the concord’s chord literally blooms from bayonets. Transformation is total: swap any detail and the emotional algebra collapses.</comment>
