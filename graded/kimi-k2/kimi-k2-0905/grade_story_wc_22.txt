<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s grief-rooted motive and ritualized action are embodied and consistent; the micro-choice to accept the rusted button crystallizes his stance. Interiority is rich yet avoids label-speak. The Earned Stasis—leaving without home—carries visible cost, though the interior contradiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widening “narrow vastness” reconfigures meaning while the reef-garden takes hold. Causal chain—seed → acceptance → root through plank—is legible and irreversible. Orientation is anchored by coral dust and tern cries within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jetty’s bullet-hole morning-glories and submerged concord function as micro-setting that constrains every beat; the final phosphorescent garden charges the image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, tactile, and purposeful. Environment evolves causally with each seed-scatter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with vegetation—tightens through each fertilizing beat; the terns’ warning escalates pressure. Agency is ritual yet decisive; the cost is the unending itinerancy. One deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration-through-memory emerges from concrete particulars: seeds metabolizing gunpowder, bees pronouncing fallen names. Final image of glowing flowers offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in tern-given button and rusted uniform is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every image through a mourner-linguist’s ear. Syntax modulates with ritual cadence, then tightens at climax. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Non-standard idiom (“pre-war merfolk idiom”) is taught and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence layers image, memory, and motion. Metaphors are coherent—coral dust once alive, moon-moth wings in seed. No loops or scaffold. Minor risk of overwriting is held in check by ritual pacing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-war reef-garden premise is fresh; transformation of battle detritus into living flora feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of dead-language lullabies and tern dialects anchors universals. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
