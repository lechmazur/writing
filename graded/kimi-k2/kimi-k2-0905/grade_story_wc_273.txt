<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s grief-driven fixation is vivid, but interiority occasionally abstracts into theme-speak (“serene anger”) rather than embodied reaction. The decision to step into ink is earned yet skims the deeper cost this length could force. Secondary figures read more as echo than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: Lyra’s vanishing → ink map → portal → temporal fold, each turn narrowing possibility. The ink-drop inciting incident anchors time-scratch and payoff. One minor orientation bump—how Kael instantly reads an hourglass-shattered portal—rattles but is waived by closure utility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sandstone heat vs eclipse chill create textured sensory poles; the ink on stone fractals become a literal map. Micro-setting advantage: time bends tactilely on one sandstone slab. Fails tight 9+ gate—ink vs wall interaction doesn’t narrow tactics; it merely stages spectacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save sister within a folding desert—tightens decisively each beat. Ink choices cost the last vial, foreclosing retreat. Escalation trades speed for duration; the slower heartbeats crystallize stakes perfectly under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Themes of stretched time and wild surrender emerge from action, never sermon. Lyra’s journal quote is an earned insight reweighting perception. Closure image of siblings diving “between heartbeats” offers poetic CR without tidy moral.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable in Kael’s heightened, obsessive filter. Lyric compression (“pink eyes narrowing”) keeps lyric without head-hopping. Once drone becomes alarmed, narrative leaks meta-guilt (“metallic mind recoil”)—minor slip, forgivable at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is muscular when action demands, metaphoric when temp distorts—“ink evaporate faster” under drone wings. Minor synonym stack “consciously wild” repeats across beats (−0.2). Still drives propulsion; no loops obscure causality.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Unusual fusion: vanishing-ink-as-portal plus eclipse-temporal-fold synthesizes genre tropes into fresh desert magic. Specific personal stakes (sister, mother) nail the conceit beyond abstract novelty. Risky lyric open ending earns its quiet reconfiguration.</comment>
