<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Albino tracker Kael's pink-eye gaze and "serene anger" create a lucid interior signature; his step into the ink portal finalizes a renunciation we've been prepped for (sister, mother, vocation). Interiority is embodied ("gloved finger," glow of skin), but sister Lyra remains schematic—only bootprints and oracle voice—so relationships stay more imagined than dramatic. Micro-choices (three ink drops, release of the vial) carry visible cost, though several rhetorical reaches ("consciously wild" twice) dilute specificity. Endure-and-enter is a credible, earned posture; the price is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single scene, tight causal chain: bootprint → drone → ink → portal → choice. Orientation anchored in two lines ("wind-carved encampment," sandstone warmth); transitions are legible via drone flight. Closure is a Decisive Change (vanishing) whose cost is concrete: forfeiture of the known world. One brief expository paragraph near climax ("it’s a defense mechanism...") risks over-explaining but adheres to the 20 % backstory limit. Lens remains causal throughout: each beat advances goal and raises stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sandstone walls, ink absorbing, drone wings “creating their own wind” all pressure options—thirst, heat, evaporation dictate timing. Hourglass-ink symbol constrains the culminating doorway; micro-setting becomes the tool itself. Vivid heat and light render the eclipse-afterglow tapestry of crisis. Spatial choreography holds: distances from bootprint to well to portal cleanly placed on one sandstone plane without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find Lyra and understand the time dilation—clear from first glance at the print. Tightening occurs when drone recoil and shadow-stretch signal encroaching temporal fold. Agency: Kael chooses disappearance after seeing the ink-circle “perfect.” Mislabel moment: “defense mechanism” prose risks letting idea solve problem, yet the pivot lands on felt personal surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—“time slows to gift the seconds needed to choose”—is never declared but accretes through bootprint duration, ink evaporation, eclipse pause. Final ink map revalues every prior vanishing as voluntary pilgrimage. Subtextual silence of mother and sister holds the ache that drives Kael; refusal to moralize keeps complexity alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Single POV held; lyrical compression ("wind-carved encampment lay silent") already teaches denser cadence. Kael’s perception skews virulent light, translucent skin, confined vision—heightened, character-specific. Drone’s recoil adds a shiver of artificial fear without POV leakage. Minor register wobble in “like waking from a dream” cliché barely tugs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Percussion variation: short pistol sentences at crisis long glides in lull. Density high—single sentences often serve three jobs (atmosphere, plot, interiority). Zero loops, intrusive filter verbs, or purple obstructive prose. Indelicate re-use of “consciously wild” twice keeps it shy of 9.0 but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Temporal origami, ink-alchemy portal, and desert as sentient entity weave a fresh constellation; echoes of Dune are overwritten by intimate family tragedy. Risk: embracing quantum metaphor without hand-wringing explanation. Specificity—three drops of mother-ink, albino skin catching lunar light—anchors speculative flight in lived detail. Optional +0.3 for daring temporal logic that still ends with a pulse of human cost.</comment>
