<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alder’s grief-driven choices (melting the coin, kintsugi-ing the mirror) are embodied and irreversible; the internal contradiction—love vs. guilt—drives every beat. The final renunciation (slipping the silver tube into the downspout) costs him any further claim to her name, earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored image of the daughter fractures and is gilded, reweighting the premise that wounds can become lanterns. Causal chain—coin → mirror → tube → river—holds without gaps; the cost (permanent surrender of the name) is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is not backdrop; its cracked beams, slag yard, and forge constrain every action and supply the crucible, cooling floor, and downspout that enable the ritual. Weather and architecture evolve with the scene, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Alder redeem the weight of his daughter’s vanished name?—tightens once: from possession (coin) to reflection (mirror) to surrender (tube). Each step narrows options and exacts visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the kintsugi conceit: brokenness gilded becomes strength. The final image of the river carrying silvered names downstream offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with metallic, alchemical diction and rhythmic control that modulates with pressure (“blood-colored glow,” “luminous regret”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Alder’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off (luminous regret, kintsugi seams). No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere. One hairline slip—“factually mystical pulse”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, and filial grief; the conceit that a name can be minted, mirrored, then surrendered feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
