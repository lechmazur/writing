<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and drive are embodied in concrete micro-choices—tracing the pendant, sampling footprints, mapping the pilgrimage—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“understood then,” “refused to accept”) rather than live contradiction. The final resolve to warn the city is earned, but the emotional cost is stated more than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each beat layers evidence of harvesting wonder until the final crystallization that “they were collecting the chemistry of homecoming.” Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Mara leaves the garden with knowledge that reweights every prior contact—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-washed tower, bronze statues, and sculpture path are vividly filtered through Mara’s scientific gaze; the amber pendant and electromagnetic spikes from the statue constrain her choices in-scene. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting quietly mirrors the erosion of memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether humanity’s longing is being weaponized—tightens as Mara deciphers the footprint compounds and the statue’s hollow resonance. One clear deepening: realizing the pilgrimage is a harvest, not a gift. The cost is intellectual rather than visceral, keeping it below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of commodified belonging emerges organically from the pilgrimage pattern and Mara’s scientific dissection of wonder. The final image—her footprints joining the constellation—offers a resonant, non-moralizing reweighting of “home” as something stolen, not found.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a precise, slightly clinical diction that suits a skeptical scientist. Occasional lyrical lifts (“bronze quiet,” “chemistry of homecoming”) feel earned rather than ornamental. No dialogue appears, so voice is judged solely on narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor loop risk in repeated “bronze quiet” and “chemistry of homecoming,” but each recurrence gains new weight. No line-level artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The “harvesting wonder” premise reframes first-contact tropes through the lens of emotional extraction, avoiding stock invasion beats. Specific details—amber pendant, electromagnetic statue—ground the concept in tactile reality, making the speculative feel inevitable.</comment>
