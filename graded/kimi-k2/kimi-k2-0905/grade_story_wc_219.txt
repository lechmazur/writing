<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical drive is embodied in every micro-choice—pressing the amber to the statue, inhaling the spores, planting the empty shard—each action a deliberate experiment that costs her the very nostalgia she dissects. Interiority is precise, never therapeutic: “I am here to prove that return is a reaction, not a reunion.” The final renunciation—walking away as footprints erase—earns its sting through prior causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tower exhales itself out of existence, reweighting “home” from reunion to irreversible chemical decay. Causal lattice holds—each amber pulse, water drop, and spore inhalation tightens options until the only path left is erasure. Cost is legible in the dissolving footprints and the empty amber planted like a seed of future fossilized loss.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The rainwashed tower, moss-softened earth, and lichen-scented stairwell are not backdrop but reagents; their wet mineral breath accelerates the amber’s reaction and the tower’s gentle collapse. Micro-setting—the bronze statue’s eroded chest—literally hosts the catalytic beat. Final image of buried amber fuses setting and theme into one geological memory.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—proving homecoming is chemistry, not reunion—tightens with each artifact: the amber map, the failed sculptures, the tower’s lung-like collapse. Agency is expressed through hypothesis and deliberate inhalation of spores, not combat. The decisive tightening occurs when the fly dissolves and the tower folds, foreclosing any return with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: belonging is a fossilized reaction, nostalgia a radioactive isotope. Subtext pulses in the amber’s shadows—extinction replayed on the dome walls—and in the almond-cyanotype scent of Mara’s mother’s cut. Final image of empty amber planted in soil offers a resonant, non-moral answer: memory will fossilize again, but never as home.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, skeptical, and lyrically compressed: “the tower began to collapse inward, not violently, but gently—like a lung exhaling its last.” Perceptual signature is scientist-poet, noticing chemical signatures and geological time in the same breath. No head-hopping; every metaphor is earned by the POV’s trained attention.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is spare yet sonorous, each sentence a precise titration of image and idea. No loops or scaffold; “dusty footprints remained on the overgrown sculpture path” carries triple duty—setting, stakes, and elegy. Rhythm accelerates down the dissolving staircase, then stills into the final planting beat with perfect cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “first-contact gift” trope into a geochemical elegy; the amber is not a map but a catalyst for self-erasure. Synthesis feels inevitable: offworlder nostalgia and human grief crystallize into a single fossil. Risk—letting the tower evaporate rather than explode—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
