<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timekeeper’s interiority is vivid—his tactile rubbing of the urn shard, the taste of “iron like blood from a bitten minute”—but his choices remain largely observational. The final exchange of the shard for a snow globe is a micro-choice that crystallizes his shift from collector to participant, yet the cost feels gentle rather than irreversible. Relationships are absent, so the crucible is internal; the arc is credible but not searing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the timekeeper renounces measurement for narrative exchange, and the cost is the loss of his last numbered relic. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each price-tag description thickens the texture of time—until the final image reweights the premise. One minor drift: the boy’s sudden appearance is convenient, not earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is tactile—rusted gauge, internal ladder rungs “like sentences”—and the spilled time-capsule detritus grounds the surreal premise. The urn fragment and price tags act as micro-settings that constrain choice: he pockets, arranges, and finally trades them. Light “neither gold nor amber” charges the final image, making setting inseparable from theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: to rediscover what time feels like when numbers fail. Pressure tightens as each price tag offers a new texture of memory; the final trade narrows his options from collector to participant. The cost—relinquishing the urn shard—lands on the page, though the escalation is more accumulative than sharply rising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: time is not measured but exchanged through story. The price-tag descriptions smuggle memory into commerce, and the final “genuine shiver” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the shard’s “echo of last exhalation,” a quiet indictment of commodified grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“polite graffiti on the rusted loading gauge,” “time passing was granular, a fine metallic dust.” POV remains tightly interior; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (“numbers changed meaning”) and paid off in the final taste of iron. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“green wheat like an unabridged novel”—without purple overload. One paraphrase loop (“time passing was granular… fine metallic dust”) is minor. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the final paragraph slows to crystallize the reconfiguration. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit—time as garage-sale narrative currency—is fresh, yet grounded in the mundane act of labeling household junk. Transformation test: swap the silo for any other ruin and the emotional arc collapses. Risk is taken and rewarded; the shard’s cracked glaze and the boy’s shouted “nothing priced!” feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
