<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction pulses in the cracked seam of the baseball—”orbited him, lunar and loyal” yet bearing futures he spurned. The step into the bioluminescent lake is a micro-choice that fissures him, not a tidy atonement. Voice and motive stay specific: the “metallic taste of victories that fed no one” is embodied, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mosaic Track cleanly taught; each shard (ward, drains, lake) hands off to the next with causal logic—newspaper ink → coordinates → lake bargain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): empathy not as absolution but as ongoing circuitry. Cost is visible: “the lake became a circuit, pain circulating.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Concrete geography anchors by paragraph three (“storm drains”, “living rock veined with bacteria”) and tracks cleanly through every move. The lake’s luminous water constrains the final choice (stepping into cold fire), charging the ending image. Scale fits 800 words; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (consent to fracture) signaled from the first paragraph and narrows to one irreversible choice in the lake. One mid-story deepening—newspaper coordinates—tightens tactics without extra reversals. Price is felt: “unfiltered guilt” traded for endless “circuit of pain.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy as electrical circuit emerges solely through image—bioluminescence under skin, ticket stubs from tomorrow—not assertion. Subtext lives in the baseball’s seam split. Refuses tidy moral, ends on “ladder unending.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lush but never purple: “glowed like bottled auroras, silence felt wet against the skin.” Rhythm breathes with beats; short declarative sentences surface at the plunge (“When the water reached his heart”). Narrative distance stays close to seeker’s nerves throughout mosaic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Information-dense: every sentence doubles duty (“obituaries bled ink that spelled coordinates”). Metaphors disciplined to concrete physical verbs (“soldered its halves with silver”). No scaffold or loops; slight over-description in lake paragraph stays controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Freshens the amnesia-redemption archetype into biological reciprocity—memory as bacterial luminous infection rather than gift. “Ticket stubs dated tomorrow” re-stitches time-travel rule set. Transformation test passes: could only occur with baseball signed in future-self loop.</question>
