<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s “fiercely gentle” contradiction is dramatized in every gesture; the narrator’s surrender of the humming memory is embodied, costly, and irreversible. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final stance—holes left open for light—earns its renunciation through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s ledger reweights the premise, cost is legible in the sprout’s faint hum. Causal chain holds—tarot tear → memory transfer → Lira’s sag → sprout—without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop; root-cradled skulls and candle-drowned wax constrain exit timing and charge the final image. Sensory selection narrows under urgency. Micro-setting (gatekeeper’s skull) becomes the sprout’s cradle, reconfiguring meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trading memory for soul-repair—is signaled early and tightened when the mother’s hum is exacted. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible in Lira’s hollowed eyes and the orchard’s unbalanced ledger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s reciprocal wounds: patching one soul puckers another. Final image of star-shaped sprout humming lost memory offers non-literal answer—holes must remain for light—without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture and root-bone tableau.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is textured, rhythmic, and biased toward tactile detail; “dusky resolve” modulates with pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at surrender. Dialogue sparse but subtextual: “Every scar is a door.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“orchard breathed damp earth”). No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tarot and underworld tropes are transformed through bone-orchard ecology and memory-as-currency. The star-sprout reprise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky structure—lyric mosaic—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
