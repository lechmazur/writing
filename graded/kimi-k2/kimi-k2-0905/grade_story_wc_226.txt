<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus defiance—are embodied in the mirror-shard ritual; the final acceptance of cost (“I accept the cost”) is earned by prior causality and visibly paid when the spire cracks and yields the feather.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the split spire and feather crystallize a before/after shift; the causal lens holds—each poetic line tightens options until the decisive listening beat reframes the entire conflict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The canyon, bone towers, and spire constrain every tactical choice; the mirror shard acts as micro-setting that literally refracts the stakes; the final feather emerges from the spire’s fissure, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—refracting guilt to diffuse blame—tightens with each echoed syllable; the cost is made visceral when the spire cracks and Lira forfeits her solitary claim to the truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Forgiveness as a two-faced coin emerges organically from the refracted echoes; the final feather offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights guilt into shared story without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric voice—compressed, sensory, mythic—remains consistent; perceptual signature (“wind sounded like held breath”) is character-bound; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density, propulsive lines (“bone vibrating like a plucked wire”) advance stakes; zero loops or scaffold; metaphors remain coherent under pressure; final image is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: portraitist using bone-spire as prism to fracture guilt into communal echo; the risk of poetry-as-ritual pays off in a closure that feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
