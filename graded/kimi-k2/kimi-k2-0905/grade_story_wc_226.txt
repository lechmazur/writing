<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s guilt-driven compulsion is stark, but the interiority slips into lyrical self-diagnosis (“truth echoed in her ribs louder…”) and the choice to listen rather than speak, though costly, is told more than dramatized, muting the internal contradiction. The feather acceptance is vivid embodiment, yet it feels slightly gifted, not clawed for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is coherent: exile propels, spire ritual required → attempts refraction → silence/listening becomes the pivotal turn, culminating in cracked bone and dawn escape. Closure lands clearly via Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance shifts from projecting guilt to bearing it—yet the cost feels feather-light and briefly stated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is sensorily rich and selective; the canyon’s sonic architecture—bone towers, humming sockets, spire’s thermal pulse—functions as crucible, concretely shaping the refracting test. Spatial choreography is clean; the spire’s fissure and floating feather serve as charged environmental punctuation at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Central stake (shifting blame into shared burden) is declared early and tightened when “listening” replaces recitation; the cost emerges when prior echoes are absorbed. Escalation is lyrical, not tangible; a harder punch of consequence would sharpen the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The refracted guilt motif threads image, sound, and motion without explicit moral; the final “story learning to breathe” reweights the quest non-literally. However, the queen’s forgiveness plea is spoken aloud so multiply it borders on statement; more residue of subtext would linger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose texture is distinctive—compressed, rhythmic, perceptually precise (apricot-stealing mischief tone, bone spire as “needle stitching sky to stone”). Occasional ornate flourishes (“white light through a prism”) verge on precious but remain voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density sentences perform double duty; a few metaphors (“hollow sockets humming with memory”) risk overload yet read aloud smoothly. Minimal loops; the spire-canyon lexicon remains anchored. Final cadence line is clean echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The canyon-of-forgiveness refracted by poetry is a fresh synthesis of familiar mythic territory; risk in the abstract ritual pays off because the specific sensory mechanics (mirror shard, vibrating bone, feather) ground the concept. Slight echoes of Borges and Le Guin remain, but are sublimated through lived texture.</comment>
