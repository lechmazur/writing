<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ember’s pyromania-as-revelation arc is embodied in tactile choices (tracing soot, pressing warm fragment), but the grandmother’s deathbed whisper is summary, not dramatized pressure. Interior contradiction flickers (“destruction’s dual nature”) yet never forces a costly micro-choice on the page. Final self-redefinition lands with felt cost—she emerges “keeper of a truth”—but the absence of live opposition keeps the crucible cool.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: archive collapses behind her, purpose fulfilled, identity reforged. Causal chain (artistic trail → tapestry → self-portrait map) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sketch’s chemical coordinates pay off in the glowing reweave. One transition—descent/ascent—remains spatially legible. Cost is visible: she loses the archive but gains irreversible knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lost archive is evoked through scent (parchment, lavender-sulfur perfume) and touch (warm threads), anchoring POV inside body. Micro-setting of tapestry niche behind false wall constrains the final discovery. Spatial choreography is coherent—fingers trace walls, locate fragment, climb out—no floating rooms. Environment collapses causally behind her, charging the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise—tightens when tapestry reveals grandmother’s torch-of-knowledge, forcing Ember to accept her role as keeper. Escalation is textural: each burned sketch layers meaning until the map completes. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and ancestral. Final cost: she must let the archive burn again to preserve truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme—destruction as purification—emerges through the tapestry’s reweaving, not statement. Subtext lives in the scratched-out eyes that “follow her,” implying surveillance by the past. Final image of keeper-with-torch reweights all prior arsons as acts of preservation. Resonant ambiguity: some knowledge must be burned clean, yet the cost is hers alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, volcanic, and consistent: “volcanic tenderness” modulates from destructive heat to preserving warmth. Sensory diction (“soot-stained,” “lavender and sulfur”) is POV-bound. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Patterned repetition of “volcanic tenderness” is taught early and recharged at closure without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors (“torch that burned with knowledge”) remain coherent. Minor loop: “volcanic tenderness” appears three times but serves cadence. No scaffolding or synonym churn. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Arsonist-as-archivist flips the trope; burning libraries to save truth feels fresh and inevitable. Artistic-trail cipher using chemical heat is specific and non-obvious. Grandmother’s tapestry reweaving is a charged callback that reframes every prior fire. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
