<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jules’ reckless-explorer identity is shown through the single choice to enter the sealed factory, but the interiority stays lyrically general (“reckless… drowsy alertness”) rather than revealing a contradictory hierarchy of values under pressure; the final cost (beads clicking in his ribs) is felt, yet the turn from skeptical observer to ritual weigher of souls is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the 1,887-lb truth is transferred from the dead to the narrator’s lungs, a cost made legible in the final image; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bead added thickens atmospheric density until the wheel becomes weightless and the bulb bursts—without causality breaks; orientation is taught early through the tunnel mouth and radio cue, so no penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting: its rosary-bead sequence physically constrains the narrator’s decoding action and is recharged in the closing image of beads clicking against ribs; tunnel coal dust, creosote stink, and the green bulb’s sickly pulse are filtered through a skeptical industrial sensibility, guiding the final ritual act with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the weight of what we swallowed”—tightens when each bead added compresses the air and translucent workers appear; the narrator’s agency to keep loading beads despite rising dread visibly forecloses the option of walking away, paying the cost of internalizing 1,887 lbs of reckoning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of industrial sin made literal emerges through coolant mist ingested as “body of industry” and the ledger’s net-weight entry; the final transference avoids moralizing, instead reconfiguring the moral calculus so the living lungs now carry the workers’ unabsolved mass—an image that reverberates without tidy thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice maintains a skeptical mill-explorer idiom—“religiously skeptical iron,” “diesel-pink light”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates under pressure; no head-hopping, and the delayed radio echo of the narrator’s own voice is handled as externalized phenomena rather than omniscient intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propel information without scaffold, and avoid mixed metaphor; occasional lyric stacking (“coal dust communion wafers”) is purposeful and pattern-taught, never obscuring causality; no loops or filter-verb clusters appear in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The industrial-purgatory conceit fuses ghost-shift folklore with hydraulic Catholic guilt, transforming the trope into a physical weighing ritual; the valve-rosary is a fresh synthesizing object whose bead-count literally tallies the dead, making the final transference feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
