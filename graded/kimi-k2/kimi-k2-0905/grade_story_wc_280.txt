<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ghost’s craving for an encore is embodied in every beat—his walk, coin press, thread tying—so motivation stays visceral. Interiority is ghost-specific (translucent ribs, frost soles) and never generic. The final bow under leaf-applause crystallizes an earned stasis: he accepts endless invisibility as cost for endless possibility. Only a hairline slip: Lila’s flicker between ages is slightly abstract, not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard folds 1923 and now into a continuous present, sealing the ghost’s fate with audible heartbeat-cost. Causal chain—coin → maze → orchard → thread → heartbeat—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift: lobby lights off → velvet curtain → alley hedge within 50 words. No teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Velvet curtain, frost footlights, glowing quince-fruit footlights—each detail constrains the ghost’s movement or charges the final image. The maze’s narrowing yew walls and night-blooming nicotia perfume literally steer him to the marble stage. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. Environment is not backdrop but engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“one more ovation to stitch memory”—is signaled in line 2 and escalates as each echo thickens nostalgia into almost-solid ground. Agency drives escalation: ghost chooses to tie coin to tree, walk stage, accept invisibility. Cost is felt: endless encore without living audience. One tightening turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as sustenance and memory as cage. Subtext lives in gestures: thimble raised like baton, coin warm as living palm. Final image—ghost bowing to leaf-applause—offers non-literal answer: possibility preserved by eternal repetition, despair held at bay. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is spectral yet precise: “minutes fracture into colored ribbons—citrine applause, indigo silence.” Synesthetic diction stays ghost-bound. No head-hopping; POV remains inside translucent ribs. Dialogue (only Lila’s two lines) carries trumpet-solo gold spirals—distinct idiom. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical sentences under floral chords, short heartbeat at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “the fractured timeline sealed into a continuous present” compresses decades into one clause. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors (petals returning to bud, chords of perfume) are coherent and pay off. Line-level propulsion mirrors ghost’s drift—no filler, no over-description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Premise—ghost rehearses for an audience of memory inside a synesthetic orchard—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tarot coin, synesthetic seamstress, and folding timeline synthesize into singular vision. Risk: lyric ghost story could collapse into gimmick, but emotional specificity anchors it. No recognizable template echo.</comment>
