<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-driven quest is embodied in every micro-choice—photographing the journal, sealing the dog tags—yet the interior contradiction between clinging and releasing is stated more than dramatized. The final renunciation is earned and costly, but Fred remains an observer, not a crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: grief conserves, only disperses. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of salt-stained books, dissolving ink—culminating in the snow-globe orbit that reweights the premise. One transition (below/above) is legible and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken library’s pressure, salt, and crystallized barnacles constrain every action; the snow globe becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“cathedral of salt-stained books”). Spatial choreography is clean across the companionway ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to let go without betrayal—tightens through each measurement of forgetting. The meaningful deepening is Mara’s decision to release the plane and the dog tags; the cost is the irrevocable dispersal of grief into background hum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the physics of memory and grief: letting go is phase change, not loss. The final image of the orbiting snow-globe planet offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Fred’s hand steadying, not claiming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, analytic, and salt-stained; syntax mirrors the slow tidal rhythm. Compression (“quietly analytic to the end”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “ink had bled then faded, how stories had learned to breathe water.” No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere. Sentence rhythm accelerates with ascent, then exhales in the final line. Zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing Earhart lore, thermodynamics of memory, and a sentient Death named Fred is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The sunken library as a cathedral of forgetting feels freshly specific. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
