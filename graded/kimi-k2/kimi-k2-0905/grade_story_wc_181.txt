<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—hunger for knowledge vs. dread of entrapment—are embodied in the cheek-held shell and the burn pile; her final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority is vivid and specific (“smooth impossible nut”). Only minor drift: the bathroom epiphanies risk tidy packaging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive renunciation (Earned Stasis): the uncarved shell dissolved, Quell’s memories burned, new buds bearing Lira’s own face. Causal chain from stall note → staircase → chamber → choice is tight; the orchard’s plumbing rule is taught early and paid off. Cost is legible in the salt-sweet aftertaste and the blank index.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: the translucent outhouse walls and spiral staircase of light constrain access; the burning orchard reconfigures the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; nebulae walls and optic-fiber roots are vivid without clutter. The orchard itself becomes the crucible that forces the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—inherit knowledge or remain linear—is signaled early and tightens when Quell’s projection offers the loophole. Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency: she asks, descends, weighs, then refuses. The burn pile is a visible price that alters the orchard’s future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance as both gift and prison emerges from the shell, the burning memories, and the new buds; no moralizing. The final image—orchard blooming with possible selves—reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in Quell’s “vessel and waste” line resonates without explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is curator-astral (“starlight-dappled petals that hummed like tuning forks”). Compression is taught early (“simply complicated, like a Möbius strip”) and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Lira.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “bathroom breakthroughs” refrain, but each iteration adds pressure. No mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with scene needs. Final paragraph is crystalline.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: astral orchard + bathroom philosophy + pistachio shell as genetic USB. The orchard’s memory-fruit and nonlinear ink are specific inventions, not ornament. Risky structure (toilet stall as portal) is earned and coherent. Transformation test passed: story collapses if shell or orchard is swapped.</comment>
