<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mireya’s contradictory impulses—duty to the Council vs. empathy for the Gardeners—are dramatized in every beat; the final compromise is earned through the chain’s re-calibration and Corin’s trust, costing her absolute safety and absolute control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each micro-choice (measuring with the chain, scraping adhesive, inviting Corin) tightens options until the gate’s 70/30 calibration crystallizes; closure is a Charged Poise that forecloses both extremes with visible social risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The volcano’s breathing ribs, tilted marble seats, and lantern-lit basalt constrain movement and mood; the surveyor’s chain doubles as micro-setting, its brass links literally guiding the gate angle—environment and tool fuse to shape the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—valley safety vs. soil renewal—escalates through each thermal sigh and sabotage threat; the 70/30 aperture is a decisive, costly trade-off that narrows all futures to a single, trembling equilibrium.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Encrypted compassion” emerges through action: the chain’s history, the adhesive’s spectral data, and the shared tremble reweight the premise—compassion decoded not as sentiment but as calibrated risk, resonant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, volcanic, and precise—“slyly heartfelt,” “metal sash,” “questioning eyebrow”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under sulfuric pressure; no head-hopping, and Corin’s diction stays distinct in whispered brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: every sentence layers measurement, myth, and heat; metaphors (chain as bridge, magma heartbeat) stay coherent and purposeful, propelling toward the held-note gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Floodgate machinist negotiating lava irrigation via antique chain and envelope adhesive is a fresh synthesis; the 70/30 compromise feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming both safety-engineer and gardener archetypes.</comment>
