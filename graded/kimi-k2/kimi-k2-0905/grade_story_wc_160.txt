<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mireya’s interiority is particular and embodied; her chain as heirloom signals ethics, and her song as method makes the harmony-tactic feel earned rather than ironic. Small slip: “mountain sighed—with” leans poetic without immediate tie to POV sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivated causality: adhesive lattice → coordinates → lullaby → dispute resolution follows because/therefore chain. Mosaic arc respects track-B: seed, development, payoff all clear. Closure unit earns Charged Poise as the volcano’s compulsion effects resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (orchestra floor, keystone, socket) constrains spatial choices; volcano breathing body-as-setting returns in final image. idiom/phrasing always filtered through Mireya’s trade vocabulary; no static travelogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: toggle valley fates via floodgates. Escalation tightens as rhythm is matched to moonrise/moonset cycle; choice forces compromise with visible ecological cost built into ritual rather than off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Encrypted compassion emerges as mediator role rather than adornment; lullaby harmonies compel empathy without sermonizing. Reframes conflict from zero-sum to shared rhythm, subtext rich.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Aware, lyrical voice grounded in Mireya’s perception: brass links tremble, “mountain breathes,” distinct timbre; mountain/river personification never slips out of POV; cadence modulates under peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control under pressure—sentence length inhales with lullaby breath, exhales with gate shift. Zero loops; density high even in descriptive lines. Minor surplus ONE “silver coins of light” cribbed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: adhesive micro-analysis unlocks acoustic mediation—concept feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk elevated without breaking clarity; final image reframes human dispute as harmony under volcano breath.</comment>
