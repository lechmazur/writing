<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth yet fearing its cost—are embodied in her tactile handling of the sundial and the journals; her final resolve to dismantle lies is earned through prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (abandoning the sundial, embracing lifelong labor). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only minor slip: Captain Riga remains functional rather than crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore (logbook discrepancy → coordinate discovery → bunker salvage → renunciation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost as she steers toward open river. No orientation debt; transitions are legible. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Twilight canal, reeds, fog, and the half-submerged bunker are vivid, selective, and pressure the action (hidden cut, salvage logistics). The sundial as micro-setting constrains the final choice when its shadow becomes meaningless in daylight. Sensory hierarchy filters through Mara’s urgency; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—tightens decisively when journals confirm betrayal; options narrow to renunciation. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven; cost is visible (loss of inherited myth, lifelong burden). No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events: inherited heroism vs. sacrificed lives. Final image—steaming wake as “sentence spoken at last”—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in logbook smudges and sundial tooth-marks carries the lie’s blueprint. Complexity lingers; no tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Mara’s perceptual signature; diction (“serene upheaval,” “architecture of lies”) is consistent and purposeful. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression and elision (e.g., “shipping forecast” shorthand) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language serves rather than stalls. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports pressure. Minor elevated diction (“palimpsests,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Mara’s erudition without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: war-myth archaeology via barge salvage, pocket sundial as forensic tool. Trope of “hero father” is inverted through specific journals and erased coordinates. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Transformation test passes; story could not swap names/places without loss.</comment>
