<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is vivid—tasting memory on the seed, feeling the loom buckle—but the “insatiably creative” trait is asserted more than embodied; the final renunciation lands with cost yet leans on lyrical summary rather than a last embodied beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: Arin shifts from hoarding to sharing wonder, paid for by the loom’s collapse and his perpetual wandering; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as color density reweights the world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The parapet, waterfall, and living loom are tactile and atmospheric; the loom-as-micro-setting constrains every grafting choice and charges the final image when it snaps, anchoring the fantastical in sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes—wonder fading from the world—escalate as color bleeds away; the single decisive turn (let the color go) narrows options and exacts the loom’s destruction, though external opposition remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder preserved only by dispersal, never possession; the final image of drifting color reconfigures the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic cadence that modulates under pressure; perceptual signature (taste of seed, shimmer of veil) stays consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional lyrical surplus (“threads of liquid light weaving between worlds”) risks overwriting yet never stalls momentum or muddles causality at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The grafting of wonder into living wood, then releasing it as airborne color, is a fresh synthesis; the inversion of capture-as-loss into release-as-preservation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
