<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs. willing punch-line—are dramatized in embodied beats (pocketing the arrowhead, pressing flint to soil). The final metamorphosis is earned by the spiral bruise and childhood wish, paying the cost of her human form. Interiority stays specific, never drifts into label-speak. One dock: the ten-year-old wish is revealed late, so the depth of her flaw feels retro-fitted rather than compounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s bitterness becomes the city’s shared joke, cost paid by her cracked-open body. Accumulative lens holds—each static confession adds density until the rooftop reconfiguration. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors (moon-white mandrake, glass ceiling). Minor slack: the “missing return changed” timestamp is abstract, not causally tied to her first beat, so the inciting pressure feels announced rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underground garden’s living vines and singing mandrakes constrain every move; the rooftop frost spells literal choices in cat’s cradles. Micro-setting (arrowhead, spiral bruise) doubles as environment that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—botanist notices root motion, not tourist visuals. One slip: spatial track of the herbalist’s note is ghosted; we never see Mara read it, so the setting voice feels disembodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she deliver the flint and become the joke—tightens when roots embrace the arrowhead, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates by accretion: each confession adds frostbitten hope until the cost of transformation is undeniable. Agency is hers; she climbs the vines and fuses the flint. The price (loss of human form) is legible, but the middle lacks a visible tactic-altering loss; escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of harmony into untamed punch-line; no character states the thesis. The flint-dust benediction reweights earlier grief without moralizing. Final image—“harmony untamed is just another name for love that refuses to behave”—is earned by the spiral of confessions and rooftop laughter. Ambiguity lingers: the city’s joy is beautiful and creepy, refusing tidy comfort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively Mara’s: scientific precision (“moon-white mandrake”) collides with cosmic jest (“gravitational fireflies”). Rhythm accelerates under pressure—single-sentence paragraph “She circled once…” beats wings in 3/4 time. No head-hopping; POV stays tight third. One hairline: “bitterness into a cosmic joke” borders on thematic echo, but it’s spoken into static, so self-awareness is motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without scaffold. Mixed metaphors are controlled (“static laughed…snow collapsing”) and paid off. No loops or synonym churn; each descriptor is irreplaceable. A single purple flicker: “antennae tasting starlight” is borderline, but the POV has already metamorphosed, so sensory stretch is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Takes the tired “missing hikers return changed” trope and flips it into a city-wide rehearsal for a joke. The cordless phone as confession booth, flint as punch-line delivery device—synthesis feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk: protagonist becomes moth-god without losing narrative coherence; reward: communal laughter that evaporates bitterness. Specificity of spiral frost on telephone wires anchors the cosmic in the municipal.</comment>
