<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vale’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to let go—are embodied in the arrowhead’s warmth and her rising feet; the final levitation crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vale’s transformation reweights the premise, cost is felt in the shattered glass and frostbitten hope; causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden’s gravity-defying herbs and frost actively constrain tactics and charge the final image; micro-setting (arrowhead) doubles as setting-object that bends starlight with Vale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—turn bitterness into levity—tightens once via arrowhead resonance and levitation; escalation is driven by Vale’s agency with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete events: grief transmuted to cosmic joke; final image of dancing among stars reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature (crushed-pine-needle eyes, frostbitten laughter) remains coherent; no head-hopping, compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>High density, no loops; figurative language serves pressure; minor overwrought phrases (“bridal train of frozen tears”) but clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid hunt and grief therapy via gravity-bending wraith; risk-taking in levitation payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
