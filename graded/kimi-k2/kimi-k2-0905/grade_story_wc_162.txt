<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Juniper’s barefoot reading of floorboards and her father’s logbook codes ground interiority in tactile micro-choices; the final “invent their own way home” crystallizes earned endurance with visible cost. Motive remains consistent—discovering thresholds—yet the causal link between wood-grain decoding and maze-entry feels slightly abstract, blurring the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Juniper steps off the terrace into the maze-between-heartbeats, reweighting “necessary distances” with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of drift, grain, and logbook pages tightens toward the final image—though the moment of maze dissolution could be one beat sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace, oak table scars, and moth-wing logbook pages are selective, sensorily rich, and directly constrain Juniper’s path; the terrace’s westward creep charges the final step-off. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—tightens through escalating sensory pressure: each decoded ring narrows options until the final step into air. Cost is legible in the irreversible fall-through; butterfly-effect backstory complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges from grain, drift, and logbook without sermonizing; the ending reweights “necessary distances” as the price of self-invention. Subtext in wood memory and storm codes invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric compression (“featherly determined steps,” “fractured hush”) is consistent, taught early, and paid off in the final cadence. Perceptual signature—Juniper’s synesthetic reading of weather in wood—remains distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence layers image, memory, and motion; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (moth wings, ship-creak) are precise and non-contradictory, accelerating toward the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “lost child” trope through meteorological maze-craft and wood-grain cartography; the butterfly-effect premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of drift-rate and weather codes anchors universals without gimmickry.</comment>
