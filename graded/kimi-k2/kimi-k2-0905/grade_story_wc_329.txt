<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Calla’s contradictory impulses—yearning to save beauty yet fearing the cost—are embodied in her arrhythmic heartbeat and the trembling bow. Micro-choices (skipping every fourth beat, kneeling to plunge fingers into glass) reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—walking away without looking back—earns its cost through prior causality and the visible loss of the locust-shell map. Interiority stays concrete; no stock labels intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each musical phrase layers density until the bridge, statues, and orchard reconfigure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—orchard blooms outward, gears freeze—cost felt in the ribbon of dawn that stitches sky to gentler earth. Causality is tight: lullaby → statue hesitation → seed uprooted → gold-dust re-inscription. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass planks, bronze gears, and apricot blossoms are filtered through Calla’s urgent perception; each detail constrains movement or enables tactics. The locust shell doubles as micro-setting and map, its veins matching bridge cables and dissolving into instructions. Spatial choreography is clean: three planks advanced, bridge sway, statues mid-step freeze. Final image—orchard blooming outward—recharges every prior sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty before calcification—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Calla must choose between uprooting the seed and losing her only map. Escalation is accumulative: each softer note increases the cost of discovery. The final beat narrows options irrevocably; the orchard’s transformation is the visible price. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mechanical order and living wonder, never stated outright. Subtext lives in gestures: statue’s cracked smile, seed pulsing sunrise-through-closed-eyes. Final image—child holding humming seed—offers a non-literal answer: beauty escapes systems, travels on remembered wings. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Calla; perceptual signature is musical and tactile—“bow tasting dusk air,” “heartbeat conducting.” Syntax mirrors arrhythmia: occasional skipped cadence, soft-plosive consonants. No head-hopping; every sensory filter is hers. Voice modulates under pressure, compressing diction as stakes rise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“apricot blossoms drifted upward instead of down”—and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene needs: longer lyrical lines for wonder, clipped fragments under pressure. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk orchard, living statues, and music-as-code into an inevitable synthesis. The locust-shell map and heartbeat lullaby feel non-obvious yet foreshadowed. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped. Risk—lyric compression, reversed gravity—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: beauty escapes upward by blooming outward.</comment>
