<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Calla’s contradictory yearning—save beauty yet abandon knowing—shows in embodied heart-as-score and fingertip decisions each with felt cost. Emotional layering is specific, but the gardener’s off-stage history looms large without on-page re-penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under Accumulative/Textural lens, closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “beauty, once reawakened, travels on its own legs.” Bridge dissolving into dawn and seeds humming west enact earned cost. Pattern taught early (shell vibration, heartbeat metronome), legibility sustained to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sky-bridge cables, statues’ metal cool, apricot lanterns, and the empty pocket shell all constrain choices and charge final image; the orchard literally re-roots itself, grounding wonder. Spatial anchors clear, no penalty taken.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent orchard calcification—tightens through each statuary eyelid droop and seed-borne pulse. Mid-scene tightening reverses gravity of blossoms; final “fruit tasting faintly of escape” pays visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Theme of beauty’s fugitive resurgence blooms from mechanical/statue image pattern without direct thesis. Last line reframes gardener exodus into child-found resonance, earning wisdom through tactile inversion (taste of escape).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Narrative voice sustains lyric compression (“papery and translucent,” “resonantly soft”) that teaches pattern early. POV stable; free-indirect dips feel motivated, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies, metaphors tight rather than overwritten. Metaphor “tasting of iron and apricot” does double duty. Zero loops or redundant phrasing, information density high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanical orchard becomes living memory, locust shell as map-become-metamorph-guide. Inversion of gravity for blossoms feels risk-taken and inevitable. No recognizable trope untouched.</comment>
