<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s curator identity and “built her life on listening” anchor every choice; her refusal to open the box crystallizes an earned renunciation that costs her the certainty of proof, satisfying Earned Stasis. Interiority is concrete (“settled like dust between her ribs”), and micro-choices (borrowing borescope, sitting without tools) track escalating stakes. The final click inside her chest externalizes the cost without therapy-speak. No relationship crucible on page, so cap at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mailbox’s silence absorbs the courtyard’s grief, reconfiguring the community’s stance toward listening. Causal chain—rumor → borescope attempt → renunciation—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the “empty velvet cushion” and the locket’s final click. Orientation anchors by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rose-gold dawn tiles, cool mosaics, and the fountain’s hush are filtered through Mira’s curator gaze; each sensory beat guides her next action (waiting, listening, sitting). The mailbox itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice: it “does not want to be opened.” Spatial choreography remains coherent; courtyard scale subtly expands after the collective silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove listening heals—tightens when the borescope reveals only darkness, forcing renunciation. Pressure escalates via communal gathering and slowing heartbeat; no external antagonist needed. Cost is the forfeiture of empirical proof, replaced by communal witness. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as healing is never asserted but enacted through the courtyard’s shared silence and Mira’s final display cushion. Subtext resides in the locket’s migration and the mailbox’s refusal. Final image reweights the premise—listening is the key we already are—without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the “sandstorm that has spent itself.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is curator-cool (“objects return to stories, not places”). Rhythm modulates from hushed dawn to communal stillness; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“whispered that the locked mailbox…”). Voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; “heartbeat slower than clocks” is precise metaphor without muddle. Sensory specificity (“mint tea into tiny glasses”) replaces filler. Final line’s sandstorm simile lands clean and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar grief-healing trope is inverted: the mailbox’s refusal to open becomes the cure. Locket-as-heart motif is specific to Samara and Mira, not generic. Risk taken in quiet, communal climax pays off. Fresh synthesis: a locked box that teaches the key is presence, not intrusion.</comment>
