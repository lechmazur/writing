<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to safeguard innovation is stated but not dramatized; emotions are atmospheric (“pulse matched the storm”) rather than embodied contradiction. One micro-turn occurs: kneeling to plant while sensing future time-loops, but the climactic decision to mutate with the building feels externally compelled rather than an earned internal renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira accepts the labyrinth as self-writing, foreclosing safe control. The letter-from-tomorrow paradox is unexplained until retroactively forgiven by the final paragraph; no felt cost for this causality break appears on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric—“storm-born silence,” “reversed brook” constrains perception but rarely action. Final chamber loam and glass floor supply the only tactile constraint for the planting beat; other locales function as mood scaffolding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: allow the labyrinth to re-architect itself or seal the sanctuary. One meaningful tightening occurs when vines emerge before the second thunderclap; thereafter escalation relies on plant choreography rather than human agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-renovating wonder emerges from image chain—growing riddles, reversed brook, lantern-seeds—without authorial statement. Echo of Mira’s older self offers quiet CR, but the conceptual cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice channels atmospheric horror-puzzle, sustaining sustained hush and vegetal texture. Single-POV stays stable; occasional elevated diction (“vegetal pulse,” “orthogonal angles”) nudges toward thesaurus drift but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in rhythm without loops; figurative language occasionally overloads—“gills,” “innovation as stench”—but never clouds action. Final image of dawn perfume versus decay lands clearly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Escape-room-as-metabolic-organ is fresh, and using a corpse-flower as an architect solves an originality test. Risk lies in folding ecological horror into puzzle logic; synthesis succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
