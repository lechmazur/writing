<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (preserve sanctuary vs. let it mutate) act simultaneously in scene. The final smile at the backward-flowing brook crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost—she cedes authorship of her labyrinth. Micro-choices (prying glass, sprinting to levers) reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Yet the fugue-state handwriting remains a convenient amnesia that blunts motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mill rewrites itself, Mira accepts perpetual mutation, and guests unknowingly pollinate future puzzles. Causal linkage holds—seed planted before second thunderclap triggers spatial inversion—though the handwriting-from-tomorrow device is a mild causality cheat. Orientation is swift; stakes escalate because each lever redirects vegetal growth with on-page cost. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass-floor loam, reversed brook, and breathing walls are vivid, selective, and purposeful; they constrain Mira’s choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather (storm-born silence) affects action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s priorities—sticky pulp, cold exhalation, phosphorescent seeds. Setting evolves causally with the seed’s geometry, no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguarding space for innovation—is signaled early and reweighted by the seed’s demand. Escalation occurs through Mira’s agency: each lever pull redirects growth, foreclosing her original control. Cost is visible—she loses sole authorship, gains co-creation with the building. No external antagonist needed; pressure tightens under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: innovation requires surrendering control, letting systems mutate orthogonal to time. Subtext operates in the seed’s stench vs. wonder paradox and the guests-as-pollinators irony. Final image of empty tomorrow envelope reweights premise without moralizing. Recurring motifs (storm-born silence, orthogonal angles) accumulate pressure rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mira’s puzzle-designer lens (“gears clicked like anxious teeth”). Syntax modulates with urgency—compressed during sprint, expansive during revelation. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Non-standard grammar is absent, but patterned diction (“orthogonal,” “storm-born silence”) is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs. Figurative language is selective—no purple stacks in peak beats. Minor scaffold: “quiet wool” cliché and slight synonym churn around “possibility just born.” Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are clean. No loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: escape-room-as-living-puzzle, corpse-flower-as-innovation-engine. Tropes are transformed—seed mail from future self becomes recursive design loop. Specificity anchors universals: phosphorescent seeds as future labyrinths. Risk-taking (building breathes, brook reverses) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
