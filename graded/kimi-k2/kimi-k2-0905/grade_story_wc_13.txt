<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s grief-driven quest is embodied through precise micro-choices (the breath cadence, stepping against reversed water) and a credible renunciation of future minutes; interior contradiction surfaces in the ledger of borrowed time. The final acceptance of sealed memory carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed pendant crystallizes the cost of uncaging echoes and forecloses further time-borrowing. Causal chain (cadence → reversed flow → cage → doorway → sealed loop) holds without contradiction under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is not mere backdrop; its reversed current and clock-hand aviary physically constrain Mira’s path and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the limestone lip, living wisteria) integrates with action to satisfy the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the unfinished syllable—tightens when each borrowed second must be repaid with unlived future. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the felt price (pendant sealed, future surrendered) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus possibility emerges through the Möbius pendant and the uncaged echoes; no moralizing, only the resonant image of a sealed loop that reweights earlier motifs. Subtext operates in silence after the final syllable is absorbed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—liquid lace, silverfish fleeing, musical notation of steam—mirrors Mira’s illustrator’s eye without slipping into purple. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping; rhythmic control heightens pressure during cadence recitations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances image, action, or emotional charge. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. The final paragraph’s quiet diction lands the closure beat cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The giant’s nap as a literal time-borrowing mechanism feels inevitable yet fresh; transformation of the infinity symbol into a Möbius strip that seals memory is specific to this voice. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
