<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bell ringer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing the cracked lens, her voice “propelling itself across the room.” Yet her contradictory impulses (preserve vs. transform) are stated more than dramatized in scene, and the final renunciation feels slightly abstract rather than paid for by a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the laboratory’s purpose flips from preservation to creation, crystallized in the cracked lens left as an offering. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of imagery and cadence shift reweight the stake. One minor drag: the “artificial pilgrimage” premise is announced rather than taught early, causing a brief orientation wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Environment is tactile and selective—golden shadows, silent machinery, spiral of broken chimes. The carbide lamp lens functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice (left behind as guiding object). Spatial choreography remains coherent; only the phrase “cathedral of forgotten frequencies” edges toward grand abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why her bells no longer ring true—tightens when she questions the collectors’ assumptions, forcing a collective stance shift. The cost (abandoning the old chimes and the lens) is legible but lightly dramatized; escalation is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mourning silence vs. learning its music. The cracked lens reframes loss into generative possibility without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material—laboratory becomes “laboratory of learning sounds”—yet the conceptual cost feels slightly cerebral rather than gut-level.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: “powerfully gentle weight,” “spectral pathways.” Patterned elision (“propelling itself”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the bell ringer’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with rhythmic variation and zero loops. Occasional elevated diction (“mechanical lullabies,” “conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but stays within the lyrical frame. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-stability world where artificial pilgrimage replaces tradition—is fresh and non-obvious. The cracked lens as both relic and beacon transforms familiar symbols. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
