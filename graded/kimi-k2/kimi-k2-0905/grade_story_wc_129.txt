<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—solitude vs. kinship—are embodied in her peat-scented fingers and the reed-heart scar. Her choice to lift the tag rather than claim it crystallizes her arc with visible cost. The group’s growth from one to thirty-seven is choreographed cleanly, and every micro-choice (offering guidance, weaving reed arbors) reweights her social credit. Only the “boldly sympathetic” label feels slightly asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tag dissolves, leaving the scarred palm and communal studio—felt cost on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn adds density until the final illumination reconfigures belonging. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props or causality breaks. The 13-morning arc tightens once, then crystallizes in the shared light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and reed sculptures are vivid, selective, and purposeful. The arbor’s mirrored corridors fracture reflections, constraining movement and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the crater rim, orchard, and studio track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors chime, frost, and refracted light—precisely what a sculptor–cartographer pair would notice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging vs. solitude—is signaled early and escalates through each dawn’s search. The tightening occurs when Emil cedes the discovery to Lira, foreclosing solo glory. Cost is visible: the tag dissolves, leaving a scar and a communal vow. Agency remains with the group; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: kinship is enacted, not found. The reed-heart tag reframes earlier “mystery” as collaborative attention. Subtext lives in gesture—Emil’s silent step aside, the elder’s translucent saplings. The final image of children’s laughter refracted into color-constellations offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity: “peat and sap,” “breath through teeth.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell; longer sentences during communal weaving, clipped fragments at discovery. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Lira’s perception. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Emil’s confession and silent gesture carry weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. No loops or scaffold; “luminescent ache” is earned, not decorative. Metaphors are coherent—reed grafting as kinship grafting. Rhythm accelerates toward the final illumination, then settles into the communal studio image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of street-art myth, glass orchard, and reed-sculptor community feels fresh and inevitable. The “tag” as collective act rather than individual signature transforms a familiar trope. Specificity—phonograph-horn beehives, backward-speaking twins—grounds the world. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final refracted laughter.</comment>
