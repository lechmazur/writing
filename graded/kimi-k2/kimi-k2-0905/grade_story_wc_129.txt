<comment>Lira’s ache to belong and fear of failed breath-pledge anchor motive cleanly; her tactile re-sculpting of kinship itself through crystal touch and final decision to walk deeper show earned transformation. Interior contradictions stay embodied—"her lungs felt sewn shut by doubt"—and the shift from spectator to constellation-maker carries visible social cost. Voice is idiosyncratic; no therapy-speak intrudes. Relationships with twins serve as crucible, forcing Lira to name the moment, altering their trio status on page.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as a coherent Resonant Reconfiguration: the glyph-net reconfigures prior “webs of kinship” from inherited myth to forged responsibility, with the image of ‘heron cradling a reed’ making the cost legible (she can no longer remain merely solitary observer). Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural—density of etched names and heron traces accumulates into final cadence lift. Mosaic shard (arbor → orchard → deeper trek) is taught early and transitions remain legible; no orientation debt. Cost is unmistakable on-page.</comment>

<comment>The crystalline orchard’s chimed starlight, moonstone paths, and obsidian arbor don’t just backdrop; the arbor’s warm volcanic glass and glyph condensation directly gate Lira’s decision to exhale or not, constraining choice at climax. Recurring crystal trunks and reed references are filtered through sensory POV bias—she sniffs for silver tang—ground spatial choreography. Environment evolves: dusk deepens tone, cracks of light momentarily silhouette shared seekers, tying her body to communal silhouette. Setting re-charges final image as living constellation.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—“belong somewhere”—is articulated up-front; pressure tightens when Lira fears her glyph won’t form, then deepens via shared search and irrevocable cost after the net of faces appears. Agency is continuous: each decision to pursue tag, touch mercury, and finally propose “farther in” progressively narrows option back to solitary retreat. Coincidence allowed: twins appear, but resolution is earned by Lira’s stance crystallization. Cost is visible and social—now a signpost attracting future feet, burden she accepted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of kinship as a choice-made web emerges organically from the orchard’s glyph system and Lira’s final re-signing; no moralizing lines intrude. Subtext sits in the silences between twins and in the trembling mercury imagery. Final “constellation for future feet” answers the desire without stating it, reweighting prior solitude. Image sequence of cradling reed vs bent reeds layers motif without checklist abuse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Limited dialogue remains sparse and goal-driven—twins’ braided voices echo orchard tone, each couple murmurs coordinates—serving the communal texture. Percussion-heavy lyric cadence accelerates under pressure then gentles the descent. POV distance stays tight to Lira; no leakage. Register consistency: peat, sap, blade-music fit sculptor without academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose wields selective, high-density detail—“quicksilver stayed wet for days” or “hum with stored starlight”—without overwriting; each image carries dual sensory charge. Rhythm breathes with action: inhalation of crater, exhalation of glyph. No loops, repetition, or scaffold. Metaphors interlock rather than contradict. Minor lyrical lifts never obscure cause-effect clarity near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Central conceit—community memory literally grows as glass etchings—feels freshly embodied. Familiar quest for belonging is twisted through sculptor’s tactile idiom and orchard’s chiming botany. No stock “chosen one” echoes; heron tag migrates into constellation without gimmick. Risky lyric compression coheres rather than obscures. Transformation test fails for any generic substitution.</question>
