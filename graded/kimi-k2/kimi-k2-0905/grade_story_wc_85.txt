<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt and self-loathing are viscerally embodied; every tactile beat (pitch-black palms, sagging pockets, copper-tasting powder) sharpens her interior contradiction. The micro-choice to carve false memories into driftwood crystallizes her need to offload weight, and the final renunciation—threading shells onto the watch hand—earns its cost by exposing the brother-shaped void. Interiority stays specific and un-diagnostic; no stock phrases intrude. The only limit is that the brother’s death is backstory, not an on-page relationship, so the relational crucible bullet is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s casting of the shell-rosary reweights the entire premise—guilt can be balanced but not erased. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each carved lie thickens the “sieved hush” until the final cadence shift (“electric hum replacing the hush”) marks the before/after. Causality is intact: because she forged pedigrees, therefore the void grew; because she speaks the name, therefore the wood splits and the rosary is offered. Cost is legible in the single drop of seawater-blood and the emptied pockets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, driftwood, and watch hand form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the terrace’s edge forces the kneeling posture, the driftwood’s grain dictates where new lies can be carved, the watch hand becomes both stylus and needle. Sensory selection is urgent—salt, copper, barnacles—filtered through Mara’s guilt-sharpened perception. The final image of “indigo erasing the line between water and sky” recharges the opening bruised-purple sky, integrating setting into closure. No spatial drift or white-room lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can guilt be offloaded?—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens through each beat: every carved lie increases the void’s mass. The meaningful deepening occurs when the driftwood warms and the watch hand ticks once, forcing Mara to confront that metal does not forget. Agency is hers: she chooses confession and the rosary-casting. Cost is visible—the stinging seawater drop, the balanced-but-emptied pockets.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the arithmetic of guilt: every false memory adds mass to the void. The driftwood’s hollow of shell-mouths offers a non-literal answer—guilt can be cradled but not silenced. Subtext operates in gesture (threading shells, casting them) rather than statement. No moralizing; the final electric hum is an honest sound for the living, not a sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“tasting of salt and copper, and the sieved hush inside her coarsened”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices grain-whorls like cochleae, fingerprints etched in brass. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Experimental compression (“the wood spoke / Not in voice but in grain”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, emotion, or causality. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, never muddled. Syntax modulates with stress—long sinuous sentences collapse into fragments at climax. No register drift or mixed metaphors. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of genealogy forgery, driftwood memory-incense, and watch-hand rosary feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals: the refugee’s false childhood, the brother’s boat that never arrived. No derivative templates; the premise could not survive name-swaps.</comment>
