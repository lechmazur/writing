<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forager’s interior contradiction—clinging to rationality while chasing a magical cure—is dramatized in every beat; the final choice to drink the luminous mud costs him his self-exculpatory distance and is earned by the orchard’s relentless mirroring of his swallowed apologies. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“cultivate psychological safety”) that momentarily lifts us out of embodied crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to bear the communal echo rather than silence it carries unmistakable cost—he leaves the ravine “safely tethered by truthful silence,” a charged poise that forecloses the earlier goal of muting empathy. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each storm-saturated image tightens the stake until the antique eye fuses literal and metaphorical sight. Orientation is swift; the ravine, rope ladder, and virus-scarred world are anchored within fifty words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard functions as both environment and psychic crucible: roots “like nooses,” fruits knocking “like teeth,” and the luminous film crawling toward boots all constrain the final choice to drink. Weather, topography, and relic are inseparable; the storm-green iris of the glass eye literally colors the sky, welding setting to perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet the communal heart—tightens when the mixture is scattered and re-forms as sentient film, forcing a binary: erase or endure. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn; no coincidence rescues him. Cost is legible in the burning pocket and the final “unshared yet unafraid” pulse that accepts lifelong porterage of others’ grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s refusal to let memory rot: bearing witness is the only cultivar that survives. The glass eye’s migration from relic to lens literalizes the moral reweighting without sermon. Final image of planting new truffles “round the shape of what we cannot fix” offers resonant, non-didactic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a dense, fungal syntax—spongy clauses, spore-sized pauses—that mirrors the truffle’s texture and the mind’s mycelial guilt. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains consistent even when vision splits. Compression (“I will occlude you”) is taught early and paid off when occlusion fails.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhythm flexes with pressure—long humid sentences pre-storm, staccato beats during branch fall. Metaphors stay coherent (storm-green iris → sky color) and information-dense lines carry double duty. Minor scaffold: two adjacent “like” similes could be pruned, but they do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Virus-forced empathy as weather-borne regret is fresh; grafting truffle spores and powdered glass eye into a credible folk-chemistry cure deepens the conceit. Risk—lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals—pays off when the luminous film rises. Specificity of Sister Imelda’s smuggled relic keeps the world from sliding into generic dystopia.</comment>
