<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s rational armor cracks under the orchard’s pressure, culminating in the earned stasis of staying to tend the confessional grove. The sister’s ghost arrives too late to test status dynamics, so relationship crucible is only implied. Micro-choices (planting the eye, threading the glass lanterns) crystallize values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard becomes a living confessional, the narrator’s stance irrevocably shifted from isolation to stewardship. Causal chain holds—eye found → secrets forced → planted → orchard transformed—without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; mosaic shards are legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is no backdrop; its storm-scarred bark and dangling fruit physically constrain every move and charge the final image of lantern-eyes. Micro-setting (the mother tree’s lightning calligraphy) functions as both shrine and witness. Weather and terrain shape tactics—no shelter, only exposure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety versus involuntary truth—tightens with each storm. Agency is exercised in planting the eye, a decisive act that forecloses escape and redefines safety as communal absorption. Cost is legible: permanent self-exposure in exchange for refuge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of guarded versus shared grief emerges through concrete particulars: truffles, glass eyes, storm-lanterns. No moralizing; the orchard’s mute absorption offers a non-literal answer to the cost of honesty. Final image of “fractured grace” reweights earlier guilt without naming it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—rational, spore-counting diction eroded by lyric urgency. Syntax mirrors the narrator’s fraying composure: longer clauses collapse into fragments as storms intensify. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined to the orchard’s logic (“fruit glowing pale as moonlit bones”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“psychological safety as a garden”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic pastoral and relic horror; the empathy virus transmuted into arboreal absolution feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky inversion—truth as contagion, orchard as therapist—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of truffle forager’s gaze grounds the uncanny.</comment>
