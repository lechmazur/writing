<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct interior voice and embodied contradiction—his tremor on the trumpet’s mouthpiece is tactile micro-choice—but the woman’s motive leans on thematic assertion rather than interior action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Framed as causal quest: valve → trumpet → mouthpiece → note, each stage narrowing options; final tone “folded into every doorway” reweights the city’s silence with Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ivory harbor’s salt-cracked docks, tarp smells, and stone-still bell tower ground choices; the trumpet bore warming “as skin remembered skin” functions as micro-setting that constrains the reunion and finale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tension escalates by “exile archives” mandate until the single note crystallizes meaning; cost is the woman relinquishing her memento and the archivist his protective emptiness.</answer>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance versus purposeful forgetting unfolds through objects not exposition; the trumpet’s reassembled silence offers a resonant reconfiguration of absence without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rhythm and diction evoke salt-tanged fatigue; staggered, incremental phrasing mirrors the bell’s drunken noon, voice never cracks under emotional load.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric cadences carry near-poetic density yet remain lucid; only slight figurative excess in “absence tasted metallic” brushes past embodied limit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Transforms exile trope into artifact archaeology; singular coastal micro-culture, invented occupation, reclaimed silenced instrument—all specific and necessary.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archivist leads every beat of quest, negotiation, and final sounding; his micro-choice to trade future archive for mouthpiece is pivotal.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Valve threads the middle beats, its brass fit exact; only returns in closure via the trumpet, yet memory-heat cues the final note’s earned resonance.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Navigated absences shift from bureaucratic to sonic, culminating in the harbor’s written margin, but late appearance caps it below 8.0.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Archivist must “prove” vision, and the old janitor tests him—trumpet reunion verifies trait; still feels ascribed more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Blowing the note is decisive act that heartens the city and closes arc; its singular tone replaces archive and rewrites exile’s silence. 8.5-10 applies fully.</answer>
<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Bell tower’s drunken staggered intervals recurs, but phrase appears only in setting, not driving tactics—functional but replaceable band.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</question><comment>Harbor grounds the stakes and sets atmospheric tone, yet another coastal city could substitute—strong sensory but mid-line necessity.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</comment><comment>Ends of exile prompt quest urgency, time is present but abstract constraint; absence tracks years lost without a ticking clock pressing the beat.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Desire to compile memory into new archive is dramatized: he bargains the catalog for the mouthpiece and seals the act with the note, closing the loop.</comment>
