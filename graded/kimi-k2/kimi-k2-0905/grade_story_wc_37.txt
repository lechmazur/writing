<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical yet grounded in embodied action; the keeper’s micro-choices (pressing mica, singing, driving shards into ribs) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of her name is earned by prior pain and memory recovery. Minor slip: “bound release” is asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the realm’s dawn becomes self-sustaining, the keeper’s body bears fused mica scars—felt cost on the page. Causal chain holds: song summons silhouettes → chorus rewoven → night scab lifts. Mosaic shards (mirror orchard, inverted greenhouse) are taught early and cohere at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s glass, quicksilver roots, and ticking fruit constrain tactics and charge the final lantern image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: starlight, phosphor sting, warm bark. Spatial choreography remains legible across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore dying realm—tightens through escalating song attempts and tarry night’s counter-pressure. One decisive turn: keeper alters lullaby into invitation, forcing every reflection to sing its neighbor’s verse. Cost is visible in bleeding mica and scarred ribs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective memory and mutual reflection emerges from concrete events: songs knit communities, mirrors refuse light, realm revives when reflections sing each other. Final image of ordinary trees sprouting from quicksilver soil reweights the alchemical premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through the keeper’s synesthetic lens (“fruits chimed,” “phosphor stung like remembered joy”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—cracked singing, shouted name—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor overwriting in “tarry vines coagulating” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemical orchard as memory loom, mirror world as collective amnesia, songs as dawns. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final lantern image. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative.</comment>
