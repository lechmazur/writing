<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—wanting to restore Viremont while knowing he must surrender his own bell/heartbeat—drives every step; the embodied cost (fork against sternum, transparency at the edges) makes the renunciation legible. The “infinitely patient” trait is dramatized through the seven slow circuits, not asserted. Missing external status dynamics (no second character) keeps score sub-9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town rebuilt, Elian suspended as the tenth bell, cost paid in his literal dissolution. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each circuit adds density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake from “restore town” to “town now owns its rhythm.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One shard, single POV, within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is micro-scaled to body, tool, and cobblestones; the fork’s changing sheen and the keystone mouth constrain Elian’s choices. Viremont’s nine-hundred-bell history is filtered through present ruins, never dumped. The north ward’s refusal to rise supplies concrete resistance, charging the final image. Environment directly shapes tactics—heel-toe rhythm is the literal rebuild engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“heal place by tuning its bones”—tightens when the north ward resists, forcing Elian to offer his heartbeat. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Cost is visible: fork shatters, Elian becomes bell. Coincidence absent; all escalation driven by his iterated action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restorative forgiveness emerges through the fork drinking footstep-memories and Elian surrendering his own rhythm; no moralizing statement. Final image of the town poised at dawn reweights the opening “wild hush” into anticipatory chord. Subtext in the librarian shelving by overtones, children jumping to vesper bell—specific particulars, not abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person tightly focalized through Elian’s perceptual bias: “moonlight tastes on the tongue of a sleepwalker.” Rhythm accelerates with enjambed clauses during rebuild, then exhales into the final suspended bell image. No head-hopping; distance stable. Patterned elision (“not with sound, but with absence”) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and cadence; high density—each line advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and coherent: “bruised clanks” marries sound and injury. One mixed-metaphor risk—“smoke that had forgotten how to rise”—reads intentional to the town’s inversion and does not blur causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tempris, the lost art of place-healing via footstep-rhythm, feels fresh and inevitable; the tuning fork as black-hole-absence is a specific, non-obvious instrument. Risky lyric compression succeeds under Accumulative lens. Transformation test: swap fork for generic wand and story collapses—proof of integration.</comment>
