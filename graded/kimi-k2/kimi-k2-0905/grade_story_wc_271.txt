<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit—surviving a wedding drone strike—and the interior battle between memory and living is embodied in the “somatic map.” Micro-choice of pressing the rib to invoke Arbutus unedo reveals a precise coping grammar. The final “hand on the resin-sealed trunk” crystallizes earned renunciation; cost is felt: Nadia’s photograph leaves while the scar stays. Minor slip: “cling to life like…” simile momentarily abstracts rather than bodies the drive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens as each anchor scent (salt, eucalyptus, sweat) reweights survival. Closure is earned Charged Poise—photo released, new covenant sworn under resin, cost visible: tomorrow now demands living. Orientation (who/where anchored by line 3) and micro-turn (freeze exercise to final release) land cleanly. Light deduction for off-stage drone strike; the explosion is retrospective, lessening causal immediacy on scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Arboretum’s cliff edge, resin-scarred pines, and the ghost lighthouse form a textured pressure system: “the soil is thin and roots grip stone like desperate fingers” merges threat with embodiment. Sea-lavender behind the ear is physical cost that later scents the moment. Micro-setting (photograph fused to bark) charges the final covenant. No object constrains choice in a novel way, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake = reconciling tomorrow with unalterable past; each somatic marker act narrows coping options until the final release replaces avoidance with lived stewardship. Escalation is internal but legible—grief spikes, freeze fails to hold, photograph surrendered—culminating in renunciation that forecloses perpetual revisiting of dead. Cost: Nadia permanently sealed in arboretum resin, narrator consigned to life.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—grief as coastline to learn, not landmine to flee—emerges through lived geography of salt wounds and resin grafts. No moral pronouncements; final image of oxygen not of metal carries conceptual repricing that silently insists on possibility. Subtext breathes in the smear of dragon’s blood incense/iodine—ritual turned anatomy. Echo of “possible mornings” reweights every prior sensory anchor.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric interiority is sustained, sentence to sentence. Filtered perception (“wind combs the cliff with a sound like tearing paper”) shows idiosyncratic attention consistent with survivor hyper-vigilance. No head-hop, no register drift; grief’s clinical diction folds gracefully into incantatory lists of plant Latin. Compression in later beats mirrors emotional staccato: “freeze—breathe—press.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Highly selective sensory lexicon without redundancy; each plant name carries anatomical resonance. Occasional abstraction near climax—“possible mornings”—softens edge yet is earned by concrete soil-work. No loops, no scaffolds, metaphors stable. One run of three similar “I think” cadences is minor (<0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise (post-drone arboretum griefscape) is vivid intersection of real and surreal. Use of somatic botanical re-anchorage reads as new; no close echoes in published landscape. Final resin seal and coastal respiration feel invented whole yet inevitable. Risky choice to hinge closure on ecological metabolics rather than human confrontation fully lands without gimmickry.</question>
