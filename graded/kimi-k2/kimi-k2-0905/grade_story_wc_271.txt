<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The survivor’s embodiment of grief through plant-specific somatic anchors is vivid; each “micro-choice” (pressing thumb to scar, sealing the photo) reveals hierarchy of values. Slight slip into therapy-speak (“somatic markers”) without immediate embodied cost at one beat caps ascent from 9. Otherwise contradiction and embodied contradiction feel lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closing renunciation—torn photograph sails seaward while resin-locked laugh remains—is Earned Stasis with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost. Causal lens holds, orientation anchored early, no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Closure is pristine and legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arboretum and resin-coated pine trunk are micro-setting that constrains the final choice: the living bark becomes the gravestone. Spatial choreography is precise; sensory hierarchy is filtered through survivor’s urgent need to plant grief and walk onward. Enough specificity to reach edge but not push to 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with irreparable memory—tightens into a single crystallizing act of relinquishment, cost visible (the lost photo, resin sealing). Agency and pressure cohere under Accumulative/Textural lens, no drift. Missing one stronger mid-scene tactical price prevents 9.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically through plant grief-maps and resin burial; no moralizing finale. The final line “arithmetic of continuation” is earned crystallization, not sermon. Resistant to tidy moral yet coherent; rare hairline lift toward pure resonance just outside 9 due to near-moral phrasing risk.</comment>
