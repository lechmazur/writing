<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s reticence is embodied in her quiet movements and refusal to grandstand, but her interiority stays largely abstract—“weathered innocence” is asserted rather than dramatized. The decisive micro-choice to testify rather than catalogue is credible, yet the cost (renouncing her life-long stance of detached observation) is stated more than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonic fragment layers memory-density until the final image reframes the library as living archive. Closure lands cleanly—“zygote” reweights the premise with conceptual cost—though the causality between crystal pulses and Elara’s decision to testify could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Shadowed library at dawn is sketched with selective sensory strokes; the crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains her listening stance. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the snowdrop’s return in the fallen book charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decoding growth in a post-dictionary silence—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through accumulating sonic fragments, forcing Elara from passive decoding to active testimony; the cost is conceptual (loss of scholarly detachment) rather than viscerally enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of language’s afterlife emerges from concrete particulars: pressed flower, unheard words, final “zygote.” Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no moralizing intrudes. The ending’s reconfiguration invites reflection without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature is scholarly, attentive to sonic texture. Syntax is controlled, rhythm modulates with hush and pulse. No dialogue appears, so voice is carried by filtered perception and memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“sediment,” “new spine”) and never muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold detected. Sentence variety supports the quiet crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—library as living memory after the death of dictionaries—is fresh and executed with conceptual integrity. Tropes of magical objects and post-apocalypse are transformed through scholarly specificity. Final reprise of “zygote” feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
