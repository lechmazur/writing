<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority pulses through every choice—ink, locket, tube—showing contradictory impulses (preserve vs. relinquish) in scene. Micro-choice of sealing the locket inside the tube crystallizes her hierarchy of values and exacts visible cost. Daughter’s gap-toothed echo deepens the personal stake without exposition. Flaw: “haunted euphoria” label edges toward diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: archivist renounces the locket, sealing memory’s conduit into the tube—cost is the literal loss against her pulse. Causal chain (loose board → dare → absence → archivist’s act) tightens to a single irreversible beat. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural: density of sketches and hush reweights stakes. No orientation drift; twilight and jetty anchors arrive by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Jetty’s salt-rimmed planks, sunflower petals fused to wood, and copper tube’s patina constrain every movement and choice. Micro-setting of the locket against wrist and inside tube functions as tactile anchor. Weather and demolition engines press urgency into pacing. One slip: “regenerated covenant stones” remains evocative but not fully integrated as physical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory before demolition—tightens once: security headlights force final sealing. Archivist’s agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the locket’s relocation, felt in the empty cuff. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no secondary stake dilution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as living covenant emerges from ink, sunflower, and sealed tube—never stated, always enacted. Final image of empty cuff and daughter’s music reweights earlier sketches into a resonant afterlife. Subtext in “planting memories” versus “packing” reframes archival labor as generative. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in braided laughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “ink blooming like bruised violets” stays within archivist’s perceptual palette. Rhythm modulates with urgency—long sentences for sketching, staccato when engines growl. No head-hopping; daughter’s dialogue is brief, distinct. Filter verbs minimal; sensory bias sharp (“nets sigh”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive: each line advances memory, decay, or hush. Metaphors precise (“haunted euphoria” aside). No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical. Final paragraph’s “lighter yet heavier” crystallizes without cliché. One mixed metaphor risk—“bruised violets” skirts purple but earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archivist as memory-grafter, covenant as rhythm, negative-space sketching of absence. Walnut ink and sunflower petals feel discovered, not invented. Risk in lyric density pays off in closure resonance. Avoids familiar tropes; even drowned-boy motif is reconfigured through archival absence rather than melodrama.</comment>
