<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“porcelain echo that sliced the salt air”), her contradictory impulse to steer night yet birth dawn crystallizes in the black-flame choice, and the final renunciation (walking inland as reader not herald) carries felt cost. Motivation is ancient-geas rather than personal, but the text roots it in her laugh and the lens, so agency remains legible. No relationship crucible on page, yet single-POV pressure suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse dissolves and Lirael becomes “portable lighthouse,” a charged poise that reconfigures her role and the world’s narrative economy. Causal chain holds—laugh cracks → lens turns → sail forms → wick consumed—each because/therefore tightening options until the blank canvas. Orientation is swift (emerald lighthouse, moonset), and the cost (stars erased, wick gone) is on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The emerald lens and granite tower are not backdrop but active agents: the lens drinks light, the tower launches like a ship, constraining and enabling the final ascent. Micro-setting (glass wick, dew that never knew ink) anchors tactile stakes. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“salt air,” “iron railing”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as the lighthouse glides off its foundation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether shadow can birth dawn without erasing stars—is signaled early and tightened each laugh. Each escalation (lens turns, sail billows, wick shortens) is driven by Lirael’s agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with visible cost (stars thinning, wick vanishing). One decisive tightening suffices at this length; the final choice to laugh again forecloses return to the tower.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete events: obsolete print, living headlines, and the birth of light from shadow. Subtext operates in image (black flame, reversed text on eyelids) rather than statement. Final image—“first letter of the first story that would never need to be recycled”—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers: creation demands erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“laugh cracked, a porcelain echo…”) and consistent perceptual signature. Non-standard grammar (“stars still lied”) is voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue on page, so no voice contamination. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“whale remembering harpoons”). No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated diction (“geas soldered to her laughter”) fits mythic register. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-newsprint lighthouse birthing dawn from shadow—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (lighthouse, prophecy) are transformed through specific material choices (obsolete type, black flame). Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming originality.</comment>
