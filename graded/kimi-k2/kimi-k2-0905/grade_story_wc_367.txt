<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s interior contradiction—duty to an obsolete ritual versus the terror of becoming literal sunrise-maker—is present, but never embodied in tactile micro-choice; the decision to laugh the third time is pivotal yet reads foretold rather than wrestled with, muting felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mosaic Track justifies three time-shifts across stanzas; each shard is legible and returns to a coherent Accumulative/Textural closure where “portable lighthouse under the sky” reconfigures meaning (CR). One Orientation micro-slip mid-shard when geography shifts from tower to prow is tolerated under closure payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric density is striking; the emerald lens and black flame function as constraining props that alter tactics (“pressed the wick against the lens; glass thinned to membrane”). Minor slip—stars briefly become “sail” ropes—resolved under closure power.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single high-stake arc—transform night into dawn—tightens when wick is consumed and stars become “giant wick”. Cost is visible; options collapse. Coincidence of accidental prophecy is refracted, not solved, sustaining pressure until the final image “shadow now shining through her”.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of stories resurrected from obliterated print emerges from concrete actions (inverted headlines, sail of expired columns), not exposition. Final resonance—“first story that would never need to be recycled”—delivers CR without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensuous diction (“glass lantern wick cradled like a chilled vein of lightning”) and languaged perception (“salt air bled silver notes”) sustain a unique lyric voice that modulates intensity without ever drifting into POV bleed or generic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm propels; most lines advance image or action. Occasional ornament overload—three compound metaphors within one sentence—but never clouds causality. Pronoun tracking clean across shards.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Print-as-ash resurrected as living sail is specific, non-obvious synthesis of obsolete media and personal myth-making; risk in mosaic form pays off: the lighthouse becoming both vessel and printing press feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
