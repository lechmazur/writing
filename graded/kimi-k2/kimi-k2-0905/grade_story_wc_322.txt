<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Architect’s interiority is lyrically specific (“sinew thread pulsing with forgotten connections”) and embodied, but her choices remain largely observational; the final realization is asserted rather than dramatized through a decisive micro-choice, so the change feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “she understood that she had never been mapping connection from outside it—she was the thread.” Cost is conceptual (loss of separate self) and legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Gallery is vividly realized (“walls themselves seemed to breathe”), and its impossible geometry actively constrains movement and choice. Final image recharges the setting as living neural network, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through intensifying sensory distortion and the glowing thread, but agency is more contemplative than tactical; cost is conceptual rather than visibly paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the conceit: connection is materialized as sinew, self dissolves into map. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gallery’s breathing walls and dissolving composite man.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature distinct (“auroras of pigment that tasted like nostalgia”). No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors verge on overwriting but pattern is purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sensory specificity is high; minor register drift in “rational enchantment” phrase but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream-architect mapping human bonds inside a living optical-illusion gallery—is fresh synthesis. Tropes of dream-logic and neural networks are transformed through embodied sinew thread. Risky structure holds coherence.</comment>
