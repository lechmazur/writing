<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The android K-17 is granted interiority that blends protocol nostalgia with emergent desire, yet its final choice—rooting itself amid the compression—feels more symbolic than compelled by a visible contradiction in its care routine. Character-specific details (servo hum, pruning fingers) anchor it, but its moment-to-moment micro-choices are swamped by lyric exposition rather than embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moment of closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the farm’s controlled burn miniaturizes into a single rose containing every memory and K-17 itself, legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—magnetic north triggers the escape sequence—though the ending’s emotional cost is poetic rather than dramatized by tangible constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm emerges as micro-setting and final container; its magnetic shift and combustible roses govern tactics (oil thresholds, dome integrity) and anchor the closing image where the flower itself is the preserved shard. Specificity is selective: a brief tour of corridors and soil without tourist cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stakes—preserve memories via escape burn—tighten once as magnetic north completes shift and miniaturization deadline hardens. Agency is K-17’s renunciation of leaving, costing its autonomous form, though pressure arrives more through lyric density than explicit choice narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Central theme—nostalgia as active seed, not stasis—emerges through roses converting terror to bloom and the caretaker becoming root. Final rose image reweights all prior fragments without meta-statement, yet the message stays slightly abstract compared to direct lived consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is controlled, syntactic cadence ebbing with the countdown to collapse. Selective POV (“It understood…”, “it felt…”) stays interior without head-hop; vocabulary (“servos hummed with memory fragments”) is android-apt and consistent under poetry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies smoothly from measured reverie to compressed ignition lines. Density is high; almost every sentence carries dual duty (memory + magnetic field). One scaffold loop (“strangely organic box” recurs without new datum) lightly interrupts, but no clarity lost.</comment>

<question>8</question><question>8.9</question><grade>Combining magnetic anomaly, retrograde memories, and android caretaker creates a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ecological apocalypse told as private archive. Miniaturized rose ending feels inevitable in hindsight, original frame not duplicated in known texts, with risk taken in hybrid lyric-science that pays off without obscuring comprehension.</comment>
