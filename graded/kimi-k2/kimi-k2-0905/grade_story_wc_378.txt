<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>K-17’s contradictory caretaker/nostalgic impulses are embodied in the merging box and final rooting; the micro-choice to open the box and accept the burn reconfigures its identity with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“servos hummed with memory fragments”). The arc earns renunciation of pure order for fused memory-machine existence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: K-17 becomes the seed-core of the miniaturized farm, a crystallized stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—box refusal → merge → burn containment—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass-domed desert rose farm, magnetic field choreography, and the box’s bark-texture all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (android chest plate as soil) functions as setting. Selective sensory detail (“petals vibrating with each degree”) keeps economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the children’s memories vs. execute controlled burn. Pressure tightens when the box resists compression, forcing K-17’s final stance. One meaningful deepening—box grows heavier, whispers multiply—reweights options. Cost is the android’s static self fused into stasis seed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: nostalgia as transformative fire, not preservation. Subtext in the box’s organic pulse vs. metallic chassis. Final image of impossible flower reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity held: memory must burn to survive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to K-17’s perceptual signature (“optical sensors,” “servos hummed”). Syntax mirrors mechanical yet longing mind. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“roses burned blue and gold, their flames writing the children’s names”). Rhythm modulates with magnetic shift urgency. Metaphors precise and consistent; no mixed vehicles. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: android nostalgia fused with botanical apocalypse seed. Magnetic-field roses and memory-box merge feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric miniaturization pays off. No trope recycling; specific lived detail anchors universals.</comment>
