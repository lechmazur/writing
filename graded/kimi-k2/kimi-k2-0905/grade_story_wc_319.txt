<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific, but the guardian’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly alters tactics. The final “curling into snow” reads as stasis rather than earned renunciation, blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden interiorizes her until self and boundary blur, reconfiguring exile into attendance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, cadence shift at end carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frozen garden, mist, and pendant act as micro-setting that constrains movement and recharges final image. Sensory selection mirrors interior dissolution; ice, iron, parchment anchor without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—tightens via iterative waiting and interiorizing. No external antagonist, but pressure deepens through density; cost is the dissolution of self-boundary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as homesickness, waiting as attendance. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature fuses body and garden. No dialogue; prose rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional syntactic excess but pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, vivid figurative language mostly purposeful; minor loops (“interiorizing exteriors” refrain) and elevated diction occasionally blur clarity. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library, exile, and frozen garden; dimensional homesickness as emotional engine feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
