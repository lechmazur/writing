<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—“dimensionally homesick” vs. feral patience—but the final refusal to cross is asserted more than dramatized; no new micro-choice in the last beat means the cost is felt only atmospherically, not as embodied price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer thickens the stake of “befriending uncertainty” until the pendant’s release crystallizes Charged Poise. The causal chain is thin—waiting is the only tactic—but the pattern teaches early and the final image reweights all prior frost, satisfying closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen garden, rosemary scent, copper pendant, and breath-ice are selective, POV-filtered, and directly constrain movement; the warm-scented threshold across the door charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean despite lyric compression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“make friends with uncertainty”—tightens through iterative offering/withdrawing of the pendant; the final refusal forecloses crossing, a visible price under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist, but pressure is coherent and narrows to one irrevocable stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete ritual: knowledge as frozen garden, friendship with uncertainty as refusal to resolve wave/particle. Final image of “expanded boundary of light she now wore like a second fur” reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet consistent—syntax mirrors the guardian’s patient, cataloguing mind; patterned elision (“neither asleep nor awake”) is taught early and paid off in the final threshold beat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences carry double duty (action + metaphor) without scaffold. One mixed vehicle—“breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas that refused to punctuate the night”—slightly strains physics, but figurative muddle never touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Combines feral librarian, photon indeterminacy, and frost-garden into a fresh synthesis; the “interiorizing exteriors” conceit could feel gimmicky yet here drives every image. Risky lyric accumulative structure pays off, making the piece feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
