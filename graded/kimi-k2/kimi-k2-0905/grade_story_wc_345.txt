<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s altruism is embodied in every beat—chilling dew into letters, counterbalancing ladders—yet her interior contradiction (ghostly detachment vs. need for human trust) remains abstract; the final renunciation is earned but cost is diffuse rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s dispersal into the nebula reweights the premise, the cost is the loosening of her tether; causal chain (chalk → ladders → saved arches) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating rock arches and butterfly-wing pigment are not mere scenery—they constrain tactics (ladder chains, seed-fruit wind) and charge the final image; selective sensory detail (violet on tongues) mirrors internal shift without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save orchards or starve—tightens through coordinated harvest; one decisive deepening when frost messages become irreversible pigment; cost is collective labor and Mara’s dissolution, legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective survival emerges from concrete labor and shared grief; final sidewalk inscription offers non-literal answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “brambled hope” that both hurts and sustains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person ghost POV is stable; perceptual signature (condensation at ankles, butterfly-wing dust) is character-specific; no head-hopping; rhythm modulates with pressure—short declaratives during harvest, longer coils at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“clang like berries caught in wire” does triple duty; no mixed metaphors; prose accelerates during ladder choreography then exhales into violet haze; final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Ghost-guided harvest on anti-grav orchard feels inevitable yet fresh; trope of spectral helper is transformed through tactile labor and collective agency; risk in lyric compression pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
