<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s altruistic drive is embodied in every beat—she knocks fruit only when hands wait below, becomes counter-weight where needed—so her interior contradiction (need to be trusted vs. fear of being feared) stays active in scene. The final renunciation of her tether is earned because the colonists’ visible cooperation proves her love has migrated into living muscle. No other character interiority is required; the ghost’s motive arc alone satisfies cost and change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s dispersal into the violet nebula reweights the rule-set—ghost-respite is now a collective resource—cost is the loss of her form, legible in the final “single note of release.” Causal chain holds: each chalk message → human action → arch stability; no off-stage fixes. Orientation is taught early via drifting bodiless POV; disorientation serves the later fusion with nebula, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and anti-grav seeds are not backdrop—they dictate the ladder-chain tactic and the counter-weight role Mara assumes. The watering bell’s bronze timbre tracks emotional temperature across beats, charging the final farewell ring. Butterfly-wing pigment used for the un-erasable message makes setting materially alter communication durability. Environment constrains every tactical choice; specificity is irreplicable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save orchards or starve—is signaled in first third. One meaningful tightening: “one ladder alone tilts the sky” forces cooperative chain, foreclosing solo heroics. Cost is the ghost’s dissolution—visible on page—payable under causal lens. Pressure escalates because each success increases Mara’s expendability, tightening her existential stake in parallel with physical harvest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective survival emerges from concrete labor, not assertion; the final sidewalk line “family is the crop we keep replanting” is spoken by Kai, not the ghost, so thesis is dramatized. Ambiguity lingers: ghosts are still feared elsewhere, but here fear is metabolized into shared ritual. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is in the bell’s ongoing ring and children’s unexplained trust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers at Mara’s perceptual altitude—condensation where ankles should be, butterfly-wing R—creating a ghost-specific idiom without head-hopping. Compression (“brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire”) is patterned early and paid off when the final note is “unbrambled,” showing rhythmic control. No filter-verb stacks; syntax breathes with orchard wind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty: “human ropes swaying above cloud” advances action, image, and stakes in five words. Mixed metaphors are avoided; “brambled hope” recurs with shifting valence, keeping vehicle coherent. Zero paraphrase loops; each chalk line adds new tactical information. Final paragraph slows into gold-warm cadence, releasing tension without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Ghost-as-counter-weight and chalk-messages-via-frost are fresh syntheses that could not swap into another setting without breaking logic. The nebula of respite as grief-processing infrastructure reconfigures familiar afterlife tropes into agricultural-sci-fi ecology. Risk is high—poetic ghost POV, cooperative stakes—but coherence never falters, yielding an inevitable-yet-surprising closure.</comment>
