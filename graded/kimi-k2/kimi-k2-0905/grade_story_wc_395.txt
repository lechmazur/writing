<comment>The keeper’s interiority fuses with the final choice—loss of self vs. refusal to forget—expressed in the hummed lullaby sung at cost. Micro-choices accumulate: finger on crystal, badge pixelation, job evaporating in real time. Embodied contradiction: she sacrifices her paid role as keeper to become a living archive, a clear Earned Stasis under Causal lens. Her mother’s erased presence is not revealed as abstract trauma but felt in the hologram wave that washes over her own identity.</comment>

<comment>A single coherent causal arc: unauthorized access → bargain offered → renunciation → broadcast. The Decisive Change closes on the final upload; the keeper’s palm pressed to Block 73 makes the cost legible immediately. Orientation anchors early with “she scrolled”; time-space remains legible through midnight-tube ride to polar farm. Because/therefore chain holds across 600–800 words without causal amnesia.</comment>

<comment>The archive’s dying-star glow, cold-farm crystal rows, and 73-bpm wind are tactile constraints that re-cue the final song. Scaffolding is tight: the polar cap’s ventilation shafts become literal pipes for pirated broadcasts. Objects—speaker patch, crystal block, badge—are handled under pressure and dissolve into skin-borne numbers serving closure. Spatial logistics remain clear; bodies move without impossible positions.</comment>

<comment>Central stake (uncover erased Aurora passengers) is signaled by line 3 and escalates through each beat—#Aurora73 query → file bargain → memory upload → global broadcast. One decisive tightening occurs at the biometric firewall where refusal costs her agency. Price is felt: losing her name, her paycheck, her own deletion. No coincidence erases the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of corporate erasure vs. public remembrance emerges from choices, never labels. Subtext lies inside static hiss resolving into lullaby; the chord transmutes commercial grief into communal mourning. The final non-literal image of wind throbbing at 73 bpm reweights all prior absence—memory now an on-air phenomenon without moral sermon. Complexity remains: the company persists, but its silence is the cavity that sings.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>POV remains single third-person tight lens; sensory selectivity is cyber-librarian—pixels, timestamps, waveforms. Compression supports momentum: “her name dimming from the payroll” compresses legal deletion without exposition. Voice texture is consistent: technical lexicon (firewall, crawler, server farm) modulates only during lullaby, where rhythm softens toward folk cadence without rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lines layer multitasking: “Coordinates pointed… server farm sang” in one sentence propels plot + atmosphere. No filler loops; even “dying stars” is refreshed by timestamp pulse. Final image “wind hits 73 beats per minute” lands clean, no syntax clutter. Copy hygiene tight—no misplaced modifiers, tense steady.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Concept of data-crash staged for engagement clicks is non-obvious synthesis of influencer economy and dystopian cold case. Patch → lullaby → viral chord progression is transformed use of analog sound in digital dystopia. Risk accepted in making the keeper’s sacrifice literal disappearance, reaped with coherent thematic payoff. Specificity prevents abstractness: Aurora flight uniforms, timestamped tweets, polar vent whistling the tune.</comment>
