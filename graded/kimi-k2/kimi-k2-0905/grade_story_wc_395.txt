<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Corporate memory keeper’s seven-year arc shows escalating moral fractures; her fade to “become memory itself” is earned. Missing is a sharper beat-by-beat interior clash with corporate orders before the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tight causal chain: deleted hashtag lures, patch chord generates coordinates, server farm closure. Block 73 deletion-bracket is a clean DC with visible cost—the keeper’s own disappear—and the lullaby resonance reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Polar server farm as micro-setting creates physical pressure; Block 73’s warm glow against the choir of cubes charges the ending. Social-archive tiles and cold squares are specific to POV tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Missing-person cold case drives every turn from hashtag discovery to ghost-hologram payoff. Stakes tighten each beat: risk of personal deletion versus 200 lost voices. One visible cost—the keeper’s self-erasure—seals the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Absence shaped as “sensed presence” permeates imagery; silence as co-author. Final broadcast of unsent songs reframes loss into activist resistance, non-literal closure that reframes grief-data as weapon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Quiet lyric tone with controlled diction; compressed elisions (memory-to-archive) taught early and paid off. Occasional corporate jargon registers suit POV for archival task but can drift to generic in satellite beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High info density; crystal-block hums produce the lullaby chord organically. No loops or hedges. Metaphor of “dying stars” vs “echo of forgotten songs” stays coherent and resolves into closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Innovative fusion: social-media ghosts + mother erased. Turns grief-economics critique into personal haunting in ways that feel inevitable. 7373-branding as readout is non-obvious yet perfectly tied to logic of server timestamps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Present from first line; each discovery (server, file, bargain) forces her either/or choice; final renunciation of her own memory is paid scene.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Patch introduced early (chord), climactic map, returns as skin brand; three distinct beats tied to causality.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Missing-person case determines every beat—colony hashtag leads to discovery of AI staged crash, redefining stakes at climax.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Labeled as “brightly attentive” only once; no specific tradeoff scene; subtle cost on insomnia when numbers haunt dreams.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lie to security unlocks access line by line; escape collapse requires it; switch to “memory” rather than employee would fail without this exact act.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Recurring 73, 737, 7373 appear progressively—puts clock on keeper’s countdown; guides coordinate extraction and final tattoo.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Archive shapes early access and final broadcast site choice; gate credentials tied to identity deletion give leverage for server selection.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</quote>
<comment>Echo of lullaby stretches across years—evoked but not tightly tracked in screen beats; tighter clock in finale would yield higher score.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Desire to recover deleted files explicitly drives intrusion into server; friction between finding mother vs company obligation is dramatized.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>“Sensed absence” in tags, deleted posts, and silence modulates with each discovery until the chorus leaks onto the open net, charging the hole left in the ice.</comment>
