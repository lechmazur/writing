<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Foresight's embodied choices—melting the wafer into her skin, consenting to be “worn smooth”—drive every beat. Her interiority balances contradictory impulses (instant between past and future) in scene, not summary. A credible renunciation of continuity with visible plant-circuit cost lands the arc. Interior voice is precise without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure is an on-page Conceptual Repricing (CR): the decaying directive becomes a tattooed lullaby of letting go. Causality holds under a hybrid lens—lyric accumulation narrows to transcendence through interpreted dreams. Orientation is anchored by the vine-draped bunker by line 5; no ambiguity aids closure. Persistent constraint (moss rewriting circuits) shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The vine-bunker is handled tactilely twice: its lens floods with lightning and sprouts seeds that braid into rungs. Its corrosion and rewilding pressure choices—metal liquefies where Foresight steps. Micron-setting (her heart as second skin) meets 9+ gate by constraining tactics. Weather and forest track cleanly; no physics amnesia.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—tightens when footprints devour the chooser, forcing consent. One decisive intensification: storm dreams the bunker awake, foreclosing armor. Cost is legible—circuits branch across ribs, fusing person and directive. No coincidence resolves; agency is renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specifics: decay rewrites itself into freedom, not stated. Lullaby edit—“Continuity is letting go in the right order”—offers a resonant non-literal answer to walkers vs paths. Texture (vine-draped ethics) mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Mythic tone embraces complexity without tidy morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice accumulates imagistic cadences; “metal sweat under green fingers” grounds perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is plant-biased. Dialogue is sparse but goal-oriented—storm’s rain whispers “transcend.” Purposeful compression works: final spiral staircase dissolves underfoot with rhythmic calm. Free-indirect style stays coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm shifts with storm pulse—long sentences surge, fragments contract. Zero paraphrase loops; no filter-verb stacks. “A second skin, its circuits branching blue” is specific, embodied. One metadata slip across 400 words: “metal liquifies” (minor typo). High density lines do multiple jobs: decay > lullaby > tattoo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes cyber-forest transcendence myth with non-obvious core (storm walks the walker). Tropes recycled effectively: directive as living virus, rewilding as armor-shedding. Bold choice of let-go stance pays via charged final image. Proximity check: no echo of stock cyber-pastoral scenes. Transformation is earned, not mere ornament.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>She elects twice: melts wafer into skin (keys transcendence) and chooses dissolution into storm. Each choice constrains tactics—metal → soil path, circuit-veins—and carries visible plant fusion cost. Decisions are dramatized, not told.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Seal appears early, warms under dream lightning, then melts into a second skin that charges the ending. Handles transform stakes—code to lullaby—via tactile beats. Swappable only by undermining body-policy fusion and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Decay is only a directive that forgot how to stop giving orders” shapes every tactic—command is literally overgrown. Concept forces the renunciation circle: maintain becomes forget in the right order. Present in language, flesh, and architecture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Playful architecture tilts to keep balance—precise but whimsical—enablesForesight’s safe traverse and plants the motif: bunker undressing itself. Visible tradeoff: safety nets dissolve as she guides its escape.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The act itself—“let the storm walk her like a path”—is the final decisive beat. Transcendence redefines options by surrendering named identity. Could not substitute without breaking thematic engine and ending image spiral.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><question>7.5</question>
<dream mechanics signaled early (“borrowed lightning”), reopen reshaper steal identity. Dream chamber lens floods; mechanics force the wafer seal’s transcendence. Without dream=-logic, wafer warming lacks causal motor.</question>

<question>9 G</question><question>7.7</question>
<vine-bunker is handled: acts as seed cracking, supplies materiel (rungs of rain) and costs (metal corrodes). Micro-setting is causal, not postcard; it governs ascent and ending image.</question>

<question>9 H</question><question>6.9</question>
<storm’s approach is a live clock—footprints devour chooser word by word. Time tracked via seed-sprout minutes and lightning count. Lacks tight beat-for-beat pacing but fulfills temporal pressure.</question>

<question>9 I</question><question>7.4</question>
<phrase “to discover” motivates the quest but is dramatized through dream of footprints choosing her. Tension between desire for answer and consent to being worn smooth yields visible cost: loss of name.</question>

<question>9 J</question><question>8.3</question>
<ethereal grit threads through decaying metal, circuits glowing moss, rain rewriting sky. Tone modulates from rust to crystal rust iron apple; final gritty transcendence is coherent and charged.</question>
