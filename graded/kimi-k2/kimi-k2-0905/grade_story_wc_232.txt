<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for the doorway yet fearing its cost—are embodied in the warm pulse of the matrix chip and the final refusal to step through; the micro-choice to leave the shop unlocked crystallizes his earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the doorway dissolves into the familiar shop, reweighting the promise from escape to acceptance; the matrix chip’s final O/zero marks the irreversible cost of choosing to stay, all under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The 1847 atlas, creek’s rising roar, and bioluminescent cavern are selectively vivid; the matrix chip itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice, charging the ending image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to enter the doorway—tightens once when Elias sees his aged self still searching; the cost of refusal is made legible as the creek swallows the path and he leaves the shop unlocked, foreclosing escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of unmade choices emerges through concrete particulars: the shifting letter on the chip, the mirrored selves, the unlocked door—no moralizing, only the quiet reweighting that loneliness is a daily map redrawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and map-obsessed—“tracing coastlines that no longer existed”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the crawl through granite and slows into the final, charged poise of the unlocked door.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective—“ants like ink on paper”—and no loops or scaffold intrude on the closure beat, keeping the final image crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of antique maps, type-matrix chip, and bioluminescent cavern feels inevitable; the risk of literalizing regret as a physical doorway pays off without gimmickry, yielding a fresh angle on the “road not taken” trope.</comment>
