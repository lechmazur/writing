<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—comfort in dust vs. ache for possibility—is shown early and re-embodied at the threshold. The final step costs the known life; still, the beat-to-beat micro-choices (follow ants, pocket chip, hesitate) are summarized more than dramatized, muting the hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chip → ants → doorway → renunciation of old life. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he physically steps through, creek washes away return. Cost is legible in the last line; lens stays causal throughout. Ant-guide motivation is folkloric shorthand rather than on-page stake, a minor causality thinning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Limestone cliff passage and biolumescent cavern are sketched with selective sensory peaks; the atlas shop’s dust and rising creek anchor time and weather. The matrix chip serves as micro-setting that finally charges the doorway image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial track stays clean; only the ants’ impossible flood-time march strains physical credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—choose possibility over inherited solitude—tightens once, at the doorway. The tightening is clear but single; no secondary reversal or resource lost on page. Price is existential (life forfeited) yet abstract; a tangible object or relationship sacrificed would have sharpened felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of chosen identity vs. ascribed role emerges through marginalia fascination and the final step, never sermonized. The shifting symbol reappears at closure, reweighting earlier map-edge obsession. Ambiguity remains: we don’t know what awaits, preserving complexity. No moral is stated; resonance is image-bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature favors tactile antiquarian detail (yellowed atlases, brass warmth). Syntax lengthens during hesitation, then shortens at step—rhythmic pressure without drumbeat. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“impossible colors”) drifts slightly above Elias’s likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Density is high—each line advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors avoided; “creek… carrying away the old life” is single, coherent. One filter-verb cluster (“he felt a strange warmth”) could be trimmed but does not stall closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Ant-oracle and type-matrix are fresh inflections on the portal-fantasy spine. The inherited-map-shop frame is familiar, but the shifting-letter chip and marginalia obsession particularize Elias. Risk is moderate: follows quest arc yet ends at threshold. Transformation test fails if names change, but marginalia/chip detail would still individuate.</comment>
