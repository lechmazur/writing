<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The caretaker’s contradictory impulses—fleeing upward yet yearning to heal the valley—are dramatized in her body (knees scalloping, palms sealed by sap). Her forgiveness is not declared but performed when she stabs the hairpin to anchor the boy, a micro-choice that fuses grief and agency. The final descent with the relic pulsing inside her shows a credible, earned endurance that forecloses escape and accepts cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fused shell-pin sinks into her sternum, reweighting the valley’s debt into heartbeat currency. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each spiral (moth, shell, hairpin) layers density until the final bell-tone reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact: because she forgives, the boy appears; because she anchors him, the sap seals her lifeline; because she descends, the valley exhales. Cost is legible in the boy’s self-sacrifice and the relic’s permanent residence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moon-ash limb, cloud-crystal shell, and dark sap are not backdrop but tools that constrain action—climbing, fusing, sealing. Sensory hierarchy follows the caretaker’s urgent bias: grape-cooled air, tannin scent, bioluminescent ivy writing names. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and objects track cleanly from grotto to valley gate. The hairpin’s transformation into internal compass charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contentment’s source—tightens when cloudwater shows her future descent; the vision forecloses escape and forces the downward choice. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each spiral image (moth, shell, hairpin) intensifies the cost of forgiveness. The boy’s backward step into air is the visible price that crystallizes her stance. No coincidence resolves; wind shears path, boy dissipates, she pays with permanent relic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular cycle of scallop spirals and fermented sap: rebirth is not ascent but return into the wound. No moral is stated; the valley’s exhalation and coins softening into soil reweight value itself. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing sister’s hand to the moving relic—silently transferring cost. Final lantern-glow grotto image offers charged poise without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to caretaker’s perceptual bias—grape-cooled air, tannin scent, knees scalloping. Syntax mirrors emotional cadence: long liquid sentences climb, short fragments fall. No head-hopping; boy’s interior remains opaque, read only through her senses. Patterned elision (“the cycle demands a death”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective and coherent—spiral, scallop, sap—never muddled. Rhythm breathes with ascent/descent motion. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges lantern motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of vineyard debt, lunar grotto, and scallop fossil feels inevitable yet unseen before. Rebirth as downward climb into fermented forgiveness reverses expected ascension. Risk-taking—boy stepping into wind, relic nesting in bone—heightens meaning without gimmickry. Specificity of “unpaid coins soften into soil” transforms abstract economy into visceral image.</comment>
