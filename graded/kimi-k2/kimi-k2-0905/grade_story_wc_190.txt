<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid, embodied, specific: “pulse drumming through bones.” Nilo’s small micro-choose—easing throttle to model silence—shows hierarchy of silence > scolding. Commuter’s fear crystallized in public silence, but no contradictory impulses or flaws complicate their final surrender; emotional cost is generic, not specific to voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: coherent pressure that crystallizes stance. Ending lands Earned Stasis—“terraced lagged behind its own shadow” and glass now stores fear—felt cost on the page. Orientation taught by motion of drift/cable; no causal reversal beyond commodified confession; stakes deepen but do not decisively change options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Drifting prism terrace,” brass dial, storm glass vial—all reccur with altered meaning and charge the final silence. Weather-craft physics specific (silicon-cable arc). Micro-setting (glass cradle) constrains Nilo’s helm choices and directly enables the fear-exchange ritual, lending the image tangible weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: keeping communal silence vs. admitting fear. Stakes sharpen via the literal 27-20 decibel bar; commuter forced to confess under live monitoring. Tightens once—silence exact price of admission—but escalation is situational crystallization, not causal plot escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reframed silence as collective care: silence grows heavier via storm-glass crystallization. Ending reweights without moral: fear stored, commuter lighter, gondola “tuned to zero.” No overt thesis; resonance in image of crystal lattice cradling words.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, atmospheric voice stable; dense metaphoric compression is intentional pattern. Diction consistent—“vaulting hush,” “fluidly logical cadence”—mirrors Nilo’s obsessive calibration. No register drift or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High compression and low redundancy. “Breathing corridor,” “frozen sigh”—metaphors coherent under sky-transit metaphor. Rhythm serves atmosphere without clogging causality; one minor paraphrase echo (“silence cradle motion” vs “let silence cradle motion”) −0.2. Near flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: weather-science ritualized confession as public transit. Storm glass as confessional booth and commuter data archive repurposes steampunk palette. Commuter’s parental fear lands as small universal under cosmic lens. Risk in minimalist mode pays off.</comment>
