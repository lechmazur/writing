<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sera’s conflicted motives and micro-choices (“felt the letter burn in her sleeve”) are embodied and specific; the moral calculus is dramatized, though a few beats lean on emotive labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A causal chain cleanly threads thaw→letter→upload→sealed pod; the Resonant Reconfiguration lands in the final image (“woman half ice, half fire”) with felt cost under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid, selective (“cryogenic archivist named Sera woke to the dizzying quiet of her echoing library under snow”), and each detail constrains or powers the upload act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus survival—tightens decisively when Sera locks the hatch (“blink that follows surprise”) and broadcasts what cannot be revoked; the cost is on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as civic duty emerges organically; the final aurora over texts rebirth-or-fire image reweights the premise without overt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Vocabulary, cadence, and sensory filtering are coherent and charged; near-lyric density never obscures causality.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Strong line-level craft with varied sentence rhythm, minimal scaffolding; one or two near-redundant phrases (“dizzying quiet deepened as if the library...”) trim a point.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopian vault, but the cryo-archivist as both curate/ anarchist and the contraband letter as live-data coal feel freshly specific.</comment>
