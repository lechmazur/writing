<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mercy’s curiosity and tenderness are embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing the coin, climbing the ladder, pressing it into the tin door—culminating in her acceptance of keeperhood. The spiral cipher and seed packets externalize her internal contradiction between caretaker and inheritor, and the final descent carries visible cost: she seals herself from the surface world. A hairline slip: “uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs” flirts with diagnostic label-speak, but the surrounding embodiment rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain—coin → tapestry cipher → map → trapdoor → cellar—tightens inexorably; each beat forecloses alternatives. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mercy’s decision to stay underground forever reconfigures her identity and forecloses her former life. The cost is legible in the soft metallic kiss of the locking silo door. No orientation drift; the lens is causal and unbroken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The velveteen gloom, marble lamb, glass-roofed silo, and subterranean seed cellar are rendered with selective sensory density that constrains choice: the silo’s ladder and tapestry dictate how Mercy can move and learn. The cobalt tin door’s exact diameter matching the sovereign is a micro-setting detail that literally gates the next beat. Starlight dripping through glass onto the tapestry charges the final image as Mercy descends into lamplight. One minor lapse: “velveteen gloom” edges toward plush cliché, but the surrounding texture redeems it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will Mercy discover what the dead intend before dawn pruning?—escalates as each decoded knot narrows her options. The spiral cipher and map raise the cost of ignorance, forcing her to trade surface freedom for custodianship. Agency is hers: she chooses to dig at the lamb’s feet and descend. A slightly abstract “wager memory” keeps the pressure from being fully visceral, hence not 9+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects: seeds labeled “hope, defiance, return” reweight the spiral from geometry to generational duty. The dead’s wager on memory versus the living’s wager on hours crystallizes without sermon. The final image—Mercy resetting her chess clock to infinite—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: time itself is now her garden. No thematic drift or final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The voice is lush yet precise, its syntax mirroring Mercy’s tender meticulousness: “tenderly organized by moonlight,” “threads rearranging under her touch.” No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Mercy’s sensorium. The diction remains within a gardener’s lexicon even at lyrical peaks. Compression like “geometry of intentions” is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, every sentence advancing image or causality: “starlight drips,” “spiral closes,” “metallic kiss.” No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated phrasing (“uncharted echoes flutter”) flirts with purple but serves the fairy-tale register. Final line cadence is immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of war-time refugee cellar, cemetery chess clock, and spiral cipher feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The sovereign case and tapestry transform from antique props into keys to an inherited moral underground. Specificity—seed packets in grandmother’s hand—grounds the fantastical frame. Risky descent into locked earth pays off with conceptual cost rather than gimmick.</comment>
