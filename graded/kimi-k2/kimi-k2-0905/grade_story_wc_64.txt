<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mercy’s interiority is concrete—her ribs flutter, her fingers tremble—yet the epiphany (“she understands the shape of intentions”) is declared, not dramatized. The renunciation of surface life is credible because the spiral coin and tapestry have physically forced her descent, but the final interior shift is summarized rather than embodied in a last micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mercy accepts sealed exile below the cemetery, cost legible in the metallic kiss above her head. Causal chain holds—coin → cipher → map → rungs—though the war-refugee backstory arrives as a single explanatory packet rather than earned beats. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velveteen gloom, marble lamb, iron rungs, preserved-apple scent—each detail is filtered through Mercy’s gardener eye and constrains her next physical act. The cobalt silo’s skylight literally channels starlight onto the tapestry, guiding her climb; the seed packets in the cellar re-anchor her new vocation. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover the shape of intentions before dawn”—tightens when the spiral coin heats and the map reveals her own family mound. One meaningful escalation: the drawer’s click forecloses surface life; she pays with irreversible descent. Cost is visible (locked hatch, exile among seed packets) and scales to word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the living must curate memory so the dead can outwager oblivion. The spiral migrates from coin to root to seed catalogue, reweighting gardening from caretaking to guardianship without overt thesis. Final image of infinite chess clock crystallizes the wager concept without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at Mercy’s shoulder, diction horticultural and tactile—“tenderly organized,” “loosens soil,” “scent of preserved apples.” Rhythm accelerates with short beats during dig, then settles into quiet cadence below. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and pressure-responsive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—action, atmosphere, and metaphor braided without scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs”) borders on purple but stays within Mercy’s sensorium. No loops or mixed metaphors; prop tracking (coin, tapestry, map, rungs) is exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fuses war-hideout history with cemetery-gardener frame; spiral-as-cipher feels fresh yet inevitable. Risky descent into missile-silo root cellar pays off by literalizing “buried memory.” Specificity of seed-labelled intentions prevents trope drift; removal would collapse the story’s engine.</comment>
