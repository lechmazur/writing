<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—obedient indexer vs. truth-seeker—drives every micro-choice; the wrist-stamp tingle embodies cost. The final decision to invert the index is earned by the prior bruise-reading labour and carries visible professional risk. One flaw: the pulse-listening stamp edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glyph re-maps the city’s erased dry past, foreclosing the Council’s aquatic myth with undeniable archival cost. Causal chain holds—blackout → unscrambled stamp → bruise pattern → street-grid revelation → new ledger—each step narrows options. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded library’s marble floor, kelp-wrapped shelves, and rising waterline actively constrain how Mara can sort cards and force the final ledger choice. The stamp-as-tool and wrist-as-micro-setting both charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: lantern dimming narrows perception to touch and phosphorescent outline.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mara expose the erased past?—tightens when bruise patterns prove systematic suppression. The blackout clock cuts power-dependent options, pushing her toward darkness-required glyph reveal. Cost is legible: professional complicity abandoned, new ledger started in knee-deep water with pumps roaring back—no reset.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from archival violence: classification as colonial erasure. The glyph’s negative space and the inverse ledger make the point without sermon. Final image—cards whispering of dry earth—reweights all prior indexing labour into quiet resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter: “catalogue indexing her” is a character-specific nightmare. Syntax lengthens under water-rising pressure, then fractures into braille-like fragments in darkness. No head-hopping; diction stays within her scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—world, body, concept—without scaffold. Metaphors (“water dripping like slow applause”) are precise, mixed only once (“dappled resolve” is borderline). No loops or filter stacks; final paragraph accelerates into stepped cadence that mirrors surfacing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sunken-library-as-archive-of-erasures is fresh; the stamp’s negative-map twist feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky blackout-required reveal pays off by making darkness an active archive reader. Conceptual integrity holds: the story commits fully to submerged bureaucracy.</comment>
