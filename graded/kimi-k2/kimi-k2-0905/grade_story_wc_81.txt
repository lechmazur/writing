<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—obedience to Council vs hunger for erased truth—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (wrist stamp, card reordering). The final renunciation to “remember” carries visible cost: she pockets the stamp and leaves the only place that still holds the evidence, locking herself into future danger.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the blackout’s darkness literally enables the glyph revelation, and Mara’s ledger rewrite crystallizes a new stance against the city’s false history. Causal chain holds—blackout → stamp reveals map → catalogue re-indexed → personal exile—without off-stage shortcuts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flooded library is not backdrop; rising water, kelp-wrapped shelves, and pressure doors constrain every move and meter the stakes. The stamp’s phosphorescent outline on the water surface turns the micro-setting itself into the map, charging the final image with place-bound meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs sanctioned erasure—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens as each bruised card forecloses the possibility of passive compliance. The blackout’s literal loss of light forces a single decisive turn: extinguish lantern or remain complicit. Cost is felt in the rising water and the irreversible act of rewriting the index.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: every act of indexing is an act of forgetting. The final ledger column “Pre-Submergence Topography” reweights all prior cataloguing as complicity, offering a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the question of who owns history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, yet precise—“water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause” is both sensory and judgmental. Syntax mirrors Mara’s cataloguing mind: nested clauses, controlled anaphora, sudden fragments under stress. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, information-dense, rhythmically varied; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—glyph as negative space, blackout as held breath—never crowding the beats. Final paragraph’s cadence shift (“each step echoing like a newly catalogued truth”) lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The submerged library as memory palace, the stamp as inverse map, and the blackout as enabling darkness synthesize into a fresh angle on archival dystopia. Risky lyric compression pays off: the city’s erased streets reappear as bruised paper, an image that could not be transplanted elsewhere without collapse.</comment>
