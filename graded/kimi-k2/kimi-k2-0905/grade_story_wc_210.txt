<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The single protagonist’s interiority is vivid—the amber bottle pressed to his forehead, ash ink on the next scroll—but the choice to reject resurrection without a clear opposing temptation feels slightly unmotivated. Still, the embodied cost in solitude, “renaming streets aloud” with throat raw, grounds the character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern—lantern build, burn, ash, repeat—is legible. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing rather than a decisive act, yet the cost (‘let the wind teach them to fly’) is unmistakable. Micro turns lack causal glue; pattern coherence carries closure.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative micro-setting works as tool: the shredded ledgers become ink, wire ribs cast whale-bone shadows, and a single reed frame anchors the final image. Physical constraints guide every tactical choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—‘civilization is memory worked until it bears weight’—sustains coherent pressure. The ritual burning of scrolls narrows every option forward under protagonist agency; felt cost is the loss of resurrected company.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory as active, kinetic retort emerges organically from concrete actions—pasting yesterday’s headlines into new bones. Final refrain “let the wind teach them to fly” offers an earned, non-literal answer without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>First-person lyric retains consistent perceptual signature—salt on the tongue, sulfur on the match—as syntax modulates with lantern brightness. Occasional overwritten cadences (‘municipal bylaws for a council of none’) barely register under tight voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Most lines advance story or texture, rhythms breathe, but stray stacked modifiers (‘molasses burning his hands on molasses’) create density muddle inside the climactic beat. Artifact stays mild and doesn’t touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost-town revival through iterative lantern ignition and scroll release—is fresh, not trope. Risk-taking (one-person town-council drafting bylaws to gulls) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</question>
