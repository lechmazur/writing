<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Veyra’s defiant refusal of comfort and steady internal accumulation of memories give strong interior contradiction; the climactic smashing of the amber bottle crystallizes her renunciation with a visible sacrificial cost that closes the path of false answers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The causal chain—memory as resistance tool → mandala invitation → lanterns responding to the bell → breaking the bottle—keeps linkage clean, ends with a decisive alteration that reopens the town’s future, and grounds the cost in the rupture rather than mere imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Select sensory flashes (salt crust, cedar and copper, rain-on-stone scent) anchor place while the paper lanterns themselves migrate from passive backdrop to moving participants, constraining action and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—to prove community is possible without wishes—is signaled early and tightened when bell resonance summons living light; pressure rises not through reversals but through Veyra’s single act that permanently severs the wish-path at palpable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the cumulative refusal of ready answers and externalized working-memory mandala; the inverted amber-bottle reflection reframes the town’s blueprint conceptually without explicit didacticism, leaving resonant ambiguity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Lyrically compressed sentences with selective elision sustain an atmospheric register; interior texture remains distinct, no head-hopping, and the final sensory clang gives rhythmic release without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>High information density packed into compact phrasing; a few metaphors are close to overload near “gears made of seaweed,” but syntax stays varied and the final beat lands cleanly without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>The post-magic-ruin revival conceit feels fresh; instead of wishing back the world, protagonist weaponizes refusal of wishes. The amber bottle’s refusal to yield becomes a conceptual engine rather than a deus-ex-machina.</comment>
