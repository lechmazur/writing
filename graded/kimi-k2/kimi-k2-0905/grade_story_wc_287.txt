<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—illicit gardening vs. municipal obedience—stay active in-scene; the choice to surrender the petal instead of the tool crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. The boy’s silence keeps status dynamics legible without voice convergence. Interiority remains concrete, never drifts into label-speak. Only the “wistfully pragmatic” tag is asserted once rather than dramatized, a hairline slip that keeps her just shy of 9-band integration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara forfeits the gauge-tooth and accepts future exposure so the boy can carry moonlit possibility away—cost is legible in the dropped brass and the clicked lock. Causal chain (theft→entry→gift→exit) holds without teleport or amnesia. Orientation anchors who/where by line 5; no debt applied. One micro-turn—surrendering the petal, not the tool—tightens stakes under Causal lens. Lens holds cleanly to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight constrains visibility and supplies the metaphoric “reflected light” she traffics in; the rooftop garden’s paint-bucket soil and salt-stained stairwell mildew tactically limit her footing and scent-track. Fire escape railing and gutter spatially choreograph the tooth’s fall and future nasturtium root—environment directly charges the closing image. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-driven: gardener notices petal texture before diesel breeze. Meets 9-band gate: setting shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle living proof of sky to a corridor-caged child—signals early and tightens when landlords bolt the door, forcing the tool theft. One meaningful deepening: she swaps the instrumental object (gauge-tooth) for the symbolic one (petal), foreclosing her easiest re-entry path and accepting capture risk. Cost is visible in the clink of abandoned brass. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete gardening paradox—illicit cultivation as moral defiance—never stated outright. Final image of lavender in the boy’s pocket reweights “reflecting light” from literal rooftop to internalized possibility, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost: she stays exposed, he leaves armed. Ambiguity lingers—will the nasturtium survive?—inviting reflection without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; insight grown from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Mara’s perceptual filter—moonlight combs hair, harbor tastes of diesel and starfish—no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and breathes during descent, then compresses on exit, mirroring oar-rhythm. Diction remains within gardener lexicon; “bitting gauge” is the one technical intrusion but justified by theft context. Voice distinctiveness and rhythmic control heighten pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, metaphor—without scaffold: “watering can now empty so it would not betray her with slosh” advances plot, object state, and stakes. Figurative layering is dense yet coherent under moon/oar motif; no mixed vehicles. One paraphrase loop spotted (“rhythm of oars in water” repeated thrice) but pattern-taught early and pays off in boy’s exit cadence, so waived as artifact. Closure image pristine.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fire-gardener who steals a locksmith’s gauge to plant moonlight in basement corridors is a fresh synthesis; transformation test fails if names change, proving specificity. Risk taken in lyric accumulative structure is rewarded by resonant closure. No derivative premise penalty applies. Could edge 9+ with one more irreplaceable detail tying nasturtium root to her own eviction timeline.</comment>
