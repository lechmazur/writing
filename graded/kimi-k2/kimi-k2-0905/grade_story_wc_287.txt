<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—rule-breaking caretaker vs. municipal-fine memorizer—are dramatized in every micro-choice; the final renunciation (dropping the tooth, staying till dawn) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy leaves with “a small reflected moon,” a felt cost to Mara’s solitude. Causal chain (petal→permission→theft→unlock→gift→release) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Harbor moonlight, rusted railing, mildew stairwell, and the rooftop garden all constrain choices and charge the final image; the nasturtium rooting in the gutter is a setting detail that reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—deliver living proof of sky—tightens when the lock blocks access; Mara’s agency (theft, unlocking, gifting petal) escalates pressure and pays a visible price (loss of tool, exposure risk).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of light vs. cages emerges through concrete action; the final image of lavender dust riding wind reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—metaphors like “blade pressed flat against skin,” rhythmic oars refrain—remains consistent; no head-hopping, POV distance stable, compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero loops, figurative language purposeful; “pull, lift, glide” cadence mirrors oars and heartbeat without overwriting. No clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: rooftop guerrilla garden + lock-picking midwife metaphor + child liberation. Risky choices (theft, rooftop trespass) heighten stakes without gimmickry; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
