<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tasting memories, pruning the past, feeding the sprout her blood—each choice rooted in her trait of informal wisdom and escalating the stakes. The final renunciation (stealing the next seed) crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Minor slip: “informally wise” is stated rather than dramatized once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse’s transformation and the officers’ disarming rewire collective memory under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each beat (tasting, planting, pruning, harvesting) tightens the pattern and forecloses the Ministry’s control. Cost is legible in the blood-fed sprout and Marisol’s rooftop vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is no backdrop; its corroded ribs, cracked panes, and ash-laden soil constrain every action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (tasting rust, smelling birthday cakes). The transformed leaves replacing glass reconfigure meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewiring collective memory versus Ministry control—tightens once: the seed sprouts, aromas infiltrate sleep, officers drop torches. Escalation is driven by Marisol’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the blood she feeds the plant and her future risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as an offshoot of decay, rebellion through synaptic taste. Subtext in the fruit’s galaxy-swirl and the officers’ tears avoids moralizing. Final image of plum-colored seeds in pockets reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating from groaning greenhouse to synaptic lullabies. Compression (“prune you back to beauty”) and sensory synesthesia remain legible. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored to Marisol’s perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors (molten lattice, edible scripture) serve atmosphere without clutter. Rhythm shifts under pressure—short clauses at climax, longer lulls for planting. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses culinary magic, synaptic rebellion, and celestial botany into a singular vision. Transformation of rust into stained-glass forgiveness feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (tasting memories, Ministry as taste police) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
