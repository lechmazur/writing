<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marisol’s tasting of rusted glass and her whispered vow give a vivid, embodied entry into her motives; the blood-fed sprout and rooftop exit show a consistent arc of risk-taking self-exposure. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak, and the final image of seeds in officers’ pockets proves her resolve has propagated. The only minor gap: we get no contradictory impulse mid-scene to test her certainty, so the change feels slightly single-note rather than torn. Still, her choices drive every beat and carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse’s transformation and the officers leaving “disarmed” reweight the Ministry’s authority with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—seed stolen → alignment window → plant → scent diffusion → synaptic shift—each step triggered by Marisol’s micro-choices. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when) and the celestial countdown supplies tightening. One small elasticity: the exact mechanism by which aroma rewires entire city synapses is asserted not tested, but the lyric lens lets it pass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop but tool: its broken panes admit the alignment light, its ash from confiscated books becomes soil, its vines later replace glass—environment directly constrains and enables every tactic. Sensory triage is POV-specific (tasting rust, humming to cuts), and spatial choreography stays clean as Marisol kneels, plants, harvests, exits rooftop. Weather/celestial clock is tracked precisely and affects action timing. Final image of copper bones polished by tendrils reuses prior detail with reweighted meaning, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illicitly rewire collective memory before the Ministry stops her—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens via the seven-breath countdown. Each pruning cut narrows her options (blood spent, scent released, exposure inevitable) and escalates social risk when loudspeakers warn of treason. The celestial deadline provides a single meaningful intensification; no reversal is needed under the lyric-causal hybrid lens. Cost is legible: physical blood, certain future pursuit, and the irreversible release of forbidden nostalgia into strangers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty as insurgent remediation of state-imposed amnesia. No character articulates a thesis; meaning accrues through edible scripture vines, confiscated-cookbook ash, and officers waking with “borrowed recollections.” Final image of seeds in pockets reconfigures the premise—rebellion is now self-replicating—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose memories will sprout next, and who controls them? Complexity is embraced, not tidied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance steady yet filters every detail through Marisol’s gustatory cognition—tasting rust, reading wind by bolt-rattle—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax flexes with pressure: long liquid sentences for planting, staccato clauses when seed splits “with a soft pop.” Ministry loudspeakers enter only as “muffled echoes, filtered through chlorophyll,” preserving POV integrity. No head-hopping; every metaphor is gustatory or horticultural, reinforcing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ash from confiscated cookbooks and the dust of shattered memory jars” does triple duty (world-building, sensory, thematic). Rhythm modulates—pre-planting suspense stretches sentences; post-bite memory burst contracts them. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each image advances story or stakes. One hairline slip: “clock hands spinning backward” is a familiar trope, but it occupies only half a line and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synaptic-plasticity insurgency with gustatory horticulture feels inevitable yet fresh; no existing template matches “chef-pruner rewrites city memory via fruit.” Risk-taking is high—lyric compression, magical botany, off-stage mass mind-change—but pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity anchors novelty: monastery-wall plums, confiscated-cookbook ash, copper ribs polished by tendrils. Transformation test fails if names are swapped, confirming authentic vision.</comment>
