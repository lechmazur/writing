<comment>Mira is solid—voice distinct, gait-reading talent tied to action—but internal contradiction stops at curiosity; the stranger’s stakes are generically academic and her coin doesn’t complicate Mira’s identity or choices. Micro-shifts in stance arrive late as mirrored recognition, not active refusal. Closure cost: Mira realizes maps were always incomplete—felt, but not dramatized through an active choice.</comment>

<comment>Frame holds: causal because/therefore chain from storm → GPS blackout → walk recognition → key + whisper sequence → chamber doors open. Closure works: chamber reveal reconfigures the labyrinth’s purpose—maps-as-decoy—earning earned stasis for Mira’s professional identity. Orientation is clear; time/space anchors sustained.</comment>

<comment>Port container labyrinth is tactile, odor-rich, and weather-sounding. Metal walls resonate as acoustic shell, constraining Mira’s need for whisper-navigation and finally charging the chamber reveal. Geomagnetic storm is vivid, causally tied—not mere backdrop. Scale stays intimate, micro-settings (rust panel, zodiac etching) function as props.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake signaled in opening: “proof that secrets travel farther when whispered.” Escalates through each beat—GPS failure forces reliance on whisper skill, coin-activated lock raises stakes, climactic harmonic resonance tightens option set. Agency remains mutual; cost is the conceptual realization rather than material forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme (whisper > noise, analog fidelity > digital) emerges implicitly through labyrinthine acoustics and artifact reveal—no declarative slogan. Final constellation of coins and keys charges historical memory, reweighting earlier maps as blinders. Subtext in metallic echo—“secrets cut through”.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is tight, concrete, and micro-attentive—every sentence tracks body, container resonance, and storm pulse. POV disciplined, focalized cleanly; no head-hopping. Rhythmic compression during walk identification and key sequence accelerates momentum. Diction precise, port-worker cadence held.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, propulsive, and information-dense. No scaffold or loop, strong verbs over modifiers. One mixed metaphor in “metallic whisper” noted but minor. No grammar slips, clear causal connectors. Line rhythm breathes with auroral surges.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clandestine network using freight containers as acoustic megaphone during solar storms. Combines noir port noir with antique tech—whisper-cryptography—without gimmick. Specificity in maritime code and 1943 coin weight sells premise. Conceptually fresh while emotionally grounded.</comment>
