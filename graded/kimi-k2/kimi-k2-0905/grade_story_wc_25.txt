<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s embodied expertise (gait-reading, map-creases) and micro-choice to test the whisper challenge crystallize her arc; the final realization that maps are incomplete without sound carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the stranger’s motivation is slightly abstract, nudging the score below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chamber opens, Mira’s worldview reframed under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—storm, coin, key, whisper converge—though the stranger’s arrival edges coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is tactile, resonant, and constrains tactics; storm light and metallic acoustics charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; port-city frame is lightly sketched yet sufficient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the whisper network—tightens via each beat; storm interference raises cost. Agency is Mira’s decision to lead and speak the code; price is her maps’ inadequacy revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: quiet communication outlasts loud tech. Subtext in coin reflections and harmonic resonance avoids moralizing; final image of reweighted maps and coins offers non-literal, resonant answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, sensory, and profession-specific; free indirect style stays clean. Whisper dialogue carries subtext and goal; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with storm intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful. Minor filter verbs (“she realized”) do not stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime espionage, geomagnetic acoustics, and container architecture feels inevitable. Specificity of gait-reading and coin constellation transforms familiar tropes; risk in whisper mechanics pays off.</comment>
