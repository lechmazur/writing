<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen’s contradictory impulses—laughter at prophecy, then urgent ascent—are embodied in her soaked slippers and fever-warm palms. Her micro-choice to step onto the dais crystallizes a value hierarchy (kingdom over self) with visible erasure cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. The final smile earns the Earned Stasis closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crown settles, mirrors crack, and her name returns—felt cost in kingdom-wide memory restoration. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bleeding starlight density increases until it coagulates into crown. Orientation anchored by “cobalt grotto above clouds” within 120 words. No causality breaks; dream-loop causality is self-consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: frost-laced air thins breath, ember stones’ paradoxical warmth forces the final stance. “Cobalt grotto above clouds” and “basalt steps” are selective, purposeful, filtered through queen’s urgency. Micro-setting (obsidian shard) charges the closure image. No static repetition; environment evolves with starlight coagulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—kingdom’s memory of her—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation: each beat tightens as starlight pools thicker, foreclosing retreat. Final choice narrows to burn memory into crown or lose name forever; cost is on-page (mirrors crack). Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as cyclic burden and gift. Subtext in “shared exhale” between selves. Final image—summer nights warming—reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers. Resonance arises from specific particulars (crown, fireflies) rather than abstractions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “lungs with threads of ice,” “coppery air tasting iron.” Perceptual signature is queen’s—selective, urgent. No head-hopping; single POV stable. Compression taught early (“bleeding starlight”) and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density: “frost flowered on her eyelashes” does triple sensory work. Metaphors coherent; no mixed vehicles. No overwriting in peak beats. Sentence rhythm accelerates toward dais step. Clean grammar; pronoun references unambiguous. Final line recharges “shared exhale” motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-loop prophecy as self-warning, starlight as liquid memory, ember grotto as paradoxical forge. Risky lyric structure pays off with coherent closure. Specificity anchors universals; no stock fantasy tropes. Transformation test passed—plot fails if elements swapped. Bold circularity heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
