<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The son’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers brushing markers, the hush settling “over me”—and the final micro-choice (leaving the satchel half-open) crystallizes a credible renunciation with felt cost. Motivation remains consistent: he seeks the calm his father wielded, and every beat circles that need. The only drag is a brief lapse into diagnostic self-awareness (“I realized…”) that slightly dilutes embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist’s act of releasing the money reconfigures the loop from trap to teacher, paying the conceptual cost of relinquishing the past. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each territorial marker and foreign note layers until the final hush reweights meaning. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive early and transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The abandoned circus train is not mere backdrop; its rusted bar rail, mildewed popcorn, and contracting metal constrain movement and mood, culminating in the cooling rails’ lullaby that charges the final image. Micro-setting (the brass trumpet’s mouth, the cracked mirror) doubles as tool and mirror, guiding the protagonist’s choices. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—no cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to escape the spiral—tightens through the accumulation of markers and the final release of the money, a visible forfeiture that narrows options. Pressure grows via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the markers shift from warnings to collective signatures, forcing the protagonist’s contribution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: cycles of abandonment and witness, the value of worthless maps. The foreign notes reprise as “maps of countries that no longer existed,” reweighting the startup’s failed future into elegy without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the half-open satchel speaks louder than any thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “moonlight dripped through holes,” “rust and dusky harmony.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long cadences for reflection, clipped fragments under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the thief’s son’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image, memory, and motion. A few metaphor strings verge on excess (“color of dried blood,” “pressed flowers”) but never obscure causality. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of failed tech-startup, abandoned circus, and exile currency feels fresh and inevitable. The territorial-marker device transforms a familiar post-industrial ruin into a living palimpsest. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final hush.</comment>
