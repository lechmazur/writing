<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the knight’s contradictory desire to both keep and break his oath is dramatized through tactile contact with the seed and the puppet. The final renunciation—planting the seed and removing the helmet—carries visible cost and is earned by prior beats. Minor slip: the genealogy reveal is slightly expository rather than acted upon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse dissolves and the knight steps into a porous night carrying the seed, foreclosing the path of silence. Causal chain—program → spiral → puppet → moth → seed—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the frost etching the visor and the final smile “rusty from disuse.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but agent: mercury roots rewrite the playbill, temperature plummets, walls appear/disappear. The seed-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered; silver leaves “chiming like tiny bells” is both vivid and thematically apt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to capture the shape of possibility”—is tested by each reality shift; the tightening occurs when the puppet offers the seed, forcing a choice between old oath and future growth. Cost is felt in the frost-etched names of deserted comrades. One micro-turn suffices and is cleanly executed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: possibility is the compost of failure. The marionette program, moth, and seed form a quiet triad that reweights the meaning of “performance” from staged duty to cultivated becoming. Final image of dawn “no heraldic banner had ever named” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is knightly (“gauntleted palm,” “steel ones”) filtered through wonder. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during shifts, longer breaths during reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Calen throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“factually mystical”) is voice-motivated and taught early. No loops or scaffold detected; final paragraph cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses chivalric quest with alchemical horticulture in a way that feels inevitable. The puppet carved from the same wood as the sword hilt is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric structure pays off: greenhouse as question, seed as answer. No derivative echoes.</comment>
