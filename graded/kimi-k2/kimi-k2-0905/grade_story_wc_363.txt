<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority vivid (“fingers remembered...”), embodied emotion strong. Arc clear: voice traded for orchard-memory. Closure choice forecloses path with felt price—swallowing amber—tying character to silence, orchard, loom. No therapy-speak or rational tidy-ups. Loss palpable in final mute weaving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands with unmistakable CR: “silence... fully knit” reconfigures entire premise by erasing narrator’s voice. Causal lens holds: puzzle pieces link directly to portal, bead swallowed equals voice surrendered; orchard’s time reversal earned. Each beat tightens until final image freezes choice. Cost crystallized on the page—no causal break, no late-rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard isn’t backdrop; its decay rewound by the loom anchors choice—setting constrains final act. Sensory detail (“cider-scented rot”) filters through spinner’s tactile craft. Portal of impossible distance re-weights prior space. Final weaving into orchard recharges every earlier spatial cue. Micro-setting of amber bead inside puzzle cavity clinches score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the trade of voice for impossible message—clear from line ~4. Escalation is incremental sacrifice: bead extraction → swallowing → muteness; each choice reduces options under causal lens. No coincidence resolves; final re-weaving is earned stasis. Price is visceral and visible on page. Meets lens-specific cost test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme of memory as currency and silence as map emerges organically from every decision; never stated. Subtext woven via loom’s silent gold thread, orchard’s backward-growing trees. Final petal of scarred apple blossom reweights all. No tidy moralizing. Specific resonance lingers without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person close retains tight perceptual signature and consistent diction. Sentence rhythms mirror loom cadence (“shuttle clacked like a second heart”). Non-standard poetic phrasing taught early and sustained; portal’s grammar remains legible. No POV drift or filter-verb fogging peak beats. Voice modulates under pressure without clarity loss.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or paraphrase loops; each sentence advances character, image, or charge. Syntax varies purposefully—“stoically sparkling despite mildew”—without overwriting. Metaphors cohere internally; no broken vehicles. Information density high. Final line “weave without sound” lands clean and resonant without scaffolding. No artifacts in closure beat.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh: message woven into orchard-clock powered by swallowed fossilized memory; concept reframes sacrifice as literal tapestry. Non-obvious integration of jigsaw-as-negative-space swallow. Original inversion of time reversal through silent loom. Feels inevitable in hindsight yet new. Risky compressed lyric sustained and paid off.</question>
