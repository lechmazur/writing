<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spinner’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “remembered the orchard before her mind did,” her muteness is embodied in “lungs working like bellows with no sound,” and her final endurance is earned by prior causality. The contradiction between preserving memory and surrendering voice is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The only slight drag is the abstract “impossible distance” phrase that edges toward label-speak, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinner’s swallowed name and silent weaving crystallize the cost of the bargain. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each puzzle piece, each spindle turn, layers density until the final image reweights the orchard’s silence. Causality is intact: the bead’s placement triggers the portal, the crushed bead seals the loss. No orientation debt; spatial anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s “cider-scented rot,” “lichened trunks,” and “bamboo screen” are selective, sensory, and bias-filtered. The loom and amber bead function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the loom anchors the portal, the bead’s absence forces muteness. The environment evolves—trees grow younger—under the spinner’s silent craft, charging the final image. Only a hairline slip: “stoically sparkling” twice feels slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading voice to carry a message—tightens once: the spinner must decide whether to swallow the bead. The pressure is coherent under Accumulative/Textural escalation; each puzzle piece adds weight until the final gap demands the bead. Cost is visible on-page: muteness, golden sap tears, orchard rewinding. Agency is renunciation rather than active reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s decay and renewal, the ant’s lost wing, the swallowed name—no moralizing. The final image of sap beads “holding a single strand of her quiet gold thread” reweights the premise: memory persists only through perpetual sacrifice. Subtext operates in silence and petal-press. The orchard’s laughter heard by travelers is earned dramatic irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“moon-white bamboo fiber,” “nettle-saw runes”—with rhythmic control that accelerates at the portal beat. POV remains tightly interior; no head-hopping. Compression (“stoically sparkling despite mildew and age”) is taught early and paid off in the final tears. Diction stays within the spinner’s perceptual world; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical. Metaphors are coherent—“raveling silence pulled backward through the eye of a needle.” No loops or scaffold. One minor mixed image: “stoically sparkling tears” edges toward oxymoron but is absorbed by context. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of loom craft, jigsaw portal, and voice-for-memory bargain feels fresh and inevitable. Familiar motifs (orchard, amber) are transformed through tactile specificity and causal stakes. The risk of lyric non-linear structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
