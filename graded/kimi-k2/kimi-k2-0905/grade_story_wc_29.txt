<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chest registers the town’s fracture “as a subsonic tremor,” her lips taste copper during transmission—yet the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized in prior life. The decisive retuning from sine-wave to glacier pops is a credible micro-choice that shows her mentor’s maxim in action, paying visible cost (sweat, dimming lights, SWR needle kissing red). Still, the absence of any on-page relationship or status clash keeps the crucible narrow; she never risks personal exposure beyond equipment strain, so the emotional ceiling is high-solid rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: intercepted alien pulse → charts predict 02:17 skip → moon-photocell trigger → counter-wave → tricksters fold at 02:19 → town exhales. The closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lyra powers down, signs off, and accepts “power plays merely paused,” a foreclosed path with the transmitter still hot and town still divided—cost is felt in her exhausted palm on cooling metal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold paraphrase (“the town slept without whispers…”) is minor; closure untouched.</comment>

<comment>The radio booth’s burnt-solder reek, whining capacitors, and SWR needle are tactile constraints that shape her tuning tactics; the moon clipped to the window acts as a live switch. Sodium quad lights “the color of dried blood” externalize the town’s inflammation without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds—generator cord, turntable arm, window clip all track. Environment charges the final image: dawn “the color of old bone” over the quiet quad, reweighting the prior blood-light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent alien subsonics from weaponizing civic division—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the first probe hits at 01:58, forcing her to abandon certainty and switch to chaotic glacier pops; this narrows her options and risks equipment overload. Cost is legible: lights dim, meter kisses red, and she accepts merely a pause, not victory. No coincidence resolves; escalation is causal under the lens. Persistent constraint—the tower’s antique limits—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: interference as an act of love when practiced with humility. The glacier pops carrier reweights “grit” from industrial noise to cradle, a conceptual repricing earned by prior beats. No moralizing; the final tagline invites reflection without thesis. Subtext lives in the dogs’ sudden silence—an audible sign that manipulation has ceased—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyra’s perceptual signature is consistent: astronomical diction (“ionospheric skip,” “hydrogen line”) filtered through DJ sensibility (“gritty bass line,” “gritty lullaby”). Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments like “Sweat salted her lips” mirror the SWR spike. No head-hopping; distance stays mid-close. The warped-field-recording choice is a sonic metaphor for embracing chaos, voice-motivated and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “velvet migraine pressing behind her eyes” does two jobs—sensory and stakes—in five words. Rhythm varies from long atmospheric sentences to staccato beats (“Lights dimmed; the needle…”). One near-loop—“ghost brawl riding the same air people breathed”—is forgivable; no mixed metaphors or scaffold clusters obscure causality. Final line cadence is earned and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of SETI, community fracture, and pirate-radio counter-music feels fresh and inevitable; the glacier-calving vinyl flip is a risk that pays off emotionally and technically. Specificity—37 Hz threshold, SWR meter, moon-photocell trigger—grounds the speculative premise in lived procedure. The piece could not swap settings without collapse; the radio tower is the only plausible weapon. Risk-taking (chaos-as-signal) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
