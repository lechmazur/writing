<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—trembling fingers, terror masked by hope—and her micro-choice to risk permanent enmity by broadcasting interference is earned. Yet the cosmic tricksters remain off-stage abstractions, so relationship pressure is theoretical rather than crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (“decoding → discovery → interference → exposure”) tightens options until the decisive broadcast turns the ship away. Closure is on-page—Mara’s final transmission costs her safety and reconfigures community stance—though the cost is more asserted than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The cramped station, yellowing charts, and aging mixing board are tactile and purposeful; the charts evolve from passive maps to active proof of manipulation. Micro-setting (headphones vibrating against bone) constrains the final action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—humanity’s capacity for unified resistance—tightens as the eclipse clock counts down. The interference act narrows options to “expose or submit,” with visible stakes (armed militias outside) and conceptual cost (Mara becomes eternal target).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: belief as consumable resource, division as alien tool. The ending’s refusal to play the tricksters’ game offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext lives in static crackle and the silence after the final broadcast.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, textured, and filtered through Mara’s scientific precision—subsonic, orbital corrections, neural manipulation—without jargon overload. Rhythm accelerates under pressure; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: “cosmic voices whispered through static.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, high-density, propulsive. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial tricksters,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly lifts register beyond the POV’s lexicon in peak beats, but no loops or mixed metaphors obscure clarity. Final image crystallizes without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar alien-manipulation trope is refreshed by the subsonic-frequency mechanic and the third-option refusal. Specific detail—Tuesday 3:17 AM bleed, charts behind the water heater—anchors the premise. Risky structural compression (montage-like beats) pays off in coherence.</comment>
