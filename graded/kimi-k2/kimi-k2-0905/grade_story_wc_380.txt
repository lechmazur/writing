<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mael’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory pull between reclaiming memory and fear of its cost is embodied in every micro-choice (feeding the matchbook to the projection). The final renunciation—accepting the whale’s breath as her mother’s lost name—carries visible cost and is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mael’s weightless step into the memory projection reweights the premise—memories migrate into hollows—and ends with her reclaimed name lighting the harbor. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the gravity pocket’s surge and the flowers’ blooming tighten the pattern and exact a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt-crystal chamber, whale’s mirrored eye, and lantern’s horizontal flame are not backdrop but active constraints: the chamber’s time-pooled brine enables the memory projection, the whale’s eye supplies the hollow, the flame marks the cost. Every sensory detail is filtered through Mael’s urgent bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover erased childhood—tightens once: the gravity surge forces Mael to trade her matchbook (future light) to stabilize the memory. The cost is legible; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is not erased but displaced into whatever vessel can bear its weight. The final image—lantern flames as buoys marking where memory has surfaced—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is Mael’s—salt, brine, whale-breath synesthesia. Patterned elision (“a mother’s face smeared into fog”) is taught early and paid off when the projection smears back into coffee-dark motes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—gravity as “fist,” petals as “pixels”—and accelerate with the surge. Final line’s cadence mirrors the harbor’s hush.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The gravity-well-as-memory-hollow concept feels inevitable yet fresh; the whale’s body as archive reframes ecological and personal loss. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>
