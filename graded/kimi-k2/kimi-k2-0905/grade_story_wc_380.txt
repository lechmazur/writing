<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Miren’s single-minded quest to recover her sister’s deleted memories is vivid and embodied; every micro-choice (laying the flowers, whispering the date, releasing the dust) flows from that want. Interiority stays concrete—she “feels herself lifted an inch,” “tasted of iron and forgetting”—never drifting into label-speak. The arc lands in credible renunciation: she accepts that the memories can only orbit, never be held, and converts loss into ballast. The absence of on-page secondary characters keeps relationship pressure off-stage, capping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravity point collapses, memories disperse as sensation, and Miren’s stance crystallizes into lifelong custodianship of an uncloseable absence. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (coffee spiral, salt shadow, lantern circles) layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Causality is internal but coherent: because she lays the flowers on the whale-shadow, therefore the chamber exhales. Cost is legible in the spent pigment and the “gleaming silence” she now carries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dock-side gravity-flaw, salt-crystal chamber, and lantern circles are not backdrop but tactical constraint: the fluctuating gravity literally lifts or sinks her body, forcing the slow dance that positions her at the shadow. Sensory triage is POV-specific—Miren notices “gulls arguing over a dropped fish” rather than tourist vistas. The whale carcass and crystal walls evolve across beats, cracking and dissolving in step with the memory release. Final image—the lantern circle holding a silhouette—recharges every prior light motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the gravity point forms: she can witness but not possess them. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the memories emerge as sensation rather than narrative, foreclosing ownership and forcing her pivot to caretaker. Pressure is textural, not antagonistic, but the cost (flowers crumbling, dust dispersed) is on-page and irreversible. Coincidence (whale beaches exactly here) is allowed under Accumulative lens and does not resolve the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—deleted experience sinks into the world’s hidden folds and can only be tended, not reclaimed—emerges entirely through image and action. The wildflowers’ spent pigment and the lantern silhouette reweight earlier motifs without a summarizing moral. Subtext resides in gesture: releasing dust into “the city’s lungs” makes citizens unwitting carriers of another’s erased life. Final “gleaming silence” offers a charged poise that invites counter-readings (complicity, consolation, both).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Miren’s perceptual signature—coffee-ground spirals, lantern codes, the taste of iron—never ventriloquizing others. Syntax lengthens and breathes during discovery, then compresses at the end (“She lit the first lantern, then the next”) to mimic steadying breath. No dialogue appears; voice is carried by rhythmic, image-rich narration that remains within a dock-worker’s plausible lexicon. Patterned elision (“gravity like broken glass”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry triple duty—action, atmosphere, metaphor—without scaffold: “Its massive body had breached at midnight, crushing three warehouses and scattering the gravity like broken glass.” Figurative language is selective; when it clusters at the climax (“memories emerged like minnows”) the simile is brief and apt. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected; pronoun and tense tracks are clean. Minor overworld phrase—“the world’s rules grow thin”—is earned by prior world-building and does not dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of data-whale, fluctuating gravity, and archival deletion feels inevitable yet unseen before; the whale becomes a living archive whose beaching is a server crash. Coffee-ground divination and salt-crystal memory chambers are fresh without gimmickry because each constrains Miren’s choices. Risk—lyric accumulation instead of plot reversals—pays off when the final lantern circle reconfigures the entire pattern. Removing any one image (wildflowers, gravity pockets, lantern path) collapses the emotional logic.</comment>
