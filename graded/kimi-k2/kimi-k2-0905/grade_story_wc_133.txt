<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction flickers in "Another dawn, another failure" and the clutch-gesture around the amber, but Mara’s decisive action—kneeling to paint, drinking the spring water—is rooted more in inherited awe than interior fracture. Relationship is undercooked: the old woman speaks in lore, not status shifts nor fresh pressure. Micro-choice hierarchy legible but cost mostly atmospheric; sleep is “gift” not forfeiture. No earned stasis because renunciation feels gifted, not fought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-scene mosaic with clear orientation by 70 words, causal beats chain cleanly: rain → shells → shard → vial. Closure via Conceptual Repricing: the “real exchange” reframes insomnia as vigilance. Minor drift: monastery as “broken tooth” is set-up for later re-use but never exploited causally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rain trails and tidal cadence physically steer every footfall; shell spirals and half-drowned monastery window their weight inside the final painting. Texture dense, local: “wet stones gold and crimson” re-anchors place at exit. Scale kept human-scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake = “thresh meaning from experience.” Tightens once: Mara must trade creative failure for legacy-memory, narrowing via the shard. Cost remains more philosophical than visceral—vial of “water… never been touched by war” is symbol, not forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emergent theme of cyclical ruin/renewal arises from shells, pigments, ancestral insects. “Water wars’ aftermath” never sermonized; final image re-prices memory as living organism. No tidy moral; ambiguity left hanging like tide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrism is disciplined: “rain trails that ribboned down the basalt” teaches pattern; no purple swerve. Perceptual signature raw-eyes insomnia holds POV cleanly. Occasional over-figurative pulse (water wars as “defeated army”) survives under earned tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dense two-level sentences, varied cadence: “Paint what the water revealed” cuts like instruction. Few scaffold lines; rhythm breathes with tide retreat/return arc. Minor loop: “Another dawn, another failure” echo is allowed as refrain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wrecked monastery memory-market is fresh angle on post-climate-collapse fiction; shells-to-painting transmutation avoids standard survivor barter. Synthesis makes past/present erosion feel inevitable, avoids gimmickry. Specificity lifts familiar trope.</comment>
