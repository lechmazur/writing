<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embroiderer’s contradictory impulses—secrecy vs exposure—are dramatized in the act of stitching; her micro-choice to reverse the children’s song into death-names crystallizes her values. Interiority is concrete (“thread fibers crackling”). Final renunciation of violence via lullaby carries visible social cost: she remains alone, candle trimmed, sky unfinished.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map’s ignition under the projector lens rewrites the coup in real time, foreclosing bloodshed with conceptual cost—the republic’s survival now depends on her silence. Causal chain holds: each stitch encodes intel → scholars speak freely → map revealed → lieutenant lowers gun. Orientation anchored in first 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cobalt silk matching the dome color, mirrored alcove multiplying candle-flames into “silent galaxies,” and the projector glass plate all constrain tactics: the cloth must be held to flame to reveal hidden vectors. Micro-setting (embroidery hoop, eternal candle) becomes the lever that reconfigures the night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent coup bloodshed—tightens when candle’s permanence is threatened. Single decisive turn: lieutenant’s pistol lowers after embroidery reveals safe houses. Cost is the embroiderer’s anonymity and perpetual vigilance; she begins a new chart, accepting endless responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from reversal of perception: decorative “fool” is sole guardian of truth. Subtext carried in reversed lullaby, candle’s dual role as light and threat. Final image—unfinished sky—reweights premise: vigilance is endless, wisdom must stay disguised.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “cobalt silk the exact shade of the observatory dome” fuses setting and craft. Patterned repetition of “flame from eternal candle” teaches reader to watch for hidden layers. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is the embroiderer’s synesthetic attention to thread and silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence layers image and intel. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“chamber seemed full of silent galaxies”) serve pressure, not ornament. Final line “sky was still unfinished” lands clean, no artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of embroidery espionage with cosmic mapping feels inevitable and fresh. Trope of hidden code is transformed through textile physics and lullaby reversal. Specificity of “cobalt silk,” “mirror alcove,” and “projector lens” anchors universals. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
