<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—seduction by the letter’s beauty versus duty to truth—are dramatized in the tactile moment she “almost understood” Rowan’s lie, then tucks the letter away. The embodied cost is her leap across the platform, shedding inherited glory like the bare rosebush. Interiority stays specific to her historian’s perceptual lens. One minor slip: “心跳 counting options” momentarily breaks POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (petal drop → tile → box → leap) tightens options until the decisive theft forecloses her old allegiance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the letter’s warmth against her ribs reweights the chronicle’s authority. Cost is legible in the torchlight she must evade and the nettles she accepts. Orientation anchors cleanly within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy-curtained arch, loose tile, and semaphore arm constrain every move; the bare rosebush recharges the final image of stripped illusions. Sensory selection (moon-silver, rusted rail, nettles) filters through Elara’s urgent priorities. Spatial choreography is exact: ivy coils, torch arcs, platform distances track. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned myth—tightens when the letter’s beauty seduces her, forcing a visible price (the leap, the nettle roll). One meaningful escalation: from academic desire to physical theft. Coincidence (watchman’s timing) complicates, not resolves. Cost is felt in the torchlight halo she must escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rose’s shedding and the letter’s arrogant gold: beauty weaponized to obscure famine. Final image of “plain paper” margins invites reader annotation, reweighting the chronicle’s authority without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ivy’s “slow green edit” and the station’s silence. Complexity lingers—no tidy absolution for past complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is a precise historian’s lens: “emotionally rational eyes,” “archival correspondence,” “patriotic noise.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during the leap, longer reflection after. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent. One register drift: “心跳” jars; otherwise diction stays within POV bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “ivy punched through skylights” does double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors (“drop of dried blood,” “patient serpents”) stay coherent. Rhythm modulates with tension. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival heist meets post-imperial reckoning. The illuminated letter as dynastic forgery device is specific and non-obvious. Rosebush and semaphore arm feel inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risky quiet ending earns its resonance.</comment>
