<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker’s interior contradiction—clinging to inland silence yet obeying the shard—drives every beat; his salt-lipped dream and final catalog entry embody embodied emotion and micro-choice. Stubbornness is not label-only: it delays descent, then forces surrender with visible cost (ankle-tether, name inscribed). No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A; solo arc earns credible renunciation. Closure choice is earned, but the shift from passive receipt of summons to active keeper could be even sharper under water-pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each surreal image (boulevards of marble, paper-boat conflagration) layers density until the final beam reweights the stake. Closure is on-page Resonant Reconfiguration—brass tentacle + inscribed name = undeniable cost, foreclosing return. Orientation taught early via package/pier; no causality breaks. One scaffold paraphrase (“occupying impossible spaces” repeated) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard, lens-bezel, and coral desk function as micro-settings that constrain choice; the northeast aisle and phosphorescent cracks charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: undertaker notices embalming-salt, marble like headstones, catalogued spines like processional candles. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rusted ladder to silt-boulevard to circulation desk. Environment materially shapes tactics: boats burn cold because oxygen is memory—setting rules stay consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“give rest a permanent address”—is signaled in the note and escalates as unreturned souls accumulate. One meaningful tightening: paper-boat blaze trades personal grief for beam-power, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible—names he once buried now ignite—and persists via brass tether. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: cataloguing the unmoored becomes the undertaker’s own checkout. Final image of backward-burning beacon reweights earlier “distress signals” as invitations, not pleas—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost. No moralizing; irony (he buried others, never himself) is dramatized, not stated. Ambiguity lingers: is the beam comfort or warning?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is mortician-precise: “books breathing underwater,” “interval between heartbeats.” Rhythm accelerates with enjambed clauses during descent, then settles into tidal cadence at desk. No dialogue, so dialect/register bullets N/A; perceptual signature remains consistent. One filter-verb cluster (“he understood then”) slightly dulls peak beat, keeping it sub-9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—image + causality: “lens drank the glow, cracks sealing with phosphorescent scars.” Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay optical/mortuary. One paraphrase loop on “occupying impossible spaces” costs −0.2. Otherwise high density, no scaffold, strong verbs, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of undertaker + drowned library + lighthouse distress is fresh; no template echo. Risk-taking (underwater cold-fire, brass octopus catalog) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specific grief-craft is irreplaceable. Concept commits fully; no retreat to safe metaphor.</comment>
