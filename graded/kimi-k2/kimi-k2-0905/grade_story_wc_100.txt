<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The undertaker’s interiority is vivid—salt on lips, unpaid debt to the dead—but the “inadvertently stubborn” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the brass tentacle cinches his ankle, making the final acceptance feel slightly under-cooked in motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens re-lit, the undertaker eternally tethered. Causal chain from package to catalog to cold fire is tight; cost is the self-catalogued name in his own hand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drowned library is tactile—barnacled marble boulevards, coral desk—yet the lens itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act; every detail feeds the beam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rest for the unmoored—escalates when overdue souls erode foundations; revitalizing the signal costs the undertaker his terrestrial life, a felt price sealed by brass.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of rest as a catalogued address emerges through salt corridors and returned souls; the final image of backward-burning beacon offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is mortician-precise yet oceanic: “books breathing underwater,” “bruised glimmers.” Syntax mirrors the hush between tide and time; no head-hopping, consistent lyric distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“column of chased stillness”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Underwater librarian necropolis feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the broken lighthouse lens repurposed as card-catalog key is a non-obvious synthesis that reweights grief into light.</comment>
