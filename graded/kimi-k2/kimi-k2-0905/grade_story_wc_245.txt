<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"citrus on his tongue," "tremor in the air"—and the ring’s weighting with extinct birds’ consonants shows a micro-choice that alters tactics. The final renunciation (ring emptied into soil) is earned by the spiral of pressure and carries visible cost. Minor deduction for a touch of therapeutic self-labeling near the end ("to navigate uncharted emotional depths").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint’s clearing seals, lines sink like seeds, and the mapmaker carries the new cartography under his skin—cost is unmistakable. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of musical-note density and ring absorption tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is taught early through sensory cues, transitions are clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is more than backdrop—its tightening green walls guide movement, and the clearing’s hush inverts sound to constrain the final act. Micro-setting (ring on finger, soil under fingertips) charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping his own interior—is signaled early and escalates through the ring’s growing weight and the spiral’s tightening notes. One decisive deepening at the stillpoint reweights options: he must become the map. Cost is the ring’s emptiness and the irreversible sealing of the clearing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of mapping emotions as terrain; no explicit statement intrudes. Final image—"quiet blaze inside him kept perfect, fearless time"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and touch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision ("alphabet of the place," "grammar of sorrow and wonder") is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent—blind mapmaker’s synesthetic tasting of frequencies, Braille of sound. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor risk of overwriting in "wet heart of silence," but rhythm supports the lyrical mode and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthetic cartography, ultrasonic forest, and emotional mapping merge into an inevitable whole. Risky lyric structure pays off with coherent closure. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if elements were swapped for generics.</comment>
