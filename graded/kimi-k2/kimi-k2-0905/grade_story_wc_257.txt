<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The jewelry maker’s grief is embodied in tactile micro-choices—folding vellum, placing cranes—yet interiority drifts toward abstract “teaching the dead to bloom” rather than dramatized contradiction. The final renunciation (leaving the observatory) is earned by the origami constellation she leaves behind, carrying visible cost of dissolved stencil and decade of solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the origami constellation reweights grief from preservation to celebration, cost legible in dissolved vellum and departure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each placed figure increases density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s liminal architecture (glass dome, curtains of intention, mechanical orreries) constrains every move; the tattoo stencil dissolving into final origami charges the closing image. Sensory selection stays urgent—candlelight, vellum texture—filtered through maker’s craft-trained attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into forward motion—tightens as each origami placement forecloses the option to keep the daughter frozen in memory. Cost is felt in the dissolved stencil and the irrevocable step through the door. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memorials are “beautiful lies” that reveal the love surviving loss. Final constellation reweights this without moralizing, offering non-literal answer that withering precedes blooming. Subtext resides in paper folds and dissolved ink rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise, lapidary, mourning-craft diction (“genuinely artificial,” “brass and glass”)—held steady under subdued ardor. No dialogue; internal texture coherent. Compression (“subdued ardor manifested in precise folds”) teaches pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers craft detail, grief, and cosmic scale without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (“curtains of intention”) is taught and consistent. Final paragraph crystallizes rhythm and image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of mourning jewelry, soul-tracking observatory, and origami cartography feels inevitable and fresh. The genuinely artificial conceit reframes memorial practice; transformation test passes—story would collapse without these exact elements. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
