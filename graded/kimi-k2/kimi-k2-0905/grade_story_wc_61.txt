<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—rooted sorrow vs. transmission—are dramatized in real time through the gear’s tuning and the final choice to leave it behind; the embodied ache and micro-choice to kneel and press the gear against the beacon crystallize motive with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gear’s rhythm resolves into the garden’s sigh, petals pause, and Kael becomes courier rather than root—cost is the relinquished heirloom and the fracture that never opens; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sonar ping to final widening spiral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nebula garden is not backdrop but active constraint: pollen drags boots, petals stall mid-air to mark the moment of choice, and the beacon cavity provides the literal pivot; micro-setting (gear, beacon) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens when the echo returns sharper, forcing Kael off-path; the deepening is the discovery of the buried beacon, which reframes exile as transmission and costs the inherited gear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: legacy as both anchor and burden, broken by choosing transmission over rooted sorrow; the final spiral image reweights the grandmother’s prophecy without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to hydrogen blossoms and brass teeth; compression like “troubling serenity” and “cool radiance” modulates tone without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “petals of ionized gas drifting across the quiet sigh” layers sight, motion, and sound in one stroke; rhythm accelerates at the gear’s blur and breathes at the suspended petals—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: exile-as-garden-root reframed as signal-relay; the impossible gear ratio and flameless starlight feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
