<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—she both inherits her father’s eyes and rejects his path, a tension that drives every micro-choice. The final grafting act crystallizes her renunciation with visible cost: the canvas fibers bite into her palms, thorns draw blood, and the hybrid rose becomes a living memorial that forecloses vengeance. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hybrid rose rooted where the airbag fell reweights the premise—death becomes continuity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each grafted stem adds density until the final image pulses with felt cost. No causality breaks; every object and memory thread converges in the last beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cracked glass dome, thorny canes, and blood-soaked sand constrain every choice; even the workbench’s proximity guides the grafting sequence. The desert wind and amber sunset charge the final image, turning destruction into purposeful bloom. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform violent legacy into living peace—tightens through each grafting beat. The escalating cost is visceral: torn skin, night-long labor, and the irreversible binding of canvas to stem. Agency remains hers; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the roses’ new coral-cream hues—forgiveness bred through patient tending—never stated outright. The final image of roots pulsing beneath the fallen tower reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and thorns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic compression that mirrors Mira’s careful movements. Sensory detail is filtered through her inherited perceptiveness—blood-bright petals, canvas lines echoing her mother’s hands. No head-hopping; POV remains locked and intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence grafts image to action. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (canvas weave in stem, pulse of roots) are coherent and earned. Syntax breathes with scene tempo—longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments under thorn-prick pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bounty-hunter relic and pacifist botany feels inevitable yet fresh. No genre clichés; the living memorial rose is a specific, irreplicable synthesis. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
