<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—mourning a violent father while grafting his canvas into pacifist roses—plays out in embodied micro-choices (pressing ear to soil, singing nomad songs). The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits vengeance for the slower labor of remembrance, foreclosing the bounty-hunter path. One beat of diagnostic label-speak (“senselessly perceptive eyes”) keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each graft and weave thickens the pattern until the new copper rose reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—canvas fibers inside the stem make the father’s violence inseparable from Mira’s peace-garden, cost felt in the “pulse of roots” she hears. No orientation debt; transitions clean within the single greenhouse scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cracked dome, thorned canes, and canvas weave on the stem are tactile constraints that guide her grafting technique; the desert wind’s rose-and-ruin scent mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Final image of “burnished copper” petals charged with canvas pattern could not be swapped out without breaking the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (workbench, soil patch) functions as crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve her mother’s pacifist legacy against the tower’s violent aftermath—tightens when the sandbag scrap forces Mira to decide: discard or integrate. One meaningful deepening: blood-fed brighter roses reveal that destruction can fertilize peace, narrowing her options to graft, not avenge. Cost legible in the night-long labor and the audible “pulse of roots” where his spirit finally rests.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of continuity-through-chaos emerges from the grafting act itself; no character states it aloud. Final image reconfigures meaning: violence literally inside the stem of a forgiveness rose, offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral. Coral-and-cream petals that “had never existed before” carry conceptual repricing—new colors born of blood-soaked earth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—lines etched into her mother’s hands, tremors felt through palm. Syntax lengthens during calm grafting, compresses at dawn’s “tranquil blaze,” mirroring her fatigue. No head-hopping; diction stays within desert horticulture lexicon. One near-slip: “senselessly perceptive” sounds authorial rather than hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long horticultural sentences breathe, then tighten to “She pressed her ear to the ground.” No loops or synonym churn; each image advances stake or texture. Mixed metaphor risk in “engraved quiet…like diving deep underwater” is saved by the POV’s sensory credibility. High density—every sentence does two jobs of atmosphere and causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic ruin with gentle plant-magic feels fresh; grafting a canvas fragment into living stem transforms standard memorial trope into literal continuity. Risk-taking in the “inculcating plants with values” concept pays off by making the roses genetically encode both parents. Could edge 9+ with sharper world-rule cues for how whispered ethics alter botany.</comment>
