<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marisol’s shift from debunker to truth-hunter is embodied in her tactile handling of the diamond and the deliberate burial of the letters; the cost—shame and copper-taste—is visceral. Interior contradiction pulses when she almost drops the stone, yet her earlier motivation (“excavate truth…even if the shovel cut her own hands”) justifies the final renunciation. The flaw is that her past self appears only as playback, not as active memory she must refute, blurring the internal stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: hanging the diamond turns the orchard into a slow broadcast tower, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—letters → stillpoint → diamond → broadcast—holds without gaps; the Geiger’s silence and the browning apples mark the before/after. One minor slack: the “3:03 a.m.” rule is never tested on-page, so the curse feels partly inherited lore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard’s hex-scarred apples and glassy roots constrain every move; temperature drop guides Marisol to the stillpoint, and the final image of browning fruit under radiation recharges the setting as executioner of lies. Sensory economy is ruthless—radioactive dust, crimson globes, bruised sky—each detail pressures choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate truth at personal cost—tightens when the diamond’s playback forces inventory of her own lies. One decisive turn: she chooses to broadcast rather than possess, narrowing her future to exile under screaming Geiger. Cost is visible in the orchard’s accelerated rot and her copper-mouth shame. No escalation slack.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of Eden: the fruit of knowledge kills the orchard once truth is spoken. Subtext lives in the hexagonal scars—lies literally crystallized in bark. Final image of seeds like glass refracts the central question without moralizing: memory as poison or seed? No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is knife-sharp, tactile, and biased toward the Geiger’s cadence; perceptual signature is Marisol’s trained eye noting hexagonal scars and paper grain. Syntax tightens under pressure—“copper and shame” compresses revulsion. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, stakes, or sensory cue. Metaphors (“Geiger…angry cicada,” “glass seeds”) are precise and non-contradictory. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she began to reassemble”) is forgivable amid high heat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cursed archive-diamond and radioactive Eden synthesize familiar tropes into a singular vision; the orchard as slow-motion printing press is fresh. Risk—turning the climax into a quiet hanging of the diamond—pays off by reconfiguring the entire setting into a truth-amplifier. No derivative echoes.</comment>
