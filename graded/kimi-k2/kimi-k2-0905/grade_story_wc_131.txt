<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his fingers tracing the tape, the scent of lavender water—but the shift from solitary caching to “I will not cache alone” is slightly under-motivated; the girl’s presence is too brief to act as crucible. The contradiction between hiding and revealing is dramatized in micro-choices (sliding fragments through knotholes), yet the final smile feels slightly safe, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the girl’s whispered “I see you” reconfigures Elias’s invisibility into shared stewardship; the cost is the permanent loss of his hidden life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragment’s release tightens the pattern—though the causality of the girl’s arrival is lightly situational rather than strictly because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library’s underside—joists, copper pipes, sapphire emergency glow—constrains every move; the tape fragments act as micro-setting that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is exact: floorboard gaps, pipe chases, the candle’s jitter. One slip: “steam and time couldn’t reach” contradicts the later dust-filled pipe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to be seen—escalates through each released voice; the tightening is the irreversible exposure of his cache. The cost is the forfeiture of his three-year anonymity, felt when the girl’s palm presses the boards. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as communal lantern. Subtext lives in gesture—the girl’s hand on the floorboards—rather than statement. The final image reframes “cache” from solitary hoard to shared inheritance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—methodical, sensory, quietly lyrical. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The compression (“oxide surface flaking like dried blood”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels outside Elias’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances cache, memory, or visibility. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during fragment release, longer breaths during memory floods. One strained metaphor: “ghost of sound” is borderline cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—subterranean librarian archiving voices during blackout—is fresh and fully committed. The synthesis of Lorca’s last reading with a child’s rediscovery feels inevitable. Risk in the lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
