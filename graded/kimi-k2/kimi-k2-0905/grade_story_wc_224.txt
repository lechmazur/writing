<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“mercury-glass skin catching the rising sun”), contradictions act in-scene (renounce power to reclaim home), and the final renunciation is earned with visible cost. Minor slip: “mercury-glass seer” label drifts toward archetype rather than idiosyncratic self.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she relinquishes the stone and her gifts, sealing the town’s freedom. Causal chain—feather guidance, custodian’s bargain, lightning strike—tightens options to this single refusal. Lens (Causal) holds without contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Mountain bookstore’s corridors, basalt walls, and burning shelves constrain every move; the crow feather and stone act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reclaim home without re-enslaving it—tightens when custodian demands re-burial of talents. One decisive escalation: lightning spill frees her to choose renunciation, paying the cost of permanent self-dispossession.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as communal weather, not private weapon. Final image of stone sinking into ground reweights prior motifs without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, imagistic syntax—mirrors the seer’s mirrored perception. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even under surreal pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“titles shift like eels in a sack”) are precise and non-repeating. One minor loop—“buried talents” phrase recurs three times—does not dull closure.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fantastical premise is grounded in specific emotional stakes; the inversion of prophecy as curse feels inevitable. Risky structural gamble—collapsing labyrinth into single road—pays off cleanly.</comment>
