<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. the tooth’s proof—drives every beat; her micro-choice to place the tooth into the constellation jaw crystallizes her arc with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden path, the tooth, and the map reweight all prior missteps; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The secret garden’s mint, iron, and bone-paver sundial constrain her choices and charge the final image; micro-setting (tooth, vertebra dial) functions as setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to honor a life-saving lie—tightens when the changeling offers the constellation map; Elara’s agency reconfigures the moral cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: every fracture, honestly set, becomes a lantern; no moralizing, only the charged image of the pear-fed village.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, and time-stamped; compression and metaphor are pattern-taught early and paid off in the final reprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language serves pressure; rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no artifact touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale tropes are inverted: the changeling as benefactor, the lie as nurture; synthesis feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
