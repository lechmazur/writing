<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile reading of light spectra, the memory of the explosion, the micro-choice to teach the drone calm—yet the apprentice Col remains a cipher, muting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the drone arcs away while Lira’s magnetic calm crystallizes the cost of her endurance; the causal lens holds from fracture to flight with no unmotivated turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mist-coated depot, glass drippers, and rain barrel are not backdrop but tools that constrain repair tactics and charge the final image; every sensory detail is filtered through Lira’s non-visual perception.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten from cracked wing to village-wide delay; the clock of the lifting anchor forces a single, visible trade-off—Lira’s calm for the drone’s fear—escalating under causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the translation of damage into direction. The refractive map fused into the wing offers a non-literal answer—chaos read as balance—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lira’s perceptual signature—reading rainbows by fingertip, timing silica with boiler hush—creates a distinct lyric texture; no POV drift, no head-hopping, voice modulates with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops, no mixed metaphors. “Molten silica drawn from her kiln” marries action and image; rhythm accelerates under the depot clock.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of blind craftswoman, light-reading repair, and empathic drone calibration feels inevitable and fresh; no stock tropes, no derivative echoes, risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
