<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ren’s contradictory impulses—yearning to preserve the quay yet abandoning it—are embodied in micro-choices (cutting his thumb, leaving the door unlocked). The final renunciation of the shell/canvas in the cave carries visible cost and crystallizes his arc. Interiority is specific, salted with memory rather than label-speak. One hairline slip: “intimately aloof” is stated more than dramatized until the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted shell wedged in the fissure reweights the premise—loss is transmuted into hidden permanence. Causal chain (mirror crack → promise → cave → shell → relinquishment) holds without gaps. The Orientation Test is waived; disorientation is taught early and paid off. Cost is legible in the final image: “temporary eternity beating inside his chest like a second heart.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains every move: diesel stench drives departure, crushed shells chime under boots, cave’s mineral breath guides descent. The underground beach and bioluminescent plankton are not backdrop but tools that enable the final act of transference. Micro-setting (the shell) functions as setting-object hybrid. One minor drift: “cathedral veins” edges toward familiar metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve what the wrecking ball will erase—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each beat: mirror erasure → shell preservation → relinquishment. Agency is continuous; each choice (entering cave, copying shell, hiding canvas) narrows options and accrues cost. The final renunciation forecloses return. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of temporary eternity emerges from concrete particulars: the shell’s impossible mural, plankton’s timed flare, the hidden canvas no eye will see. No moralizing; resonance is carried by image. Final reconfiguration—loss becomes clandestine permanence—reweights prior motifs without statement. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation victory or surrender?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured, salt-stained, rhythmic: “gulls screamed like circular saws eating the sky.” Perceptual signature is painterly—color, stroke, reflection—yet restrained. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression (“keys were for people who planned to return”) is purposeful and taught early. Under stress, syntax tightens: “plankton dimmed to embers.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every line advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Strong verbs anchor motion: “wrecking crews,” “salt sweat,” “freckled the cave ceiling.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadence for descent, clipped for climax. Minor flourish “cathedral veins” is the lone near-purple moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—painter enters cave to preserve an already-erased harbor inside a shell—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes (nostalgic artist, magical object) are transformed through sensory specificity and causal rigor. Risky structure (descent into literal dark) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: the act of hiding the copy becomes the true preservation.</comment>
