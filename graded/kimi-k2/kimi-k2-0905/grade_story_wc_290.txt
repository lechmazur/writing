<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s claustrophobia, prudence, and wistful rebellion are embodied in humming sea-shanties, compass-point rituals, and the final step into the circle; the cost—sealed tunnels—pays off her flaw-driven arc cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the key taken, tunnels sealed, dawn replacing starlight. Spatial mutiny taught early, pivot circle drilled on-page, and cost (eternal exile from the underground) is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nexus, cracked glass roof, and compass-point shadow constrain every move; the lavender-overgrown dawn vision recharges the setting as future possibility. Sensory selection (dust wind, iron smell, wet parchment) is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the key—tightens when spatial mutiny forces the choice: enter the circle and lose the tunnels forever. Agency drives escalation; the price (claustrophobia forever buried) is legible on the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of cartographic rebellion against fixed maps emerges through spatial betrayal and the compass rose key; the final image of lavender rails offers a non-literal, wistful answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic modulation under pressure (“low A minor rolling into D major”). Perceptual signature—drafting compass as dowsing rod, starlight arranging into keyhole—remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and figuratively rich without clutter; each sentence advances image or choice. No loops, no mixed metaphors; the final “key knocking softly at her hip” crystallizes cadence and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography, claustrophobia, and spatial mutiny braided into a single mythic quest. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off; the lavender dawn reprise feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
