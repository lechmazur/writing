<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—returning to erase herself yet seeking music in silence—are embodied in her empty-camera ritual; the final click against her own face crystallizes renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is specific and sensorily grounded, though the advisor remains a cipher whose pressure is more atmospheric than interpersonal. Motivation is coherent, but the advisor’s lack of interiority weakens relationship-as-crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unexposed frame becomes the score itself, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each measured silence thickens the texture until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography clean; one meaningful tightening occurs when the pretend shutter-click awakens the harbor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is not backdrop but instrument: halyard taps, hull slaps, diesel-seaweed-bread aroma all become quarter-notes under Elara’s conducting. Micro-setting (camera body, splintered slip wood) constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens through each measured absence; the final click forecloses preservation as an option. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the irreversible exposure of nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as unexposed emulsion, music as carved absence. Subtext lives in gestures and negative space; the final empty camera reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers—silence is both loss and composition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to orchestral crescendo. POV remains tightly anchored to Elara; sign-language dialogue is rendered as fluid choreography rather than translation, preserving silence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught early (“echo of light that had never been fixed”) and paid off. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor elevated diction (“compound aroma”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a silent orchestra scored by absence, memory as unexposed film. Risk-taking (entire plot hinges on negative space) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of harbor sounds and scents anchors the concept; transformation test passed—story would collapse if relocated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</question><grade>The advisor’s sign-language question catalyzes Elara’s reply and later ratifies her composition, but the advisor makes no decision that alters tactics; presence is more guide than agent.</question>
<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Camera appears early, clicked twice mid-story to awaken the harbor, then reappears in the final beat as the literal vessel of unexposed music; removal would gut the closure.</question>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Sign language shapes every exchange, enabling silence as dialogue and forcing Elara to articulate motive through gesture; it is the medium of the score itself.</question>
<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</question><grade>Quiet charisma is stated but never constrains or enables a specific action; label-only with no visible tradeoff.</question>
<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>The pretend shutter-click disrupts the night, jolting cats, ropes, watchman—one clear beat that redefines silence as active material.</question>
<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Mapping silence is introduced early, enacted through measured gaps between sounds, and culminates in the conducted harbor symphony; method is dramatized, not declared.</question>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Harbor supplies every instrument—mast taps, hull slaps, scents—directly shaping the musical tactics; setting is co-composer.</question>
<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>“No one remembers” is thematic backdrop rather than ticking clock; it tightens Elara’s anonymity but does not alter tactical choices on the page.</question>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Desire to translate silence into music is voiced in sign, enacted in every measured absence, and fulfilled in the final unexposed frame; conflicted in renunciation of preservation.</question>
<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Joyful sorrow modulates from nostalgic ache to luminous acceptance, culminating in the looping anthem inside the empty camera; tone is dynamic and charges closure.</question>
