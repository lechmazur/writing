<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The advisor’s mute charisma and single-minded mission are vivid, but he remains more mythic agent than textured person; no interior contradiction or micro-choice ever threatens or complicates his purpose, so the arc is flat. The townspeople’s flickers of response are sketched with lovely specificity (boy smiling at absent cough, woman feeling music in her chest), yet none are individuated enough to serve as crucible or counter-pressure. Because the stakes are purely atmospheric, the required “felt cost” lands as communal wonder rather than personal loss, capping depth at high-band threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: the harbor’s silence is literally re-priced as shared music, the camera sealed empty but humming with stolen grief. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each subtracted noise tightens the cadence until the final chord reconfigures what sound can belong to whom. Orientation is taught lyrically from line one; no causality breaks. Cost is visible in the camera’s sealed darkness and the lingering decay of the note—an earned, weight-bearing exit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor, moonlight, and salt air are not backdrop but active loom: the water becomes “slow-moving sheet music,” masts “tuning forks,” buildings “cello bodies.” The vintage camera’s cracked leather and empty spools evolve from prop to resonator, finally left atop the capstan as charged relic. Spatial choreography is flawless across the counterclockwise circuit. Environment constrains every gesture and charges the final image, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be returned as communal song?—is signaled early and escalates through each subtracted sound, a textbook Accumulative tightening. No antagonist is needed: pressure is the growing vacuum of deleted noise. The final chord forecloses the advisor’s own presence; he dissolves, paying with erasure. Cost is legible, but because the town’s agency is reactive, the beat falls just short of the visceral trade-off required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: unheard grief can be transmuted into shared art once silence is truly listened to. The camera’s empty chamber, the phosphor trails, and the final decaying note form a coherent motif that reweights meaning without moralizing. No thesis is stated; the emotional after-effect is concrete—readers feel the hush teaching them how to listen. Complexity is honored: the gift is also theft, the song is borrowed absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric maintains omniscient distance yet filters every image through the advisor’s tactile, maritime lexicon; perceptual signature is unmistakable. Syntax swells and contracts like tide—long cadences for fog, clipped fragments for deleted coughs—mirroring the accumulative arc. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored to the advisor’s gestures even when townspeople react. Voice is the engine, not ornament, and pays off in the final dissolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances map, music, or emotion. Metaphors are interlocking yet precise—“silver ladders,” “phosphor trail,” “twin turbines powered by evaporated grief”—no mixed vehicles. Information density is extreme yet limpid: “He borrowed the heartbeat from a sleeping watchman” does five jobs in eight words. Rhythm modulates from hush to chord without a single drumbeat monotony, sustaining propulsion to the last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise flips the familiar “mysterious stranger brings music” into “mysterious stranger steals noise to give music,” a non-obvious synthesis. Sailor sign-language invented for pre-horn eras, camera with no film as symphony vault, and moonlit harbor as staff paper are fresh specificities that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is maximal—lyric omniscient, mute protagonist, no dialogue—yet coherence never falters. The piece commits fully to its own logic and leaves the reader hearing silence differently; transformation is complete.</comment>
