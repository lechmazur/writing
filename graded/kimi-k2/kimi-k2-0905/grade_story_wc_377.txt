<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied (“fingertips reading micro-oscillations”); the mute-season choice is a credible renunciation with felt cost. No contradictory impulses in-scene, and the final wordless gift to the boy crystallizes her arc without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sculpture’s glow lingers, reconfiguring wonder’s survival beyond her presence. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten toward the comet’s pass. Cost is visible in the shrinking ice and her emptied pockets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bluff wind, kinetic ribs, and iceberg droplets constrain every adjustment; the sculpture itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and altitude affect stamina and tuning precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightened by the comet’s once-in-seventy-six-years arrival. Agency is calibration, renunciation, and final gift; cost is the ice’s loss and her permanent silence. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image and action: wonder as frequency, silence as resonant cavity. Final image of the boy holding the wedge reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence avoids thematic labels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature in metallurgical and acoustic detail feels character-bound. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for ascent, clipped fragments for calibration. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no loops. “Sweating cold diamonds” and “chordless inhale” are fresh yet exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—kinetic monument tuned by comet to preserve wonder—is non-obvious and fully committed. Risk in wordless climax pays off; synthesis of physics, myth, and emotion feels inevitable. Specificity of bronze wedges and glacier steel anchors the concept.</comment>
