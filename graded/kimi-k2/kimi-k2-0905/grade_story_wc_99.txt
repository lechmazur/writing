<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s interior contradiction—needing to “diffuse the ache” yet fearing speech—drives every micro-choice; the final exhale into lace literalizes embodied cost. Kaede’s three-year silence and slow finger-raise show credible flaw without exposition. Relationship as crucible is subtle: the tutor’s withheld speech presses the pupil toward the final breath-diffusion, altering both. Only the mother’s image feels briefly diagnostic; otherwise motives stay particular and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the teal needle’s pulse reweights all prior regret under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lyric but traceable—each lace instruction tightens options until breath diffuses sorrow into the bonsai, leaving a visible droplet as cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 60 words and hold. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early, paid off in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Black sand, salt-slick driftwood bench, and the clay dish bonsai function as micro-settings that constrain gesture—Kaede can only fold lace on a stable surface, the narrator must exhale over needles. Weather (rain dripping from pine) syncs with cadence shifts. Compass glass clouding and clearing acts as mutable environment charging the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no floating objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—diffuse cerulean regret—signaled in paragraph two. Each lace instruction escalates by narrowing modality: trace, untie, breathe; the third forecloses speech itself. Cost is the droplet transferred to bonsai, color pulsing once before settling. Agency is renunciation rather than declaration, perfectly scaled to lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern: pruning as apology—cutting to let light in—echoed in bonsai, lace holes, and the final teacher’s pulse. No moralizing; the teal moment reweights “unspoken” without naming forgiveness. Subtext resides in silence: Kaede’s finger to lips carries more than any valediction. Final image of horizon blur sea/sky offers conceptual repricing of regret as ordinary beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>First-person perceptual signature is consistent: tide “hissed,” rain “slow piano notes,” compass needle “counting heartbeats the world had forgotten.” Syntax slows with sap-slow tutor, accelerates during knot-untie, mirroring emotional pressure. No dialogue; silence is the voice. Diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon yet achieves lyric density. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence. Figurative language is selective—three sustained metaphors (tide, lace, compass) rather than scattershot. Information density high: “the color inside shifted from bruise-blue to the soft dawn tint that rises just before words form” does triple sensory-conceptual work. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; prose remains lucid at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ghost-ship compass that points to regret rather than north is fresh; lace-as-instruction-manual deepens it. Bonsai tutor trope is elevated by three-year silence and final pruning lesson. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, but coherence holds. Slight deduction for familiar “return to mentor islet” frame; specificity of teal color and breath-diffusion compensates.</comment>
