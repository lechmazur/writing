<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise—"cerulean regret" embodied in breath-stained lace; micro-choice of burying compass in pot crystallizes renunciation. Motivation arc from evasion to apology is earned, cost visible in leaving tree behind. Minor: late arrival of former pupil feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tutor’s stance shifts from isolation to return, lace color the felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of lace stitches, tide, and breath accumulate until meaning reweights. Orientation anchored by tide hiss and ghost ship absence within 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Islet, tide, and bonsai pot function as micro-settings that constrain choices—compass burial site, salt wind dyeing lace. Sensory specificity (cedar scent through eyelets, moonlit veins of thread) is purposeful and filtered through tutor’s regret. Environment actively shapes final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding the color of apology to enable return. Pressure tightens when lace reveals map and tutor must decide to leave tree/compass. Cost is leaving behind his crafted past; agency drives the skiff departure. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of apology-as-color emerges through concrete acts: dyeing lace with breath, burying compass. Subtext in lace pattern—rose, vacancy, rose—carries forgiveness instructions without exposition. Final image of greenhouse trees needing "the right sentence" reweights silence as fertile ground.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is slow, tidal, bonsai-taught: "Grow slower; the tides of remembrance are coming in." Syntax mirrors deliberate restraint; perceptual signature notices needle, thread, salt wind with equal weight. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to tutor’s embodied attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: "salt wind diffuse the scent of old cedar through the eyelets" does triple duty. Rhythm modulates from long tide-like sentences to clipped instructions. No loops or scaffold; every image advances. Metaphors (lace as cardinal) are precise and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bonsai discipline with ghost-ship severance feels fresh; neither trope dominates. Lace-as-map and breath-as-dye transform familiar objects into non-obvious stakes. Specificity of cerulean regret as storm-clearing sky is memorable and irreplicable.</comment>
