<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—guilt, defiance, and opportunism—are embodied in every micro-choice; the bolt-diamond conversion crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The final refusal of unpaid labor lands as earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bolt transmutes debt into diamond, then into oceanic release; cost is legible in blood and forfeited future. Causal chain (hum → glitch → meet → twist → tide calm) holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by porthole and farm within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The farm’s drip-line hose, root-cave pressure, and quartz tiles constrain every crawl and twist; the submarine bolt as micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory selection (copper spores, 42 hertz hum) is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from greenhouse to cliff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmuting shame into restitution—tightens through each beat: glitch text escalates, parallel Liras chorus, pressure spikes in the root-cave. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible in blood and forfeited diamond.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of debt-as-matter emerges from the bolt’s metamorphosis and oceanic release; no moralizing, only charged image. Subtext hums in “u still owe u” and the lullaby dissipation. Final void-stamped constellations reweight premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-bound: “virtuously mischievous grin,” “quantum promise like neon scripture.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; glitch texts retain mechanical otherness without rupturing focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is disciplined to high-pressure beats. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure spikes. No mixed metaphors or register drift; “mycelial lace” and “barometric scars” are precise and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of pyramid-scheme trauma and quantum-fungal alchemy; no genre templates. Risky structural choices (parallel selves, debt-matter physics) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
