<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The janitor’s grief-driven spiritual curiosity is vivid and embodied; his micro-choice to speak to reflections and later leave the dome open crystallizes a believable arc from isolation to openness. Interior contradiction—grief for a planet that “forgot how to look up”—and embodied emotion carry through the vision sequence. The final renunciation (trading the lantern’s external glow for an internal one) lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost. However, the meteor’s “question” is slightly abstract-therapy phrased, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A coherent Accumulative/Textural drive holds: each nightly sweep tightens the image bank inside the lantern until the charcoal fleck offers one decisive vision that reweights the janitor’s stance. Closure (leaving the observatory open, chest re-lamped) presents a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—he will never again carry the lantern’s glow as armor. No causal leaps; every beat escalates attention and memory density. The orientation debt for era and station is paid by the final scientists’ discovery scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station’s dust-mote galaxies, brass instruments, and eventual afterimage constitute a micro-setting that constrains the janitor’s nightly ritual and then reappears charged in closure. Specificity is selective: a cracked yellow shard, warm lens caps. Spatial choreography (“leaving the dome open”) reshapes the world for future meteors. No excess cataloguing—every detail feeds the final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is healing by witnessing fragility; pressure tightens nightly as reflections linger longer, forcing the janitor from sweeping to communion. A single meaningful escalation—the fleck vision—forecloses return to the prior numb routine. Cost (loss of lantern glow, exposure of the chest’s bruise) legible on page. Coincidental luck is absent.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges organically from the janitor’s embodied experience; no statement eclipses the meteor’s song of iron and ice. Subtext accumulates in the lantern’s gradual transparency—vulnerability literally admitting light. The final image (heart-shaped afterimage) reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains clean distance, cosmic diction (“dark dialects of iron and ice”) fitting an obsolete astronomer’s heir. Repetition of “flourishing stillness” becomes a rhythmic mantra rather than monotonous. Syntax breathes with emotional tempo: short clauses during meteor flare, languid stretches during dawn. No head-hops or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; occasional elevated flourishes (“primal elegance of shared orbit”) remain within the cosmic lyric license. Zero loops, synonym churn, or register muddle. One tight mixed metaphor—“reopened chest” could risk sentimental—but the earned grief context carries it.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>A cosmic janitor at an abandoned observatory learning from meteor memory feels fresh; the grandmother’s lantern trope is elevated into a memory-catcher that hoards star sighs. The insight (burning ≠ brave change) arises credibly from the meteor’s autobiography, not late grafted wisdom.</comment>
