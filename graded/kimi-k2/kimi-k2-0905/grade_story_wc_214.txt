<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the janitor's micro-choices (kneeling, speaking to reflections, trading lantern) expose contradictory grief and wonder. Flaw: the renunciation of the lantern itself is told more than dramatized, damping the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—he leaves the station open without the lantern, a charged poise that forecloses future return. Lens is hybrid: situational pressure builds to accumulated reweighting of fragility as strength. One minor debt: trajectory vision is summary more than scenework, so the causality to his final renunciation feels slightly floated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dome’s dust motes, abandoned brass, and telescope aperture double as externalized psyche, constraining every beat; the yellow shard functions as micro-setting that evolves from relic to portal, culminating in the final image of heart-shaped afterglow. Exquisite specificity meets the object-to-theme test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Stake—permission for the universe to confess its fragility—intensifies until the meteor’s own question tightens it: burn or remain. Decision to open the dome and let stars see themselves is agency with cost; price is the loss of the lantern glow, felt though underdramatized by one clause.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from janitor–meteor mirror: vulnerability as necessary atmosphere for light to bruise and still shine. Refrains from overt moralizing; final image of “humming” shard reconfigures the premise without stated lesson. Slight surplus of abstract nouns (“flourishing stillness”) nudges it shy of perfect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice of hush and starlight; diction (“dark dialects of iron and ice”) stays rooted in focalizer’s perceptual universe. Prose rhythms swell and contract with emotional pressure; one stray echo of prior clause (“cosmic janitor… in an obsolete observatory”) is negligible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Sentences layered, no loops, dense sonic patterning; metaphorical traffic is heavy yet precise. Minor echo “cosmic janitor…” is the single scaffold artifact and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Cosmic-janitor conceit, star-reflection confessional, and meteor empathy are unusual syntheses rendered inevitable here. Risky lyric structure pays off with conceptual repricing at the end; no derivative echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
