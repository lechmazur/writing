<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—“wound inside her had begun to taste like metal”—and her micro-choice to plant the second confession beneath the server is earned by prior causality. The contradictory impulse between public exposure and private healing is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Secondary pressure from Elias is minimal but cleanly legible; the final renunciation of labels carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the buried USB and pendant crystallize a new stance—silence as active seed rather than passive wound. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat thickens the garden’s hush until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the refusal to release the second recording to the internet. Orientation is anchored within 120 words and never drifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moss-covered server blade and dripping icicles are not backdrop; they constrain the burial act and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the pendant as lantern) functions as setting when it projects the ant’s shadow onto the mound. Selective sensory detail—honeyed glow, wet earth under palms—guides choice rather than cataloging space. Weather (thaw) evolves causally with the emotional thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—how to heal after public confession—is signaled early and tightened once: release a second, unearned voice or bury it. The tightening is driven by Mira’s agency; she chooses burial, foreclosing viral amplification. Cost is the forfeiture of further public vindication. No coincidence resolves the tension; the arrival of Elias complicates but does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the garden’s reclamation of dead circuitry: growth after collapse. The amber ant—tiny survivor—reprises at closure to reweight the premise: small things endure. Subtext operates in gesture (tablet proffered, USB buried) without moralizing. The final image offers a non-literal answer—shadow of an ant on a mound—rather than a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Mira’s perceptual signature—“honeyed hush,” “taste like metal.” Syntax mirrors her watchful patience: long sentences breathe, then compress under pressure. No head-hopping; Elias’s interiority is implied only through action. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; the tablet proffer carries subtext without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “spores drifted in on the jeans-torn knees” does double sensory work. Metaphors are coherent—icicle drip as Morse, pendant as lantern—and never muddle causality. Final paragraph maintains clarity while elevating cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The abandoned data-center-as-moss-garden premise is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The ant-in-amber motif transforms from heirloom to teaching device without contrivance. Risky lyric compression pays off: the story earns its quiet ending. No derivative templates; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
