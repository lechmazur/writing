<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is richly layered—embodied emotion in “wound inside her tasted like metal,” contradictory impulses in both publishing and burying the clip—but external micro-choices (kneeling, burying drive, silent pact with Elias) charge the Earned Stasis. One audible slip: “watchful dreamer” tag reads meta-diagnostic, not character-earned, a −0.2. Relationships as crucible brief but palpable in the mutual witnessing that crystallizes closure. Overall voice distinct, flaws cost visible, closure coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drives under Accumulative/Tension lens: viral confession → garden sanctuary → joint burial act, each beat stacking density that reweights stakes toward communal stewardship, not fame. Closure—burying the new recording—serves as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost legible: relinquishing internet audience for subterranean intimacy grounds the final image. Transitions unambiguous; pattern taught by ~25 %, meeting Mosaic Track.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Server rack turned moss altar constrains tactic (can bury USB where nothing digital lives) and returns as final projection surface; each rack droplet re-threads the closure image. Spatial anchors vivid by 120 w. Sensory hierarchy tightens under Mira’s fear-dilated perception. Environment is not backdrop; it enforces the renunciation. World rules remain consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the wound’s meaning vs. viral noise—escalates through Mira’s choice to relinquish amplification (USB in soil). Sirens outside act as tightening pressure without resolving conflict; burial is decisive narrowing. Cost palpable: lost exposure traded for germinal silence. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates, does not rescue.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of silence as cultivation, not erasure, arises from actions (planting silence under servers) rather than assertion. Final image reweights ant’s shadow as testament that small survivals outlast collapse—resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in Elias’s mirrored pilgrimage deepens communal dimension. No sermonizing, only embodied cost.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><close>Third-person lyric close third on Mira—honeyed hush, drip cadence—coheres throughout; no POV drift. Distinct perceptual signature (“honeyed hush... spores drifted... jeans-torn”) without overwriting. Compression intentional—every clause layered. Dialogue minimal, gesture subtext rich. Final amber shadow line crystallizes voice and meaning simultaneously.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose propels: high density, rhythm that breathes with tension arcs. One loop of “honeyed hush” earns resonance; no scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided; vehicles stay coherent (icicle drip = tempo). No over-naming; every descriptor carries weight. Minor tic: “taste like metal” slightly cliché, forgiven in context of earned turn.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Transforms viral-confession drama into moss-garden ritual; synthesis feels organic, not gimmick. Fresh angle: healing through deliberate digital burial. Risk-taking (no names, minimal speech) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No known near-echoes. Premise committed fully; conceptual integrity holds.</question>
