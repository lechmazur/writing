<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied guilt and the ash-on-tongue micro-choice crystallize his arc; the interior contradiction between survival and absolution is palpable. Yet the girl remains a cipher, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent, capping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ridge-top spiral drawn in ash delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: the porcelain fracture becomes a lens that projects his scar onto stone, making the cost visible. Causality holds—each reflective beat tightens the spiral until the wind scatters the ash, sealing the bargain’s interest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Granite dish, moonlit ash, and fire-scent ground every beat; the porcelain shard’s fracture literally refracts moonlight to brand Elias’s cheek. Setting is not backdrop but instrument—its thermal memory and lunar angle force the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn private guilt into shareable language—escalates via the ash-to-ink spiral; the tightening is one sustained deepening rather than multiple turns. Cost is the irreversible dispersal of the last fragment of the girl’s tent, paid on the ridge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the spiral: pain translated into a language the wind can carry without burning. No moralizing; the granite spiral’s wet glint is the non-literal answer, reweighting the premise that silence was protection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“moonlit ridge path wound like a silver scar”) and sustained; the voice modulates from hushed to hoarse as Elias speaks. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is firefighter-specific—heat memory, wind vectors, ash taste.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphor density is high yet purposeful; each image (silver scar, porcelain blade, spiral ink) accrues pressure. No loops or scaffold; final line “first word in the forest’s reply” lands clean, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ash flake as ink and the spiral as broadcast language transform familiar grief-ritual tropes into something specific to this fire-scarred man. Risky lyric structure pays off: the moonlit granite becomes both altar and printing press.</comment>
