<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—survivor’s guilt vs. the need to speak—are dramatized in the ash-on-tongue beat and the spiral drawn with tear-ink; each micro-choice costs him skin, salt, visibility. The interior arc from mute carrier to commissioned speaker is earned, not announced, and the final renunciation of secrecy lands with palpable weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral etched in ash-water projects grief outward, foreclosing Elias’s private bargain and opening communal speech. Causal chain holds—ash kept → tasted → dissolved → drawn → left—each step tightening his options under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is visible in the wrist ink that will not wash away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, granite dish, and cracked porcelain operate as micro-setting that literally refracts light onto scar, aligning outer ruin with inner; burn-crust pines and charcoal taste keep the 3-year-old fire causally alive. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5 and never drift; environment constrains the final projection that makes the spiral visible valley-wide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep silence vs. speak grief—tightens when the warmed box forces the ash-tasting beat, a visceral forfeiture of the old bargain. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification (taste, tear-salt, ink) rather than external twists; the cost is the irrevocable scattering of the girl’s last trace, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral’s widening path: pain translated into language becomes communal map rather than private wound. No moralizing—final image of wind teaching pines a “new dialect of loss” reweights prior ash-keeping without stating a thesis; ambiguity lingers in the sprout that may or may not survive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s scarred sensorium; perceptual signature is fire-centric—“tasting charcoal, tasting childhood campfires”—and syntax lengthens into lullaby cadence when grief peaks. No head-hop, no filter-stack; compression (“knees creaking like old shelter roofs”) is voice-motivated and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable—moonlight “pooling,” “thin blade of mercy” slipping through fracture—each figurative turn doing double duty for image and emotional state. No loops, no mixed metaphors; the only risk is occasional lushness (“celestial bodies…lingering in conjunction”) but it pays off by cosmicizing the private bargain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ash-as-ink spiral reframes survivor-grief as cartography for strangers awake at 3 a.m.—a fresh synthesis of fire-rescue trauma and public ritual. While “burden carrier seeks absolution” is familiar, the specific mechanics (porcelain fracture as projector, tear-ink as lexicon) transform trope into singular image.</comment>
