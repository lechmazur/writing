<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—detachment vs. need for real feeling—are embodied in the petal beat; the final porous ache is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete (“vials sewn into the lining,” “pulse lied often and well”). Status tension with the chemist is legible but under-leveraged; no micro-choice from him alters her path. The coat vial crack is a perfect cost cue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV, Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer tightens the emotional density until the final Charged Poise. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift. Closure—“she let it hurt”—is on-page with felt cost and reconfigures her stance irrevocably. One minor ellipsis (why chemist leaves) is acceptable under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amber grotto’s resin scent, fossilized sap pool, and cooling stone constrain her kneeling descent and mirror the thaw inside. Micro-setting (petal, coat vials) doubles as tool and body extension. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The final palm-to-ground beat charges the image with earth’s indifferent hum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will she risk feeling truth? Pressure escalates via scent layers—each client emotion narrows her detachment until fusion is irreversible. Agency is the deliberate press of petal to wrist; cost is the flood of others’ grief and her own complicity. No external coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the premise: insight without empathy is surveillance. Subtext in static crackle and “pulse lied” carries the weight. Final image of cracked vial reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—she is reachable, not redeemed—earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: resin, secrets, static. Syntax tightens under pressure (“breathed in the residue”). No head-hopping; chemist’s dialogue is spare, crackling. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs serve voice. Final cadence slows to crystallize the porous ache.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers scent, emotion, or memory. Metaphors are precise (“scent bloomed like a bruise”). No register drift. High information density: “honeyed regret, sharp with citrus of almost-joy” does triple sensory work. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: emotion-as-commodity distilled into scent that subsumes rather than erases. Trope of memory potion is transformed through half-truth economics and ethical cost. Specificity of “grocery store crying” grounds the concept. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
