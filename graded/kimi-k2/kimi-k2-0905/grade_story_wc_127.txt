<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s detachment cracking under the influx of raw, client-sourced emotion is dramatized rather than summarized, culminating in the petal on her pulse and the vial that “cracked in her coat.” A clear micro-choice—no sampling of own wares, yet deliberately pressing the petal—drives the earned reconfiguration. The cost is on the page: loss of control, the ache of porous empathy. Only the chemist’s dialogue “You’ll feel what they felt. But not why” drifts toward explanatory label-speak; the rest is embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s previous rule-set is conceptually repriced when insight merges with empathy. Accumulative/Textural lens holds steadily; the petal’s expanding scent layers constitute a cadence shift that reweights her empire of lies. Causality is tight: Lira’s deliberate inhale triggers the thaw; no off-stage coincidences resolve anything. Cost is unmistakable: “she let it hurt” marks the lived price on the final page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glotto’s resin air and fossilized sap ground every beat; the petal, coat pockets, and static crackle constrain gesture. Dusk light narrows as Lira kneels—time and terrain directly pressure the moment. Atmosphere charges the closing tableau rather than decorating an abstract theme. One micro slip—“stone cooled to stone” slightly redundant—doesn’t dull the final image’s force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through the deepening scent layers rather than reversals; each emission submerges another illusion and raises empathy’s tangible cost. Lira’s single decisive act—pressing the petal—propels the climax. The felt trade-off is unambiguous: she gains porous truth and loses profitable detachment. Stakes are visceral; no convenient luck intervenes.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: commodified emotion collapses once its purveyor finally tastes real pain. Subtext resides in Lira’s silence when the chemist speaks—not in statements. The closing image—residue of half-truths breathed in—offers a resonant non-moral answer to the question of how insight without empathy is merely surveillance. No explicit thesis breaks surface tension.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays pinned to Lira with perceptual idiosyncrasy (“resin and secrets,” “static crackling in her hair”) yet cleanly tracks emotional descent. Syntax intensifies: short bursts heighten toward the kneel. No head-hopping; minor drift in the chemist’s lines is minimal and functional. Voice coheres with earned lyric compression.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Every line does dual work: description seeds theme while advancing Lira’s sensory unraveling. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses slow into the petal press, then stuttered fragments in collapse. Near-zero loops; one mild echo “half truths … half-said” is forgivable. Final paragraph’s diction—“she let it hurt”—is precise and unadorned, sealing clarity.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The scent-as-data premise reframes the familiar “deal with consequences” arc through fragrance chemistry, turning emotion into volatile compounds. Specificity of counterfeiting grief and rage as bottled vials makes it impossible to swap with any generic dealer. The chemist’s refusal to stay mirrors Lira’s refusal to sell, a fresh synthesis of trope and motive.</question>
