<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alden’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “tranquilly perceptive” stance is dramatized through tactile ritual and soot-stained fingers. The contradiction between his vow of silence and the whispered promise at the climax is earned by the child-ghost’s transfer of weight. Motivation is rooted in regret and covenant, intensifying when the fracture threatens the ghosts’ memory. The final choice carries visible cost: he accepts the burden of holding every unspoken word forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Alden renounces escape and seals the fracture, foreclosing any future release of the words. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ghostly deposit thickens the parchment’s symbolic mass until the final sealing reconfigures the stakes. Causality is tight: the child’s arrival triggers the fracture, the dream forecasts collapse, and the whispered vow repairs both pane and covenant. Cost is legible in the “pressure equal to the desert’s heat pressing against his ribs.”</comment>

<comment>The scorched apiary ruins are not backdrop but crucible: heat, ash, and hive shells constrain every move. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting—its fracture and colors refract both ghosts and choice. Spatial choreography is clean: Alden walks to the “largest hive shell,” places the box, presses the crack. The final scent of clover rising from dead land recharges the setting with earned sensory reversal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the ghosts’ memory—tightens when the fracture appears. Escalation is driven by Alden’s agency: he studies clues, accepts the child’s jar, then chooses to mend rather than flee. One decisive deepening: the dream reveals total loss if he fails. Cost is felt in the “weight Alden carried in his chest” and the irreversible vow that binds him forever.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from silence, memory, and custodianship without moralizing. The covenant’s shift from “chain” to “comb” reweights the premise in the final paragraph. Subtext lives in gesture—the child tilting an invisible jar, the ghosts’ breath “cool as evening dew.” The closing scent of clover offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory can bloom even in wasteland if tended.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Alden’s calm perception. Sensory filtering is character-specific: he notes “ash in spirals that resembled the old hives’ missing bees.” No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Alden. The final whisper breaks his own silence with earned rupture, cadence slowing to match the sealing of the fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no loops. Syntax varies to pace pressure: long accumulative clauses build weight, then short declaratives land the vow. Zero scaffolding; even abstract notions like “tangled covenant” are anchored in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The ghost-beekeeper oasis premise is fresh, synthesizing post-apocalyptic caretaking with spectral apiculture. Transformation test: the story would collapse if the bees, box, or covenant were swapped for generic symbols. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off—the final image of clover scent from dead land reconfigures meaning without gimmickry. Specificity throughout (soot-stained fingers, violet fracture) prevents abstraction.</comment>
