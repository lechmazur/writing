<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—confidence vs uncertainty—are dramatized in the pen’s dry scratch and the floating moment; the final choice to plant spiral-questions shows earned change with visible cost (power drain, gravity slack). Interiority is concrete and embodied, though the mentor’s proverb edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s edit reconfigures the anomaly’s lullaby from mockery to invitation, paying with station power and her own ontological uncertainty. Causal chain holds—wrong seeds → static → anomaly flare → pen vibration → edit → lullaby apology—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Station Lagrange-9, the viewport, recycled air, and the anomaly’s silver flare are vivid, selective, and purpose-driven; the gravitational slack literally lifts Mira mid-edit, constraining her choice. Micro-setting (pen, log-scroll) doubles as setting and tool. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore coherent star-whispers—tightens when the anomaly garbles tomorrow’s coordinates into laughter. One meaningful deepening: the edit costs station power and confirms uncertainty as the only reliable coordinate. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: interpretation as gardening, error as fertilizer, uncertainty as coordinate. The final whispered “I am listening” offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. Subtext lives in the pen’s thirst and the anomaly’s apology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“tasted of recycled air and regret”) is character-specific. Compression and patterned diction (“pre-threshed,” “contingent relationships”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports breath and acceleration. Minor elevation in “cosmos answered with garbled lullabies” is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial linguistics meets quantum gardening, with history-editing via emotional nib. The gravitational anomaly as both antagonist and collaborator is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric causality, dry pen writing absence) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
