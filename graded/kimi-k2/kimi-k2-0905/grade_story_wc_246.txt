<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—confidence vs uncertainty—are alive on the page when she poises the nib and unbends the event; micro-choices and embodied emotion are credible and specific. Relationships under revision (future-child laughter) alter state and cost. Final smile and logged relationship reconfigures meaning with visible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete, avoids label-speak.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly holds; anomaly’s tug and silver flare heighten density, and the unbending of the one event reweights the entire pattern. Closure image (“Interpreter to Cosmos, Editor to Edited”) crystallizes options with undeniable cost while causality remains intact. Pattern taught early, transitions legible. One minor clarity flicker in filaments naming, not causal.</question>

<comment>Station Lagrange-9’s gravitational anomaly constrains choices (bone tug, lights dim, power borrowed) and supplies micro-setting in pen, log-scroll, viewport. Spatial anchors are present: viewport, console, corridor. Environment and objects actively charge the closure image rather than decorate. Economy is maintained; no orientation debt.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Dominant stake is repairing meaning amid anomaly; anomaly itself is antagonist force. Agency drives tightening: Mira’s micro-edits narrow options, pay visible cost (station power, her certainty). No reversal reverses itself; each edit forecloses. Cost is legible: comfort now demands perpetual uncertainty.</question>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme of revision-as-gardening emerges organically from literal act and image, never sermonized. Refusal to state moral keeps ambiguity. Final whispered “I am listening” offers non-literal answer to cosmic lullaby, charging prior error with grace. Subtle transformation of “wrong seeds=early seeds” lands with earned resonance.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose texture is distinctly lyric—densely metaphoric, selective sensory, rhythmic control under pressure. Phrasing like “cosmos answered with garbled lullabies” and “contingency flowed” teaches early and closes cleanly. Diction remains character-bound and precise. No voice slips.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Sentences propel; no synonym churn or scaffold loops detected. High information density (e.g., “pen cooled, its job done, yet she sensed future loops”). Occasional ornamental density (light cones, spider silk filaments) rides atop clear causality—does not obscure meaning but momentarily thickens. Final image crystallizes without figurative muddle.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis grafts editorial logic onto relativistic science fiction—no obvious template matches. Meteoric-iridium pen as emotional transducer, seeds as pre-fertilizer static—details are irreplaceable to premise. Bold risk in non-linear editing mechanics pays off with coherence and cost.</question>
