<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority stays submerged in lyrical evocation; contradiction and specific emotion feel real, but micro-choices are inferred rather than dramatised in the water-dance. The swallowing of the cipher page is an earned, costly act born of prior causality; the child’s echo gives concrete ripple without sentimental neatness. A hairline slip remains: her internal stakes (“calm defiance”) are declared more than performed in muscle-memory beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural—dance steps accumulate density until the spiral rupture reweights the seed’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara rises buoyant, the dice constellation spreading across dark water, with conceptual cost legible—her body now the archive. One small looseness: no prior obstacle or external antagonist narrows options, so escalation reads as deepening, not because/therefore narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken domed space, silt floors, bio-lum journals, rusted weather-vane ribs—all specific, sensory, economically seeded by ~25% of text. Final bubble-rise and moonlit surface reconfigure earlier water motifs into liberation image, tethering setting to closure rather than décor. Spatial choreography through flood locks and spiral shaft remains coherent on re-read; no anchorage lapses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—carry vulnerability to surface as strength—is introduced early and tightened by the ticking spider-web timer. The single escalation beat is the decisive swallow that forecloses safe retrieval of the archive; cost is felt as salt-singing pressure in chest and seed. Agency manifests in renunciation of external rescue—cost visible. Pressure coheres without off-stage resolution; coincidence (floating journals) complicates, does not solve.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>“Vulnerability is not the lock, it is the hinge” emerges not as aphorism but as embodied spiral-dance. The theme of encrypted weakness becoming strength is enacted in each pirouette, final buoyant exhale. No explicit moral—image of seed-become-constellation offers resonant non-literal answer. The motif of dancing ciphers is integrated, not decorative; each beat re-weights prior material rather than labelling it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Lyrical third-person limited is stable, voice-particular, compressed without opacity. Syntax breathes with currents—short staccato bursts at climax, longer undulations when drifting. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows under pressure. Distinct lexicon (“ghost-thrum”, “salt and singing”) maintains perceptual signature. No register drift; any elision is pattern-paid.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Rhythm is propulsive; density high (each sentence often does three jobs). No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Metaphors are consistent—dice as ‘tiny bones agreeing on verdict’, current as waltzing partner—no muddled physical overlaps. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cut test holds. Final line lullaby-code is clean sonic closure; no overwritten final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptography-as-choreography and submerged resistance-science without genre cliché. Conceptual risk (swallowing data page) stays coherent within own rules. Specific detail (“ribcaged weather-vane spider”) prevents abstract fungibility. The transformation arrives in hindsight with inevitability; final constellation lullaby recharges whole pattern. Small genre overlaps (sunken lab, rogue archive) remain personalised through movement and medium.</question>
