<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—vulnerability as both lock and hinge—are embodied in every pirouette and swallowing of the seed; the final bodily encryption is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the swallowed dance reweights the premise that vulnerability must be hidden; the spiral diagram and buoy ascent form a coherent CR with undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drowned lab’s pressure valves and silty corridors constrain every tactical choice; the dice and floating journals act as micro-settings that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from decoding to bodily encryption; the spider-web clock forces a single meaningful deepening, and the cost—swallowing the seed—alters future options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spiral dance and swallowed ink: vulnerability transmuted into unweaponizable strength; the final lullaby constellation offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical compression is taught early (“water itself were her metronome”) and paid off in the final exhalation; perceptual signature remains distinct, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm modulates with pressure—long pirouette sentences vs. clipped buoy trigger—while maintaining clarity; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of dance-encryption, drowned ethics, and bodily cipher feels inevitable and specific; the risk of swallowing data heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar tropes into fresh synthesis.</comment>
