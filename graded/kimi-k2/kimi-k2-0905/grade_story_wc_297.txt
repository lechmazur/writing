<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary’s curiosity and scar-driven method create a credible interior arc; the final choice to tend the flower rather than possess it shows earned renunciation with visible cost (the city’s new pause). Interiority is concrete—‘anxious elation rose in me, a kite string pulled by two storms’—and embodied emotion anchors every beat. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under pressure, though the gardener’s minimal on-page presence limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s stance crystallizes into tending the flower, reconfiguring time from early arrival to ‘right on time’ with felt cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the final constellation of suns. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props or causal amnesia. One minor tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, dusk light, and scar-grown hedge constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—‘leaves were still warm, pulsing like a heart’—and the micro-setting of the palm-hedge becomes the decisive constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant—tightens through each beat: clipping → maze → gardener’s question → tending the flower. Agency is decision/renunciation with visible cost; the city’s new pause forecloses old paths. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase, not causal reversals. One deepening suffices and lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: broken covenant, time reclaimed through shared dreaming. Subtext in gesture—showing palms, hedges bowing—carries meaning without statement. Final image reweights premise non-literally: ‘a constellation of miniature suns’ answers the thematic question without moralizing. Complexity lingers; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and POV-anchored throughout. Compression and elision are taught early (‘root-bound visionary that I am’) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional beats. Diction stays within narrator’s lexicon; rhythm accelerates under pressure. Dialogue is absent but not missed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful—‘sky that no longer pressed but accompanied’—and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor purple in ‘cobalt glade at dusk shimmered with a light that had no sun’ but it serves tone and is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream-maze grown from scars to heal time—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (maze, covenant) are transformed through embodied specificity. Final reconfiguration arises from prior pattern, not late rule change. Risk-taking (lyric density, non-linear dream logic) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
