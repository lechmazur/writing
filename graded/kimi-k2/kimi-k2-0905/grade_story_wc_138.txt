<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vey’s boredom and compulsion are embodied in magnetic hunger and corridor drift; the final renunciation (“I intend to discover”) is earned by centuries of exile and the amulet’s tug. Interior contradiction—longing for ending vs. fear of it—plays out in micro-choices: stepping forward, handing over the curse. Mortal leader’s aurora eyes give brief relational pressure, but Vey’s arc dominates. Cost is felt when darkness folds over him and the corridor brightens, emptier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Vey’s step through the door forecloses immortality’s endless corridor and transfers the amulet’s compulsion to the leader. Causal chain: fragment falls → magnetic tug → shard joins → vision of door → bargain → threshold crossing. Each beat tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is taught early via “crystalline corridors folding back on themselves.” Cost is legible in the final hush deeper than any silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite’s shifting panes and solar flares constrain movement and mood; the wooden door’s plainness charges the final image with unadorned finality. Sensory selection—vermilion plasma, magnetic moans—filters through Vey’s immortal perception. Spatial choreography holds: shards click, procession forms, door appears. Environment guides choice: corridors twist when anchors fail, forcing the threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape from immortal exile vs. fear of unknown darkness. Escalation is one deepening: amulet’s compulsion narrows Vey’s infinite options to a single door. Mortals’ mutiny complicates but does not resolve; Vey’s agency crystallizes in the bargain and step. Cost is the surrender of immortality’s certainty for silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images: endless corridors as eternal exile, darkness as unmarked possibility. Subtext in the whispered “goodbye” and the amulet’s polar hunger. Final silence reweights immortality’s curse without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is darkness liberation or deeper exile?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “Möbius sigh,” “hush between thunder and echo.” Perceptual signature is Vey’s dimensional awareness and tactile boredom. No head-hopping; mortals’ whispers are filtered through Vey’s hearing. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences drift, final lines shorten into silence.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves atmosphere without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs—“licked,” “folded,” “clicked”—and selective modifiers. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise through rhythmic hush. Minor risk of purple in “prismatic escondite shimmered like a bruise,” but it pays off in tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: immortal exile meets cursed pilgrimage inside a living prism. Solar storm as ticking clock, magnetic compulsion as plot engine. Darkness beyond the door feels inevitable yet unmapped. Risk-taking in structure pays off: corridor folds, time peels, silence rings.</comment>
