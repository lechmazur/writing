<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vey’s ennui-driven quest is palpable, but internal contradiction between detachment and magnetic compulsion slips into summary too often. One beat—handing off the amulet to re-anchor the station in wandering—earns a decisive turn, lifting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is decisive: Vey steps through the door, forfeiting eternal corridor exile to find post-goodbye. The drive lens shifts from immortal wandering (Accumulative/Textural → Causal choice), re-configured with visible cost at the final heartbeat click.</comment>

<comment>Hallucinatory corridor optics devolve into backdrop without tactile friction, yet the wooden door in non-space anchors the orthopedic of finality. Specific glass reflections that fold futures become tool-level constraints tipping the score to 8.0.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Spatial mutiny idea tightens stakes only once—anchor failure reroutes the station—thereafter mention remains abstract. Still, the corridor shift forces stance crystallization under solar flux, so mid-band at 7.7.</comment>

<comment>Fear of mortality after goodbye subtly threads the stake: immortality becomes a rehearsal for loss. Theme lands via door into feared darkness rather than explicit statement, satisfying resonance.</comment>

<comment>Elegantly distant third-person sentencing keeps pressure hushed yet magnetic; “Möbius sigh” is perspective-tilted rather than purple. OLRA remains consistent, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm escalates toward boarding and door beats without sonic drumbeat; “crystalline corridors folding” is selective and purposeful. Clear momentum with only minor slippage at “low magnetic moans.”</comment>

<comment>Trope of eternal wanderer feels freshened only by the literal door-out-of-space finale. Closure linkage is crisp, but outside that spin the archetype is recognizable.</question>
<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Vey’s boredom and magnetic pull each drive distinct beats; handing final amulet to anchor leader re-weights station’s wandering under new compulsion. Dialogue with leader sharpens cost: permanence traded for elsewhere.</comment>
<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fragment magnetizes Vey first, merges with second shard, creates door vision, and finally transfers to mortal leader to keep station unanchored. Four beats, each with reweighted function, tightly integrated.</comment>

<comment>Mutiny is declared; only anchor failure forced stance crystallization. It changes options once, earning mid-range, but does not complicate tactics beyond that beat.</comment>
<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Vey’s dimensional awareness shows once—感应floor fold into Möbius—but stays label-only thereafter. Present but not fully leveraged; one beat of pressure lifts to 6.4.</comment>

<comment>Intrigue drives one pivotal beat—choosing to hand amulet to mortals rather than seize station—altering closure path. Causal and non-swappable.</comment>

<comment>Magnetic fields are motive for amulet attraction and solar storm static, but mechanics never wrestle the outcome. Present early and late, one functional link.</comment>

<comment>Crystalline glass walls supply solar-flare reflections that tease future corpses; later glass folds physically alter floor orientation, pushing Vey decision under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Solar storm is word-checkbox (radio crack “goodbye,” flares lick panes) but pulses tie clock during amulet merge; live clock weights final door choice toward 6.8.</comment>

<comment>Boredom-driven desire crystallizes to “after goodbye” quest, dramatized in stepping through door. Interior friction between detachment and final renunciation is articulated and carries on-page cost.</comment>

<comment>Hushed tone modulates from corridor lull to storm percussion; final darkness “soft as a lover’s last breath” compresses to charged silence, completing tone arc.</comment>
