<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—dawn painter seeking night bloom—is embodied in her micro-choices (pinning postcards, lying under branch-rose-window). The final renunciation—leaving the pavilion—earns its cost via the indigo panes she can now paint but abandons. Minor slip: “quietly driven” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each season adds density until the thaw reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes the etched glass letting darkness pass through—felt in the final postcard line. No causality breaks; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Copper-ribbed pavilion, frost on lashes, moonflower scent—selective sensory triangulation anchors POV bias. The branch-rose-window constrains her literal point of view and charges the final mural. Weather evolves causally with plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—tightens as winter melts and moonflowers appear. Agency: she paints the panes, then walks away, foreclosing return. Cost is the pavilion left to vines; pressure deepens once, cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: night bloom as acceptance of shadow. Final image reweights earlier postcards and glass without moralizing. Subtext in “the dark remembers what the day forgets” is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression taught early (“quietly driven need”) and paid off in rhythm of seasonal cadences. Perceptual signature is painterly—color, silhouette, negative space—consistent throughout. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with frost and thaw.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors (moonflower buds “small fists”) are precise; no loops or mixed vehicles. Final line “umbral tenderness of their own unfolding” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—artist learns to paint absence by inhabiting it—feels fresh synthesis of familiar motifs. Transformation test passes: story collapses without Liora’s specific painter logic. Risk in lyric mode heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
