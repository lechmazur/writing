<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s claustrophobia and need to “stretch her lungs” are embodied in every plank-step and silence-taste; the porcelain doll externalizes her internal conflict and the final renunciation carries palpable cost. Interiority stays specific—no therapy-speak—and the micro-choice to release the stored silences is earned by the prior accumulation. The keeper interaction supplies brief but clear status pressure. Minor slip: the father’s oxygen-bottling backstory is told, not dramatized, but it primes rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s release of the silences reweights her relationship to the bunker and her own breath. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence gathered intensifies the pattern until the final membrane-break. Orientation is swift; gravity inversion is taught by line 2. No causality breaks; the hour deadline tightens the final descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is both cathedral and crucible; its planks yield/firm underfoot, directly constraining every step. The inverted garden of dangling roots and the gilded hush are sensuously specific yet filtered through Lira’s bodily fear. The porcelain doll serves as micro-setting that carries weight and silence. Spatial choreography remains coherent across ascent and descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting silences to outgrow claustrophobia—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour limit. Each silence gathered raises the cost of hoarding more, culminating in the choice to release rather than imprison the final silence. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of tasting and releasing silence; no moral is stated. The inversion of gravity literalizes the inversion of containment: the bunker becomes internalized silence, the sky becomes breathable space. Final image of the doll left as “porcelain chrysalis” reweights all prior silences into visible color.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Lira’s synesthetic tasting of silences. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses under membrane pressure, longer cadences during reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains tight third-person limited. Compression (“intangibly tangible”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never opaque; each image does double duty (e.g., “gilded hush thick as honey yet weightless”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates at the membrane passage. Metaphors stay coherent within the inverted-gravity conceit. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she understood then”) is offset by immediate embodied cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of bottling and tasting silences feels fresh; the inversion of gravity and trellis is not mere gimmick but integral to Lira’s arc. Specificity of porcelain doll as chrysalis and silence-vessel transforms a familiar anxiety trope. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence without retreating to exposition.</comment>
