<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s contradictory impulses—yearning for reinvention yet clinging to past selves—are embodied in the molt ritual and the coffee-tin archive; the final choice to co-author resistance with Marin is earned by prior shared risk and costs him his lone-wolf identity. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Minor drift: “lantern-bearer” feels slightly abstract in the last paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral reading nest and blank library card crystallize a new shared stance, foreclosing solitary escape. Causal chain holds—each beat (molt, burning skins, rebuilding shelves, bluffing Rourke) tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library’s iron dust, warped stacks, and roof holes constrain tactics—shelters the molt, hides the stove’s green flame, forces spiral choreography. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The setting evolves: from decay to “sovereign gap,” charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the library from bulldozers—tightens through each beat: molt vulnerability, contraband burn, spiral rebuild, bureaucratic bluff. Agency drives escalation; cost is the old skin and future exposure. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of beauty clawed from anarchy emerges through concrete acts—burning past selves, folding verdicts into cranes—never stated. Final image of “co-conspirator of light” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in shared silence and paper wings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature in “rusted library exhales iron dust” and “words arrive jagged.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during intrusion, longer braids during recitation. No head-hopping; POV stays with Lark, filtering Marin through his senses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “Together they drag warped shelves into a circle” could trim one modifier, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: monthly persona-molt meets prison-library literacy insurgency. Trope inversion—guard becomes conspirator—earned through tactile detail. Risky lyric compression pays off in final moonlit image. Feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
