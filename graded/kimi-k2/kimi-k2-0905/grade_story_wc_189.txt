<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chronicler’s interiority is textured and embodied; her tangential method and tactile attention to tide-pool life reveal contradictory impulses—flight from confrontation vs. longing for reconnection. The jade cicada as inherited pulse anchors her grief and patience, charging the final hand-off with felt cost. Micro-choices (shifting lantern, writing “texture,” offering the carving) all tilt the relationship under pressure. Only slight reserve: the daughter’s interiority is implied rather than dramatized, keeping the crucible slightly one-sided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared warmth of the cicada crystallizes a before/after in their stance without tidy resolution. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (salt, drip, starlight) deepens the stake until the final image reweights it. Causality is sideways, deliberate; no causal leaps. Cost is legible in the erased word, the chill dawn, the erased footprints—time touched only as it disappears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grotto as throat between worlds constrains movement and metaphor; limestone ribs and phosphorescence guide the lantern’s placement and the daughter’s approach. Tide-pool micro-setting—anemone, brittle star, mussel—mirrors negotiation of pain. The jade cicada functions as portable setting, its temperature shift marking relational change. Final image of stone warmed by shared skin charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will reconciliation be possible before dawn—tightens through accumulating texture rather than causal reversals. The pause itself becomes a breathing creature; silence and sideways attention escalate pressure. Agency is renunciation of direct interrogation in favor of shared witness. Cost is the dawn’s chill and the erased footprints—time’s silt layering irreversibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges through concrete particulars: cicada’s seventeen-year sleep, tide’s recession, texture of time as silt. No moralizing; the final non-verbal dawn image reweights the premise. Subtext in gesture—lantern shift, thumb brushing wings—carries apology and acceptance. Ambiguity lingers: conversation resumes but remains tidal, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with tidal cadence and selective sensory hierarchy. “Texture” written and erased, “pause…a creature, breathing” show perceptual signature. No head-hopping; daughter’s arrival is external until shadow merges. Compression taught early (“truth arrived sideways”) and paid off in final oblique dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence layers image and meaning without scaffold. Metaphors (grotto as throat, cicada as stored song) are coherent and grounded. No loops or synonym churn. Final line’s “slippery yet luminous” crystallizes texture without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar estrangement trope is transformed through tidal-pool chronicle and sideways method. Specificity of limestone ribs, brittle star negotiation, and cicada lore creates fresh synthesis. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
