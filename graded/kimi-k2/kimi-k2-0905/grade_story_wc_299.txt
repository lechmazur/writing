<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the grille cloth vs. wanting to hurl it—play out in embodied micro-choices (folding, pocketing, taping it to the dash). The final pivot to the unpaid workshop is earned by the remembered moment of being needed, not applauded, so the path foreclosed (continued self-exile) carries felt cost. Interiority stays concrete and avoids therapy-speak; only the tiniest drift toward “purpose after loss” abstraction keeps it from 9+. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grille cloth re-weighted from relic to battle-flag, the quarry valley now a stage where next chords may sound. Causal chain holds: public humiliation → emotional retreat → cloth-triggered memory → redefined mission → phone call that commits her time. One transition (trailer to phone) is clean; orientation anchored by word 60. Cost is visible—she gives away professional hours she can’t bill, foreclosing isolation. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Diesel-stink trailer, limestone dust, and the frayed mesh itself function as micro-setting that constrains her choices: the clang of the crusher becomes a snare hit she can’t mute until she reclaims sound on her own terms. Sensory triage—diesel, cold glass, gravel crunch—mirrors her narrowed attention. Spatial choreography is tight; the foreman’s boots clomping down the steps mark the only exit. The quarry’s acoustic properties (echo valley) literally reshape the final horn blast into almost-applause, charging closure. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she withstand mockery and still matter—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the chat explodes with laughing emojis. The middle deepening occurs as the crusher’s clang forces arena flashbacks, narrowing her options to flee or re-engage. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she offers the workshop, paying with unpaid labor. Cost is legible—she trades billable inventory hours for uncertain redemption—but the escalation is single-note, keeping it just shy of 8.8+. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: value lies in being needed, not in noise or applause. The grille cloth’s re-pricing from souvenir to pedagogical tool reweights earlier material. Subtext lives in gesture—folding the cloth into a “tiny square” is a private cease-fire. Final image of dump-truck engine braking into “chords” offers non-literal answer: music can be mined from aftermath, no moral attached. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter; the foreman’s dialogue is terse, idiomatic, and status-appropriate. Syntax mirrors stress—long hypotactic memories collapse into paratactic phone call. No head-hopping; psychic distance cleanly shifts from interior fog to external action as she stands. The rhythmic drop into fragment (“a count-in, the quarry itself…”) feels intentional, voice-driven. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and paid off (“echo valley kind that bounces off stone and dies” returns as final horn blast). No scaffold loops or synonym churn; each sentence advances image or decision. One mixed metaphor—“sound wave that drooled into a flat line”—is momentarily slack but doesn’t touch closure. Strong verbs dominate; only minor filter verbs remain. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise feels inevitable yet fresh: ex-roadie inventorying rocks after on-air humiliation fuses two worlds rarely paired. The quarry-as-arena acoustic metaphor is a risk that pays off in the final horn chord. Specific lived detail—orange road-case paint fleck in the weave—grounds originality. Not quite 9 because the redemption-through-teaching arc is familiar, merely re-costumed. </comment>
