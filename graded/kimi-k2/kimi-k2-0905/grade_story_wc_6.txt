<comment>Mara’s contradictory impulse—love for and betrayal by her father—is dramatized in her act of planting his black sand with firefighter gloves. Micro-choices (tying the coin, tamping soil, tracing burned arm) map her slow renunciation of vengeance. The firefighter-daughter archetype is made specific by volcanic relics and verifiable rescue history.</comment>

<comment>Closure hinges on Mara’s Earned Stasis: she refuses to salt the earth, grafts the pine, and crystallizes stakes with the coin’s heartbeat metaphor. Causality is locked—every beat traces to the graft and to fire’s legacy. One-legible-scene arc compresses setup→decision→reconfiguration within 750 words.</comment>

<comment>The obsidian lagoon’s dark mirror and kelp-drift sky echo memory-images; the dune gull cry is an atmospheric beat that pressures the choice. Salt-tolerant pine micro-setting constrains which tree she can graft and serves as living fire-resistant history. Volcanic sand body-memory confronts her with tactile proof.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can scars sing rather than scream—tightens as each beat narrows Mara from patrol speech to the graft, cost rising with lagoon water and coin heartbeat. Renunciation of vengeance carries felt cost: she plants shame rather than erase the father, finale sealed by two-finger salute.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Compassion is not theme-label but tactic: grafting father’s residue shames mending into destructive legacy. The final image (“kelp-drift peace settle inside her ribs”) offers non-literal repricing—anger cools into quiet coexistence rather than triumph. Ethics of fire vs. forest growth crystallize stance without sermon.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect FDNY cadence—short, percussion rhythms under salt wind. Gulls cry echo courtroom gasps. Coin drachma’s foreign lex signals childhood mythography in Crete. The poem-sized compression suits lyric mode; ellipsis around “waiting outside the station” keeps acute POV.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose soaks imagery without padding: “guilty fingerprints cling to her gloves” is compact, sensory. Metaphors (clouds “drift like kelp”) teach early pattern returned at closure. Tight line-level economy—only 2 minor “gulls cried overheads” loop. Loop is warned once, capped at −0.4.</comment>

<comment>Gifting volcanic sand to father’s shame plants firefighter-opposite reversal I have not seen before. Foreign-drilled drachma as dark moon on red orbit gives fresh emblem. Risk in lyric quiet ending colored by cost keeps story from burning-celebration cliché. Subtle but memorable.</comment>
