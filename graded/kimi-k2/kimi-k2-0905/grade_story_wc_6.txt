<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—rage against her father and the need to redeem his legacy—are embodied in every gesture; the grafting of black sand and the coin’s placement crystallize her internal split. Micro-choices (tamping soil, tying the drachma) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final salute is a credible renunciation that carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance crystallizes in the salute and the promise of saplings, foreclosing the path of perpetual anger. Causal linkage holds—each beat (scooping trench, mixing sand, tying coin) flows from the prior. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and salt-tolerant pines are not backdrop; they constrain the graft’s viability and mirror Mara’s cooled-lava scar. The coin against bark becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—gull cry echoing courtroom gasp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can scars sing instead of scream?—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened by the graft’s completion and the coin’s tether. One meaningful deepening: the lagoon’s hiss reframes her father as Icarus, shifting her stance from rage to watchful reconciliation. Cost is felt in the salute’s ambivalence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the graft itself: redemption through contamination. Subtext lives in the coin’s heartbeat against bark and the red-thread flare. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—she will bring saplings, not sand, letting song outlast crackle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature is firefighter-trained—“counting stars like sprinkler heads.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression (“kelp-drift peace”) is taught early and paid off in the closing sky.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density—“grains clung like guilty fingerprints.” Metaphors are coherent and scene-anchored. Rhythm accelerates under memory’s heat, then breathes with lagoon water. No register drift or mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of firefighter and arsonist legacies through ecological graft feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative design heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of the Cretan drachma and volcanic sand resists generic templates.</comment>
