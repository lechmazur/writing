<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vela’s interior contradiction—intellectual rigor vs bodily fragility—is embodied through her brass hand and the card; the final alliance with Caelus earns its cost because earlier duels literally scarred them. Micro-choices (tracing the shadow, extending the mechanical hand) crystallize values under live pressure. Backstory flags are anchored in tangible props and bleed into the present with causal weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal arc advances smoothly from shadow-trace → coded needle pricks → spiral revelation → invitation-into-brook, each beat narrowing options until the final reconfiguration: debate becomes joint expedition. Cost is visceral when Caelus removes the vocoder, exposing scar tissue from prior censorship. Closure lands a Decisive Change without a single plot hole.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sundial’s angles actually constrain Vela’s footwork and the needle placement; the reflecting glass walls reconfigure the duel into communal journey. Micro-setting (brass hand, vocoder, copper card) actively constrains choice rather than wallpaper. Spatial choreography across brook-edge remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Stakes tighten from reputational duel to co-authored revolution of thought; each question parry raises the conceptual ante. The final choice (expose scar and walk the spiral) forfeits prior certainty and burns social credit, making cost legible. No reversals beyond one, appropriate for scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Philosophy of interrogation is dramatized not preached: the hidden overture becomes audible only when listeners allow themselves to be destinations. Final image (brook curling around ankles like answered question) offers resonant reconfiguration without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice modulates between precise academic diction and raw scar-throat rasp, reflecting the duel’s move from abstract to embodied. Sentence texture breathes with the brook’s hush-then-whir, culminating in stripped, vulnerable dialogue. No POV drift; compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every image is selective and information-dense. The synesthetic "glass dissolved behind them, its walls becoming transparent wings" pays off earlier glass reflections without purple flab. Rhythm accelerates instinctively with each parry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conceit of a philosophical duel conducted through sundial shadows and code-cards is wholly fresh; the academy-censorship echoes in Caelus’s literal silenced throat transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking (ending dissolves setting into wingsong) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
