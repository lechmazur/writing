<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy’s contradictory urges—collector vs. delver, rescuer vs. tribute—are dramatized in every beat; the final surrender of the compass arises from an accumulated chain of embodied choices and leaves her transformed at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure hits as a crystallized Conceptual Repricing: the dissolved-compass-heart reconfigures her future and the town’s timeline; the Accumulative/Textural pattern (rain-vials → upward rain) tightens perfectly with no teleport leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brass compass, corked vials, and lagoon-black water serve as micro-settings that physically constrain her next move; the stone door exhaling and fossil confetti track geologically and spatially without restroom break description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate where explanations fail—escalates via the needle’s swing and the vision-knees collapse; the price (compass-body fusion) is unmistakable and forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of “a place beyond explanation” emerges entirely through action and image; the rain falling upward reframes memory and labor without a whisper of direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is sensorily precise, eccentric, and consistent—“petrichor sewn into waistcoat vials” could only belong to Ivy; no head-hop or register leak even under surreal pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences modulate from languid dawn description to staccato cavern descent; zero loops, high compression, and metaphors (fossil confetti) always tie to motion or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrichor-as-memory-currency and a compass that points to post-industrial limbo synthesize industrial-fantasy tropes into something unmistakably new; the risk of lyrical abstraction is rewarded by cost-laden closure.</comment>
