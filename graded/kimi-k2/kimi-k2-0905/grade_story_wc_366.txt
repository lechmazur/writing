<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence, embodied in his wordless stone-glass replies, drives every beat; the bottled sea-glass act crystallizes a lifetime of silent obligation with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias rows away cradling the bottled glow, reconfiguring the stake from “keep the lamp lit” to “keep the memory lit”; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern room’s cracked panes, iron catwalk, and shifting stones anchor every choice; the sea glass itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from “lamp gone dark” to “keeper possibly gone”; Elias’s micro-choice—bottling the glass—forecloses the option of restoring light and carries visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of witness versus repair emerges wordlessly through the stone-and-glass dialogue; the final image reweights absence into guardianship without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose’s salt-creased cadence, precise sensory filter, and controlled psychic distance remain consistent; every metaphor (“salt-ghost,” “green warmth”) is earned by POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image, motion, and emotion; figurative language is sparse, purposeful, and never muddles the closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The anonymous stone-message ritual transforms the familiar “haunted lighthouse” trope into a quiet elegy of custodianship; the innovation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
