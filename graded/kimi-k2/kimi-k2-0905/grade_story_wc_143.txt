<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inspector’s curiosity vs mourning is embodied in micro-choices—stealing the grain, burying half, delaying shutter—each with visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“voice cracked on the last word”), emotions embodied through haptic heartbeat sync. Final renunciation (letting the anemones close) is earned by prior causality and carries felt loss. Minor slip: “purposefully curious” is once label-speak, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shutter clicks at the exact crimson flush, crystallizing the irreversible loss. Causal chain—grain timers → anemone lifespan → shutter timing—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by Earthrise and regolith crunch within 120 words. Persistent constraint: neural backup expiry at sunrise tightens every beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Mount Selene summit, vitrified regolith, feldspar vein, and antique film camera all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Earth’s blue glow and terminator wind are not postcard backdrops but active timers. Micro-setting (basalt shard hiding the slower grain) directly enables the closure beat. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—document extinction before sunrise—tightens via chemical timers and neural backup expiry. One meaningful deepening: the buried grain’s rose flush announces irreversible end, forcing the shutter. Cost is visible on page: “the only color left of them.” Agency is witnessing as resistance; no external coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of bearing witness against cosmic indifference emerges through specific particulars—hourglass grain, anemone heartbeat, fossil imprint—never stated. Final image (ghost flower pressed into stone) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in “curiosity as mourning” is earned through embodied action. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: lunar regolith “glittered like shattered glass,” “crystalline clicks” of folding petals. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences during wait, staccato shutter clicks at climax. No head-hopping; POV stays locked in inspector’s visor. Diction precise, e.g., “terminator wind,” “vitrified.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. High density: “a bead of water onto the larger half of the sand grain, starting the reaction that would darken in exactly forty-three minutes.” Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“paper lantern,” “ghost flower”—never muddled. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lunar anemones that bloom once every seven years to drink starlight is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Hourglass grain as chemical timer and relic of abandoned timekeeping transforms familiar extinction trope. Risk-taking in quiet lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; story would collapse if relocated.</comment>
