<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inspector’s curiosity, theft of the sand grain, and inner conflict (“want to outlast” vs. “contract ends at sunrise”) drive every beat. Her micro-choices (burying half-grain, two-part chemical timer) crystallize final stakes with visible cost Visibility of cost: the last second she photographs is literally the last light of the living anemone; the shutter click forecloses the last possible path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single, coherent causal arc under Situational lens: arrival–wait–darken–shoot. Two unequal sand halves create internal timer; pink bloom triggers shutter exactly at 00:43, a clean before/after that reweights the stake (moon’s irrevocable dawn).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lunar regolith, Earth-light, electrostatic wind pressure choices via the micro-tripod and reaction setup. Moonlit summit serves as physical stage and moral vantage, constraining where she can stand, light, and exist—its ridge limits retreat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Last flowering” vs. 43-minute extinction forms the escalating clock. Sand timer narrows options to one possible second; the shutter release is the only act with agency, and its price (fossil imprint) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Subtext of “left-behind miracles” vs. “Space Age turned away” emerges from specifics—unregistered extinction, abandoned Tycho hourglass, grandmother’s film camera. Final fossil image reweights the idea that documentation is resistance against forgetting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical yet sparse, internal voice marked by selective lunar detail (“vitrified regolith that glittered like shattered glass”). Parallel structure between dying dawn and dying minutes; electrostatic wind whisper fits the dawning hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density; zero overwrought metaphors. Visual precision—“metal heartbeat echoing inside her helmet”—advances pressure; faint tremor conveyed with craft, no loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh mash-up: scientific relic + chemical timer and micro-film closure on a life cycle longer than human lifetimes. Specific lunar constraint (sun 43 min away) turns Earthrise into ticking bomb, an inflection that feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Setup, Development, Payoff all locked to inspector. Decisions narrow: frames scene with tilt-rule camera, buries grain for timer, releases shutter at final instant—each act non-swappable without breaking closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Twin halves drive Setup (early goal), Development (timing mechanism exact to beat), Payoff (final trigger). Chemical bloom visible in ending; removal collapses the 43-minute logic.</question>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>“Dawning hush” rules tactics: electrostatic whispers, pulsing-anemone silence, chemical alarm set to the same dawning hush rhythm. Concept changes options—silence is now the expiration timer.</question>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Purposefully curious trait is embodied: steals hourglass sand, tests reactants, waits forty-three minutes instead of taking a quick frame. Curiosity precipitates every action, visible tradeoff in final cost.</question>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Outlasting is the single narrative engine—she will outlast lunar night itself. Timer and shutter hinges on exactly outlasting the final micro-second of light prior to extinction; redefines all options.</question>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Chemical timer mechanics are taught (pink blush, differing half-size reagents) and directly trigger the shutter; removal wrecks the entire 43-minute countdown logic.</question>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Summit ridge constrains tripod placement, aerial view frames Earthrise, UV angle predicts sterile exposure. Setting pressure enables the only vantage and exact timing of the shot.</question>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lunar clock compresses choices—Earthrise speeds sunrise, 43-minute reagent countdown tightens decisions. Live electrostatic wind announces dawn arrival.</question>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Initially stated in field notes (“photograph the final observation”), motivation is dramatized—she hesitates, breath held, capturing the end means her neural backup will expire too. Conflicted desire sharpens the peak beat.</question>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Earthrise glow frames everything in dawnlit melancholy; final fossil imprint retains the mood, with soft crystalline clicks and “bioluminescent regret.” Tone deepens and charges the final image.
