<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s interiority is richly embodied (“tears mixing with dust to make pale mud”), motives escalate from curiosity to public confession, and the final renunciation of name carries palpable cost. The dynasty-ender identity is dramatized through micro-choices (fitting the crank, tearing the map, lifting the bloodied page) rather than labels. Minor deduction for Muse’s off-stage presence that never applies direct pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each rotation of the crank tightens stakes until the confession ruptures dynastic myth. Closure is a decisive change—Arin’s public reading—paid for by blood and name. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the snapped brass and the open door.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia reading room is tactile and selective: brass gramophone, gilt atlases, dust as “powdered light.” Micro-setting constrains action—handle hidden between atlases, confession trapped in wax. Final image of open door reweights the room from tomb to threshold. No wasted cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dynastic guilt versus public truth—tightens with every crank click. One meaningful reversal: private listening becomes public broadcast. Cost is the cut palm and forfeited lineage. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited guilt emerges from the wax confession and blood-signed map; no moralizing. Final image of statues wreathed in river flowers reconfigures meaning without statement. Subtext in Muse’s silence and the open door invites counter-readings of complicity or liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, sepia-toned syntax mirroring the room’s decay. No head-hopping; Muse remains atmospheric. Compression like “dust…ancestral breath” teaches lyric pattern early and pays off in the bloodied page lantern. Occasional elevated diction (“eloquently silent”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“golden shadows folding like slow wings”) cohere without muddle. Minor purple in “sepia silhouettes of kings who once posed as gods” but forgiven under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gramophone as dynastic lie-detector, crank as generational bridge, wax confession as living indictment. Risky lyric compression pays off in the blood-map treaty. Specificity prevents trope drift; story would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
