<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin’s dynastic guilt and hunger for truth are viscerally embodied; the torn-map bandage makes the cost visible. Interior contradiction pulses in every crank-turn that both resurrects and incriminates his line. The choice to speak the confession publicly is earned by the blood-signed treaty in the carpet. Only the off-stage “Muse” keeps this from a 9—Arin’s the sole decider, so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: the dynasty’s myth is shattered, Arin’s name burned clean, city adorned with river flowers—cost paid in blood and heritage. Accumulative lens holds: each rotation thickens historical density until the stylus drop reweights everything. Causality is tight—missing handle → found → confession → public reckoning; no off-stage rescues. The snapped handle’s jagged star is the persistent constraint that shapes the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sepia reading room is no backdrop; dust-as-breath, brass-rain ghost-frequency, and wax voice physically steer Arin’s movement and choice. The gramophone’s warmth and the carpet’s faded fleurs-de-lis micro-set the moral stage where blood meets ink. Northwest shelf geography is tracked without drift; spatial choreography stays clean. Final window-framed cityscape externalizes the shift, giving the closure image its conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dynasty vs. moral truth—tightens with every crank click that drags ancestral guilt into audibility. Mid-story reversal: warm handle implies Muse, raising the cost of proceeding. Escalation is accumulative: dust spirals into silhouettes, voice becomes collective, confession scales from private sin to public reckoning. Persistent constraint—the snapped brass star in flesh—keeps pressure alive through the final window speech.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the wax itself: history is a recording that can be replayed, re-scarred, and finally re-written by the heir who dares to bleed. No moralizing—river flowers on stone kings deliver the conceptual repricing. Subtext hums in “eloquently silent” hush and brass warmth, guilt made tactile. Final image of nameless Arin walking toward new names reframes identity without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays locked to Arin’s perceptual filter—dust tasted as ancestral breath, stylus voice felt as dynasty’s collective throat. Syntax lengthens and compresses with crank rhythm; sepia, brass, wax, river recur as charged motifs, not decoration. No head-hop; Muse remains air-pressure, preserving distance. Register never drifts into academic abstraction—diction stays sensorial, mythic, yet precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from cathedral length to cruciform fragments, pacing the crank-turn ritual. Metaphors (dust = powdered light, confession = stepping-stone bridge) are few, sharp, and paid off. Zero paraphrase loops; each line adds sensory or causal newness. Final blood-ink merger is rendered in one clean image—no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—scion confronts ancestral crime—is re-animated through gramophone wax and standing-wave physics, making memory acoustic and tactile. Risk: handle snaps, cutting heir, turning artifact into literal shrapnel of history—bold yet inevitable. River-people statues festooned with flowers reconfigures public space without sermon. Could edge higher if Muse’s archival myth were less gestural.</comment>
