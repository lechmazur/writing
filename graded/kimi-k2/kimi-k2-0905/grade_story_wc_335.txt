<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s reverse walking embodies defiance and fragility; micro-choice of spitting into dust crystallizes the refusal to forget. Mentor’s absence and the mentor-name shard create a layered interior contradiction without exposition. Final stance—walking backward with child—earns the endurance as visible, embodied cost: she becomes memory’s archive at personal erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: teacup circle unbroken and shard-name fused into coat mirror rewrite exile into cyclical mentorship under visible cost. Drive (Accumulative/Textural) taught early in layered repetitions and shard-light returns. One transition from mentor absence to new apprentice is legible, causal breaks zero; cost remains legible through “shard over her heart” final beat under inferential lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Forgotten library shadows, captive light shard, and bronze plaque function as micro-setting pressing choices—every annotation tool and reflected three o’clock direct spatial choreography. Exhale of shelves at end recalibrates space to hold future quiet defiance. Specificity never stalls momentum; setting becomes embodied constraint rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—refuse forgetting vs archive loss—is tightened every time she annotates or circles the cup; each reversible clause seals her own future exile deeper. Payoff visible in mentor-name shard burrowing into coat and the teacup now unbroken. No external reversals needed; coherent pressure from the rule-set itself forces stance crystallization and reconfigures options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of memory as resistance emerges from choices: spitting instead of confessing, shard-name swallowing, child instructed by absence. Resonant closure reweights exile from punishment into quiet transmission line; ambiguity remains intact, no moralizing sentence mars ending. Concrete action teaches resilience, not abstract assertion, achieving subtle, haunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice lyrical and controlled; perceptual signature vivid (“dust scuffing… afternoon shadow caught in glass”). No head-hopping; POV modest yet emotionally precise. Compression, shard imagery pattern taught early, paid off at closure without clarity loss. Dialogue minimal but natural (“Triangles… circle almost mended”), indirection serves subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor engine runs hot but purposeful—every shard and shadow returns to constrain choice rather than decorate. Only trace of overwrite in “a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut”—arguably self-ornamental yet brief and earned. Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold issues, high information density per line. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with scene breath; no clarity dulling peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of reversibility literalized through backward walking and memory trade-off is fresh; transformation uses library-as-memory-body motif in non-obvious way. Risk-taking in non-linear structure pays off under coherent lens (accumulative) without gimmickry. Specificity of shard annotations, tea geometry, mentor legacy creates memorable interior vision not easily transplanted elsewhere.</comment>
