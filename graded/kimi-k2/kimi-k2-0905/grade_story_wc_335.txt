<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulse—refusing to forget yet walking deeper into exile—drives every beat; her embodied fear (boots scuffing dust, shard-light scattering) and final wordless offer to the child crystallize a credible renunciation with visible cost. The mentor’s absence is felt as pressure, not exposition. Minor: the child’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s seven backward circuits rewrite the exile’s rule, the teacup left as Charged Poise. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard-caught glint and leaf geometry tightens the stakes until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is taught early by the pinned three-o’clock shadow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library breathes through its objects: the captive afternoon shadow constrains Lira’s reading of futures; the ghost swing creaks in sync with her pulse; the teacup on the sill becomes the final anchor. Spatial choreography is clean; every detail pressures choice or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refuse forgetting yet save the library—tightens when the leaves predict her own binding; the cost is felt in the spit of “combative tenderness” and the backward sealing of exile clauses. One meaningful deepening suffices; agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as quiet, wordless mentorship emerges from concrete acts: walking backwards, annotating absence, leaving the cup. The final annotation—“Resilience is walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you”—reweights all prior motion without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyric, and consistent: “shard-mirror archivist,” “afternoon shadow caught in glass,” “blade smiles when it chooses not to cut.” Syntax mirrors the backward motion; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and information-dense; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“scattering three o’clock across cracked spines”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates under pressure. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as a memory-for-return bargain feels fresh; the shard-mirror coat, leaf-reading, and backward mentorship synthesize into a singular vision. Risky structure—walking backwards as literal and metaphorical device—heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
