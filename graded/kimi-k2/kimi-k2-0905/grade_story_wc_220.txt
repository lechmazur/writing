<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scraps’ shift from corpse-tracker to courier of closeness is embodied in every scent-translated choice; Kite’s trembling fingers and barefoot landing show stakes. Motivation is rooted in the hound’s sensory vocation and the girl’s loss, culminating in the brother’s emergence where “distance kneels.” Minor slip: brother’s interiority is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wax leaf kissed to the cylinder rewrites the riddle into coordinates, collapsing distance at felt cost (softening wax, orchard smoke over gunpowder). Causal chain—leaf → riddle → scent map → rescue—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cracked wasteland, rusted drones, and moonlit wax create a tactile crucible; the leaf-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and copper light, guiding every beat. Spatial choreography is clean from scrapyard to buried subway car.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens when the riddle’s answer must be named to save the brother. One decisive deepening: the leaf’s revelation reweights the map from abstract to olfactory coordinates. Cost is the softening wax and the hound’s limp, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: closeness is the only distance worth traveling, reweighted by orchard smoke replacing gunpowder. Subtext lives in the hound’s limp and the leaf’s crimson veins—war’s residue turned promise. Final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, scent rendered as syntax; “wild hush” modulates from artillery echo to quiet dawn. No head-hopping; Kite’s whisper and Scraps’ low bark carry distinct idiom. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line layers scent, light, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language serves rather than obscures. Rhythm accelerates during dig and softens at reunion, mirroring emotional arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: scent-as-syntax, phonograph-as-map, leaf-as-relic-of-orchard. Tropes of post-war scavenger tales are transformed through sensory specificity. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
