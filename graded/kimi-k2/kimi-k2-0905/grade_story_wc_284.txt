<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The burned spy’s contradictory impulses—prudence versus daring—are embodied in the knee stab when he kneels to uncover the slate; the final renunciation of the pillbox and his scar “pulling tight as if smiling” crystallize a credible shift with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the transmission rewrites his legend and the crushed pillbox forecloses any future identity; the causal chain from pillbox code → slate → transmitter → signal is tight, and the cost is visible in the heel grinding the portrait into snow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bluff’s wind-turbine trickle, frostbitten briars, and iron-tasting air constrain every move; the snowdrop through the slate recharges the setting as final image, making the environment an active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—transmit the keycard data to atone—is signaled early; the tightening occurs when he must sacrifice the pillbox (his last tether to Sera) to power the transmitter, a visible price that narrows options and crystallizes the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Fixing what is broken” emerges through the spy’s act of self-immolation by confession; the snowdrop and the crushed silver dust reweight the theme without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer that courage is the act itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is spare, weathered, and tactile—“silver hush,” “face half molten”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the upload and breathes in the final walk; no head-hopping, and every perception is filtered through scarred nerves and wind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty (action + atmosphere) and the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the zephyr’s curl; no mixed metaphors or register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The spy-gardeners metaphor and “codes in accumulated snow” feel fresh; the synthesis of espionage tradecraft with seasonal renewal is specific to this voice and would collapse if names or places were swapped.</comment>
