<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist’s interior shifts—rooting underground, swallowing the seed—are embodied and directly drive closure; contradictory impulses (tend the wound vs. release the miracle) act in-scene, fused with plant-telepathy cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain holds end-to-end: hourglass signalled → tunnel images → seed payoff reconfigures time; closure unit (seed as Earned Stasis/earned release) lands on page with visible reframing of scar-as-story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Quiet tower courtyard, hourglass, and seed-talismans work as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image; frost and red-sand shift anchor emotional temperature while supporting the coup-de-théâtre closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pressure spirals through reopened wound → blood offering → miracle release; stakes tighten to singular choice: fresh loss for closure. The escalation is shaped entirely by protagonist agency under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Scars are stories written sideways” theme grows organically through concrete acts—tunnel of coffee rings, blood syllables—culminating in the seed’s reweighted period. Final image re-questions the miracle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical density under pressure; patterned telepathy cipher (“chlorophyll code”) is taught early and resolved. Rhythm accelerates into burial sequences without head-hopping; final repetition lines reweight meaning through sound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops; verbs root, coil, braid. Frosted neck / lodged bone metaphor is unmixed and drives momentum; “meteor hush” refrain modulates pace and tone without opacity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Surgery-to-plant-telepathy premise is audacious but earned through concrete serum callback; the miracle-buried-in-soil twist feels inevitable after earlier whispers. One green seed as Tiny crystallized image underscoring closure is a fresh inflection.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Choices (re-open scar, unclasp gauze, step into stone) create every major turn; the seed resolves her arc under live cost. Loss-for-release trade traced start to finish.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Hourglass appears early (setup), flips later (action icon), but lacks mid-scene pressure; final red-sand pivot is payoff but obliquely reweighted, not causally pressed.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Displaced miracle buries in soil, forces protagonist’s blood offering for release; concept threads root action and dictates closure’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Telepathy enacted when plants drink blood and replay sister’s laugh—visible constraint shaping move; fading afterward signals time-bound cost.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Tunnel action—pressing flesh to stone, falling roots—redefines physical stakes and forecloses surface exit; unalterable without re-writing climactic descent.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Coffee-ring tunnel offers visual guidance to underground miracle; mechanic shown but lacks earlier signalling that actively shapes tactics—late appearance trends low.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Tower courtyard and observatory rooms ground atmosphere; loaming stone under hands is micro-pressure, but location itself stays largely atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade>
<comment>Post-anesthesia awareness provides tone key (disorientation), yet actual minutes elapsed are vague—clock does not tighten choices or tactics.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Read scars” desire is dramatized: each drop of blood becomes a syllable; conflict between saving sister memory and releasing miracle scales motives visibly.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>“Meteor hush” hum modulates from dawn quiet to burial depth, charges final seed image; tone coherence threads start to finish, though partial vegetal anthropomorphism slightly strains intensity.</comment>
