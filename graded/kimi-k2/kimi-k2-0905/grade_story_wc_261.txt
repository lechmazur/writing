<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the scar-splitting choice is foreshadowed and paid for with blood. Motive—trade fresh loss for the miracle—drives every beat. Micro-choice of swallowing the seed crystallizes earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seed replaces the hourglass, reweighting time and memory. Causal chain (blood → miracle release → seed) is tight; no orientation drift. Cost is legible in the reopened wrist and swallowed laugh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tower, dawn, and loam tunnel are tactile and constrain movement. Frosted hourglass and coffee rings evolve from props to portals. Micro-setting (granite softening into loam) directly enables the descent beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem sister’s death via miracle—tightens when “trade requires fresh loss.” Agency: protagonist reopens wound, pays blood, swallows seed. Escalation is causal and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of reading scars and teaching silence emerges through action, never lecture. Final image (seed replacing hourglass) reweights memory without moralizing. Subtext in plants’ last whisper carries cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through morphine haze and plant telepathy. Syntax modulates with descent—long sentences root, short ones surface. No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each image advances stakes. Metaphors (lodged bone, vertebra of memory) are coherent. No loops or scaffold; clarity never sacrificed for lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Plant-telepathy grief ritual feels fresh yet inevitable. Displaced miracle, hourglass, and coffee-ring portal synthesize into singular mythic logic. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
