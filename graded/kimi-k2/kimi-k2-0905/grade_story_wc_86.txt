<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—regret for his brother versus duty to protocol—are embodied in the brass pull and the moon calendar; the final renunciation of the pull carries visible cost as he “descended…pocket lighter…heart fuller.” Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Micro-choices (offering gloves, timing the pause, humming the lullaby) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The only minor slip is the near-therapeutic phrasing “recycle mistakes into wisdom,” but it is offset by immediate dramatized action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope-casting ritual crystallizes a new neutral space and Kael’s stance of non-possession. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each moon-phase reflection and object-handling beat deepens the dominant stake until the final image reweights it. Cost is legible in the line “palms empty yet heavier.” Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet’s stones, mist, and salt wind constrain every gesture (gloves against cold, rope over void). The brass pull functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when Seris keeps it. Sensory selection is urgent—wind biting skin, moonlight slick on blades—filtered through Kael’s professional priorities. Environment subtly mirrors internal thaw: “the parapet felt wider” as possibilities expand.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent either crown from claiming victory—tightens through the moon-phase calendar and the ritual of naming fears. One meaningful deepening occurs when guards lower spears after confessing fears, narrowing options toward non-violent release. Cost is felt in Kael’s relinquishment of the pull and the soaked, unsigned parchment. Agency remains with Kael throughout; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of knots, moon rhythms, and the lullaby: forgiveness is a space widened by absence. Subtext operates in the silent lowering of spears and the un-mourned parchment. The final image of “two coastlines no longer aiming cannons” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No thematic echo or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly inside Kael’s perceptual signature—“salt and regret,” “moon remembers tide.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during the rope ritual. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich (“Can contrition be weighed…?”). No head-hopping; POV distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ink blooming like squid grief” does double descriptive and emotional work. Rhythm varies naturally; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—each image (leviathan tail, moon blade) serves the closure. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he asked each guard to name…”) is offset by immediate dramatized payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>The synthesis of moon-phase negotiation, object-memory transference, and fear-naming ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The drawer-pull-as-key and rope-casting are non-obvious yet grounded. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the emotional calculus collapses. Risk-taking (lyric ritual over political thriller beats) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
