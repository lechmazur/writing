<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conjurer’s interiority is vivid and embodied—reciting primes, feeling weight resolve into warmth—yet the master remains a cipher; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost, but the master’s absence never pressures a live choice, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the astrolabe’s beam re-opens the orchard, reweighting ambiguous loss into a limit that can be approached. Causal chain from glass-eye alignment → mosaic opening → astrolabe pointer is clean, with persistent cost—the master still gone, seedlings fragile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is no backdrop; its calcite trunks and stalactite drips constrain every move—climbing the fossil tree, wedging eyes, catching drops. Final seedlings sprout from starlight pool, environment charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—solve the equation of grief—tightens once: the mosaic opens only after precise alignment, narrowing options from endless search to measurable tending of seedlings. Cost is the unchanged absence of the master.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: grief as unsolved equation, emotion as locus of intersections. Final integral-sign-heart dripping into seedlings offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—measured, arcane, mathematically lyrical (“arithmetic of delight,” “interval between drop and stone”). Perceptual signature stays consistent; no head-hopping; compression and elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern. Minor scaffold in “each drip a note” / “each drop a note” echo, but no loops obscure closure. High information density, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of taxidermy, astrolabe, and emotional calculus feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric structure holds; no derivative echoes. Specificity of “integral sign cradling a heart” crystallizes originality.</comment>
