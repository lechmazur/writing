<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conjurer’s quiet, obsessive rituals—priming primes, rotating the glass eyes—form the causal spine of every key beat; his interior collisions of grief and curiosity drive tactical choices and the ending’s renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis: the astrolabe gift and seedlings crystallize “missing heartbeat” into measurable motion while leaving the master’s fate ambiguous; the lyric structure obeys a fully coherent lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Calcite trunks, drip-fed silence, and fossilised fruit act as micro-setting: the glass eye beam uses stalactite geometry to project the symbol; environment limits access and modulates urgency.</comment>

<comment>Welcoming opacity controlled by pressure—e.g., “radioactive calm that chimed no longer” opens without scaffolding—keeps momentum and is free of loops or violet bloom.</comment>

<comment>Linking grief to astrolabe/seedling synthesis re-weights Sci-fi magic into precision instrument of mourning; uncompromised specificity feels inevitable yet startling.</comment>
