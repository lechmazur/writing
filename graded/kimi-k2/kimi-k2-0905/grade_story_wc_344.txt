<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s grief-tinted obsession with “the rhythm of repair” is concrete and embodied; every gear he fingers carries the pulse of his mentor’s absence. The moment he aligns his own chipped key with the mirror-perfect reflection, we see contradictory impulses—self-blame and self-correction—acted out in one motion. The final beat fuses interior need with external vocation: he stays inside the remembered workshop, trading escape for custodianship, a cost that feels scaled to the story’s lyric register. Only the mentor remains a silhouette; a single remembered flaw would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the door vanishes, the clocks tick inward, and Rowan’s pulse is literally retimed—an undeniable conceptual cost. The causal chain (prophecy → gear test → mirror correction → door opens → stays inside) is airtight, each beat because/therefore. Orientation lands by line 4; no debt applied. The lens stays Causal throughout; even the mirror’s “better versions” are treated as a repairable material, not a surreal loophole. One hairline slip: the phrase “collaborating in silent forgery” momentarily abstracts the physical transaction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library is not backdrop; its frost races along the key, sealing the crack that lets the lock breathe—environment directly enables the climax. Micro-setting (mentor’s restored workshop) reconfigures the emotional stakes in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is locksmith-specific: metallic hums, mirrored gleams, oil-and-thunderstorm air. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track lantern, gear, mirror, door without drift. The setting literally locks the protagonist inside at the end—constraint that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when no gear hums, forcing the mirror workaround. The reversal (flawed key becomes whole) narrows options: he can’t blame the tool anymore; he must stay and become the custodian. Cost is the vanished exit, paid on-page. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; a second intermediate complication could have lifted this to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative imagery of gears, eclipses, and mirrors: repair is not erasure but integration of the flaw. The final tick “inward” rather than forward reweights time itself as the thing being mended. No moral is stated; the clocks teach their cadence, the protagonist adjusts his pulse, and the reader feels the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: will he ever leave, or is custodianship eternal? That uncertainty feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is compressed, lyrical, yet locksmith-precise: “coat crackling with rime,” “eclipse-shaped pawls.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Rowan notices edges, reflections, metallic temperatures. Rhythm modulates: long frost-laden sentences stretch, then snap into short beats like ticking gears. No head-hop; interior access stays tight. The elevated diction always serves the ice-prism atmosphere rather than showing off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is varied; no template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent—mirrors as “frozen wave,” bronze that “swell as though breathing”—and never mixed. Information density is high: one sentence often does setting, emotion, and foreshadowing. Minor scaffold: “hauntingly bright” is repeated three times; while purposeful, it slightly dulls the final occurrence. No loops or paraphrase stacks in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith who repairs time via mirrored alternate drafts feels fresh, yet grows logically from clockpunk grief lore. Risk is taken—quiet surrealism inside a hard-causal frame—and pays off. The mentor’s off-stage death could have felt generic, but the chipped key literalizes the wound, preventing archetype drift. One near-echo: “library above the clouds” recalls Borges, yet the frost-forge mechanic transforms the reference.</comment>
