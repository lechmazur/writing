<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s interior contradiction—yearning to mend cosmic rhythms while nursing a stalled heart—drives every micro-choice; the healed eclipse-key crystallizes his earned shift from apprentice to custodian with visible cost (door vanishes, mentor’s realm claims him). Mentor loss is backstory but is dramatized through the key’s fracture and repair, so BRR is met. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Rowan’s entry into the mirrored workshop re-weights his identity and forecloses return. Causal lens holds—each beat (prophecy scraps → gear trials → mirror collaboration → door opening) links by therefore logic. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is legible: “doorway back had vanished.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen library, mirrored hall, and mentor’s workshop are rendered through selective sensory detail that constrains action—mirrors literally rewrite the key, altitude freezes breath into gauze. Micro-setting (key, door, mirrors) functions as setting and tool. No spatial drift; environment guides choice. Gate met: setting charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mend the cosmic/metaphorical lock and his own heart—tightens when no gear fits until the mirror collaboration offers a single path. Agency drives escalation: Rowan chooses to align reflection with reality, sealing the key’s crack and accepting exile. Cost is felt on page (door locks behind him).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repair as self-forgiveness emerges from concrete events (key, mirror, clocks ticking inward) without statement. Final image—Rowan adjusting escapements to his own pulse—offers non-literal answer to how one mends a wobbling world. Subtext in mirrored “better versions” reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lunar-eclipse locksmith’s perceptual signature filters every detail through mechanical metaphors (“gears still warm from another craftsman’s dreams”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences in calm moments, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; POV stable. Dialogue absent, so N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“hauntingly bright” returns in mirrors, then fades). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum. Minor elevated diction remains within Rowan’s artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes clockwork cosmology, mirrored alternate drafts, and grief ritual into an inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression taught early and sustained. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped. Fresh inflection: mirrors as collaborative repair tool rather than passive reflection.</comment>
