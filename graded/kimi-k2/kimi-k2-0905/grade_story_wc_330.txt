<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carpenter’s erased-name anonymity and “memory of gears” root his interiority; the wooden horses’ nostril-flare response externalizes his long grief. His decision to kneel and sing memory rather than speak is earned by the prior image of swallowed words. The final footfall-notes crystallize a credible renunciation: he leaves carpentry for itinerant song, cost paid in the glow left behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each lyrical shard layers silence until the halo reconfigures it into music. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the fragment dissolves into his chest, reframing silence as “full, round, and singing.” Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but taught early; the corridor of backward-aging mirrors cues the reader. Cost is visible: the train’s faint halo and the carpenter’s departure mark an irreversible shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is compressed to the overturned car’s starlit pool and the ribs of the train, each detail constraining movement and reflection. The concave floor becomes a literal sheet of music, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: boots on sawdust, fingertips brushing water, footfalls leaving notes. Sensory economy favors hush, metallic chimes, and wood-scent, all filtered through the carpenter’s practiced attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: wrest meaning from silence. Escalation is textural—each metallic note tightens the hush until the halo forces a choice. The micro-turn occurs when the fragment projects the trapeze artist’s unfinished arc; the carpenter’s agency is to complete it in memory. Cost is the dissolution of the fragment and the abandonment of the train’s last glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between silence as absence and as unopened mouth. The halo does not grant voice but reveals the music already nested in silence—a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext operates in the wooden horses’ impossible neigh and the trapeze artist’s shadow landing softly. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: silence becomes a “new silence—full, round, and singing.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature is the carpenter’s tactile memory of grain and brass. Syntax modulates from long breaths (“misting hush”) to staccato notes (“a track of music only the brave could follow”). No dialogue; interior monologue stays within lexicon of craft. Experimental elision (“a lullaby of almost”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors are precise: “carriages curved like the ribs of some forgotten beast.” No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) is voice-motivated. Rhythm accelerates into the final chord, then releases. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned circus as silent instrument, halo as comma punctuating sky. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when silence itself becomes the song. No close echoes; the wooden horses’ memory and the trapeze artist’s suspended arc feel inevitable in hindsight. Conceptual integrity holds—no late rule changes.</comment>
