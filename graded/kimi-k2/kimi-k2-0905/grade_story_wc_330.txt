<question>1</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The carpenter registers as a solitary figure whose muted persistence arcs believably from motive to silent fulfillment. Yet his internality, while lyric, stays abstract—“lifetime of swallowed words” could be etched into a single vivid snapshot to deepen contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>A Causal lens holds neatly: the mistaken step through warped mirrors → hidden oasis → fragment touch → intangible duet → final echo. Closure delivers earned stasis—cost paid in the dissolution of the fragment and the irreversible pivot toward listener rather than maker.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Abandoned-train micro-setting supplies tactile decay; the overturned car-as-oasis functions as immediate constraint for footing and light and re-weights the halo’s shine. A slight surplus of poetic list-building risks diluting selectivity but never stalls orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to interpret silence as possibility”—rises steadily; the discovery of the fragment constricts the space for skepticism, forcing active embodiment of the mute song. Escalation remains coherent but leans lyrical rather than sharply tested by material loss.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme refrains from moralizing; instead resonance accumulates through images of carousel horses breathing through wood grain and the final “glow of rails turned into staff.” The ending reframes silence as generative rather than empty without a didactic sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is sustained: the carpenter’s interiority sounds like sawdust in the lungs, voice pitched toward hush and echo. No POV leakage or jarring register drift; lyric compression remains taught and repayable at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry internal music, density high, rare loops. Minor tautologies—e.g., “misting hush” repeated in close proximity—could have been tuned for variety, but they never obscure causal clarity or clutter the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The halo-as-comma and circus train resurrected as resonant instrument avoid familiar trope mapping; the final inversion (singer becomes audience, train becomes score) feels both earned and fresh in hindsight, though premise sits near magical-realist thresholds.</comment>
