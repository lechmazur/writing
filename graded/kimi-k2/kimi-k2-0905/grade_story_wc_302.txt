<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied, but the veiled dreamer’s contradictory impulses are stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation (“I am happy” unsaid) is earned yet feels slightly abstract because the memory-price is shown only in summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the library collapses into the space between letters, the veil reseals, the lie returns—cost is felt. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the reversed watch and cipher pattern taught early pays off in the final dot of light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing, breathing library is rendered with selective, sensory density; the mercury mirror and petrified-breath desk constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting actively shapes grammar and movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering unspoken words—tightens when each blood-letter costs memory; pressure escalates as the watch stutters and the library begins to collapse. Agency is visible in the decision to unsay the lie and seize the syllable-key.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as debt, silence as currency. The final image of the restored lie and resealed veil reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the library truly cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“chandeliers of phosphorescent algae dripped light like slow rain”). Compression and reversal motifs are taught early and held to the end; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“corridors of their own,” “grammar enforced by propagation delays”) risk overwriting. Rhythm supports pressure; no loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Borgesian library, time-reversed watch, and debt-based linguistics into a fresh synthesis. Risky structure—library spoken, not built—pays off in the mercury-mirror closure; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
