<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deeply embodied archivist: lavender-stained soles, salt-bee wrist, key pressed over a paper heart. Contradiction—whimsy cohabiting with grief—stays active in scene; final choice to leave footprints rather than stay and claim the healing pushes closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases as arcs dovetail into the dove image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—“masterpiece complete when shared”—legible pivot from solitary ritual to collective exhale. Causality intact; cost is the unspoken refusal to linger and the permanent offering of the photographs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lavender, conveyor belt, corkboard, silver key—each object constrains action and charges the final image. Spatial texture precise: knees in blossoms, dove wings spanning factory to field. Only minor drift: factory ruins sketched rather than fully weaponized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is grief transmuted into shared beauty. One decisive tightening: the spiral-dove completion that pulls the townsfolk into witness. Cost legible in leaving the photos behind; escalation is pattern-accumulation; coincidences are atmospheric, not resolutive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Collective healing refrains from moral: “tell me where it hurt” becomes communal exhale rather than slogan. Theme emerges from lavender, rust, and silver halide—no single line dictates meaning. Resonant ambiguity leaves both ache and gratitude intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, percussively lyrical—“metronome counting grief,” “autumn lips,” “salt instead of nectar”—without purple overflow. Syntax modulates with emotional tide; no head-hop. Distinct narrator-signature sustains under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Rich yet controlled metaphors serve action, not ornament; zero loops or scaffold. One instance of stacked figurative density at climax could read as borderline—but momentum remains. No artifact touches the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma-archive collage, post-industrial ruin garden, and participatory art installation. Transmutation of pain into shared image through spiral alignment is non-obvious and earned; memory and setting feel irreplaceable.</comment>
