<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is embodied and specific—“fingers tasting every crack,” “purple with blossoms”—but her decisive micro-choice (pressing the key into the photo) arrives with only faint prior causality; the cost feels aesthetic rather than personal. Still, the contradiction between whimsy and grief is dramatized in action, not summary, and the final shared exhale shows earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dove image reconfigures collective memory, and the town’s joint exhale is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible social cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of photo placement tightens until the dove emerges—and the rule holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lavender, rust, and photographs constrain every beat: blossoms stain soles, conveyor belt coils under thyme, corkboard becomes quilt. Final dove wingspan is literally pinned across factory and field, charging the closure image with place-specific weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can communal pain be transmuted into shared beauty—escalates as each photograph narrows options toward the final spiral. Cost is felt in the grandchildren’s astonished laughter and the town’s collective exhale, a social price paid in exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of arranging scars; no moral is stated. The dove image reweights earlier grief without platitude, offering resonant ambiguity: beauty sharp enough to cut gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded—“metronome counting grief,” “molten light into molds”—with consistent perceptual signature. Compression and elision (“photos kept breathing”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor risk of overwriting in “marriage of rust and bloom,” but momentum never stalls and closure image remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—photo-archivist alchemist of communal grief—is non-obvious and fully committed. Specific details (key frozen in sap, conveyor belt as snake) transform familiar post-industrial elegy into singular vision.</comment>
