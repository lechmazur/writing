<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirelle’s pacifist ethic is embodied in her refusal to force the lock; her interiority (“empathy is sympathetic resonance”) is concrete and character-specific. The embodied cost—she becomes the diary’s echo—earns the final choice. Minor slip: the velvet-patch detail is decorative rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clasp opens by resonance alone, reconfiguring the safe from prison to archive. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each silence catalogued intensifies the final frequency. Cost is legible on the page: “her body now a walking archive.” No orientation or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The workshop’s rusted safe and crystal radio constrain every move; the radio’s diode glows in the final image, charging closure. Sensory detail is selective—guitar-string coil, stickers from bombed plants—filtered through Mirelle’s pacifist gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: cataloguing silences to free the diary. Pressure tightens as she spirals upward through kilohertz; the final silence (forgiveness unheard) forces her to become its echo. The cost—she carries the archive in her bloodstream—narrows future options. Agency is hers; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of listening a lock open: empathy as resonance, not sentiment. The pressed poppy and mirror shard reweight the premise—silence is safe only when shared. No moralizing; the final whisper is earned image, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “petals of nothing would not bruise.” Compression and patterned elision (“the hush inside the hush”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mirelle hears textures others ignore. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Minor loop risk in “silence” repetitions, but each reprise reweights meaning. Final line lands clean with zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The crystal-radio-as-stethoscope for silence is a fresh synthesis; the diary that opens only to resonance is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity (guitar strings from bombed weddings) anchors universals.</comment>
