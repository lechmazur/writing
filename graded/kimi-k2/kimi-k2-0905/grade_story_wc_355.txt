<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mirelle’s pacifist identity and velvet-patched coat anchor her sensory bent, and the brass half-moon diary clasp acts as visceral memory-tuning fork. Emotional embodiment and embodied contradictions (begging silence to scream, walking untouched through firework glare) are strong; yet interiority tilts into lyrical abstraction that softens the felt cost at closure, capping her arc just shy of the 8+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A single clean lens—Accumulative/Textural—holds: silence is harvested, catalogued, then surrendered. Escalation is a slow accumulation of heard absences that reweights the clasp from lock to question, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure image—“tiny pacifist soldier returning home”—carries conceptual cost: renunciation of noise and openness to others’ futures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting is tactile: cedar/truce, iron/surrender, sawdust under skylight-glass children; the radio’s vacuum tubes constrain her tuning choices. Spatial choreography stays clean; however, the environment does not add a fresh mechanical constraint to the climax (the clasp opens from internal realization, not a physical obstacle), so caps just under 8.5 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is “catalogue, then free the silence”; meaningful tightening arrives as Mirelle finds the frequency of forgiveness, a silence that lets the world speak. Choice to leave clasp unlocked is protagonist-driven and forecloses the personal vault; cost is felt in public exposure. Minor friction: absence of external antagonist keeps score below 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Emergent theme of empathy as acoustic practice threads through every silence label and carrier wave. Final frequency reweighted the rule-set without moralizing: “a lighthouse for anyone learning the path.” Achieves a complex, non-binary insight—empathy as an antenna, not an answer—earning the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Third-person lyric sustains velvet-encased voice, velvet-patches as velvet patches: texture consistent. Syntax modulates under fireworks: longer breath-pacing sentences for resonance, then clipped fragments when fuses hiss. Perceptual bias—materials translate to memories: cedar/truce, brass/expanding warmth—stays specific. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Figurative drift toward the end is deliberate, not accidental, thus no major deduction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Information-dense lines (“constellations pressed against the skylight like curious children”) advance tone without stall. Minor loop: “silence... silence” repetition used pattern-taught. Mixed metaphors rare (bullets / singing cannons) accepted under voice. Register drifts into elevated lyricism—acceptable for accumulation design—thus capped below 8.8.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Takes a stock object (diary clasp) and transfigures it into acoustic tuning fork; turns pacifism from slogan into ear-driven practice. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight: every silence catalogued reweights wars and sister-ghost. Combines pacifist, war orphan, starlit attic, radio tuning for empathy in a voice-specific synthesis—bold, coherent, earned.</question>
