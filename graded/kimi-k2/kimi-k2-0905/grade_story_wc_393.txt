<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emil’s guilt-driven mission is vivid, embodied in the ticking heart he turns “between gloved fingers.” The contradiction between faith and bureaucratic complicity is alive in scene, not summary. Micro-choice—paying with the candle fund—makes the cost visible. Yet Rowan remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand, capping the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the board refuses mercy, therefore Emil seeks Olya; because she warns “the song…may not forgive,” he pivots to investigative action. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—sealing the parcel re-weights “second opinion” from mechanical repair to public exposure, cost paid with the candle fund. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5. One of the few pieces where the final tick reconfigures both stakes and moral arithmetic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shop’s “vibrant hush” is not backdrop; gear tension and rain drumming meter Emil’s pulse. The skylight, mandolines, and dust motes are filtered through chaplainic attention to transience. Micro-setting succeeds: the walnut-sized heart literally steers choice. Only the street outside dawn remains generic, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver Rowan a final lullaby—tightens when Olya warns the repaired song may indict Emil. The investigative pivot escalates via agency: he forfeits clerical safety for whistle-blowing. Cost is tangible: candle fund spent, dawn walk toward gurney unchanged. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mechanical vs. moral repair emerges through gear imagery and the unpaid debt of “second opinions.” Final music spilling onto the street reweights earlier lullaby as public plea, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in Olya’s silence after reading the list carries the unspoken cost of complicity. Resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Emil’s clerical sensorium: light “bleaching” instruments, heart “between gloved fingers.” Syntax lengthens under moral strain, then compresses at decision—“Send it to Rowan tonight.” Olya’s dialogue carries subtext without converging to Emil’s diction. No head-hop; perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm breathes with pressure: long sentences for contemplation, clipped imperatives at pivot. Figurative control—dust motes as “slow constellations”—never clutters causality. Zero paraphrase loops; each sentence advances stake or atmosphere. Occasional adjective pairs (“walnut-sized”) are purposeful, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing death-row clemency with antique horology feels inevitable here, not gimmicky. The sailor’s-chronometer spring repurposed for a ballerina’s heart is specific, not steampunk wallpaper. Risk—spending sacred funds on worldly exposure—pays off in closure. Fresh inflection: mercy measured in microns of recut brass.</comment>
