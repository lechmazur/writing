<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning for candor while fearing she has become an echo—drives every beat; the moment she admits “I’m afraid I’ve forgotten how to listen” crystallizes motive under pressure. The final choice to read the unsent letters costs her the illusion that truth had vanished with the water, yet the prose never externalizes this as tidy growth. Micro-choices (inserting the plate, answering the greenhouse) align with her wilt-near-dishonesty trait, but the emotional cost is more asserted than embodied in body or breath. Still, the arc lands as credible renunciation: she trades passive nostalgia for active guardianship of withheld speech.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mailbox opens, the humid breath of withheld truth hits her skin, and the rule-set of the drought-city shifts—candor can now be chosen, not merely mourned. Causal chain holds: map fragment → postal plate → lily-slot → letters → practice of speaking unsent words; each step is gated by Lira’s on-page candor test. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“greenhouse city”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. One minor elasticity: the greenhouse’s creaking questions ride the edge of anthropomorphic convenience, but the device is taught early and paid off when the path brightens, so lens integrity survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The brass mailbox welded to a seed-vault column, exhaling her mother’s scent, functions as micro-setting that directly enables the final reconfiguration; remove it and the closure collapses. Sensory triage is urgent: rust-taste, wilt-orchid air, copper sky—each filtered through Lira’s calligrapher eye for ink and gold. Spatial choreography is clean: floorboard → studio → corridor → vault → mailbox; no floating bodies. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist, forcing the candor trials. The greenhouse’s glass and evaporator constrain movement and supply the only remaining moisture, literalizing the theme of preserved speech.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—recover lost candor—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the map warns “Speak true or the path closes.” Each junction question raises the cost of dishonesty, culminating in the mailbox’s humid breath that makes withheld words physically present. Escalation is accumulative: no single reversal, but density of consequence increases as the city itself tests her. The final price is conceptual yet legible: she gains access to a practice that will expose her to truths she can no longer claim were erased by drought.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between speech and survival in a world that rewards rehearsed loops; the lily-postal plate recharges as sigil of withheld intimacy. Subtext resides in the unmailed letters—maternal love articulated only after death, forcing Lira to confront her own complicity in silence. No moral is stated; the ending image of words absorbing her tears reweights candor as nourishment rather than risk. The concept avoids sentimentality by keeping the mother off-stage and the daughter’s victory contingent on lifelong vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is calligrapher-precise: ink, pollen, gold leaf, rice paste—lexicon stays inside Lira’s perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens during map-repair meditation, then compresses during corridor approach, mirroring emotional pressure. No dialogue, so no register drift; interior monologue avoids filter verbs (“she realized” becomes “she understood then”). The greenhouse’s creaking questions ride the edge of external voice intrusion, but the device is established as diegetic test, not narrator shortcut. Rhythm modulates without drumbeat patterns; final sentence fragment “listen to the” suspends closure, a deliberate ellipsis that enacts the ongoing practice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “tomatoes hung like forgotten lanterns” does double sensory and metaphorical work. No scaffold loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor cluster—“sky the color of old copper… breath tasted of rust”—is justified by the world’s metal-poison atmosphere. Headlamp beam, zinc plate, rice paste: technical terms accurate and motivated. Final-line ellipsis could read as typo, but pattern of withheld speech teaches the truncation; clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of calligraphy, drought, and lost mail feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope checklist echo. The brass mailbox as archive of unsent candor reconfigures familiar “post-apocalyptic quest” into intimate practice rather than external prize. Risk taken: anthropomorphic greenhouse interrogates protagonist, yet the choice is grounded in world logic where truth literally keeps paths open. Transformation test fails if names are swapped—only a calligrapher would read ink-fattened downstrokes as maternal fingerprint, proving specificity.</comment>
