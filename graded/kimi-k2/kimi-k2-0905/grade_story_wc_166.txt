<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between exile and bodily memory is dramatized in every pirouette. Micro-choices—dancing the gaps, letting moonstone dust braid her ribs—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation (walking away at dawn) is earned by prior causality and forecloses the court forever. One notch below 9.0 only because the “obsidian grace” refrain edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stanza bruised into her collarbones reweights the premise—she becomes the banned memory itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each spiral tightens the pattern until only tide remains. Cost is legible in the moonstone’s final extinction and the footprints spiraling into absence. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The twilight garden is not backdrop but instrument: marble rim, dew, and datura scent constrain where her soles can print absence. Spatial choreography is exact; distances from fountain to gate track cleanly. Sensory selection narrows to immediacies—obsidian air, night-blooming datura—mirroring internal stakes. The garden itself is the final reader of her verse, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retain bodily memory under ban—is signaled in line 2 and escalates through each subtractive dance. One decisive intensification: the moonstone’s last grain burns to complete the stanza, foreclosing any return to court. Cost is felt on the page (loss of the dust, permanent exile at dawn). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and grows under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the body’s refusal to forget; no direct statement, only the stanza etched in skin. Subtext pulses in every gap she dances: silence between crickets, withheld breath. Final image—footprints spiraling into absence—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory survives by becoming illegible to censors. No tidy moral, only charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax mirrors tidal rhythm—long swells, sudden cuts. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: “obsidian grace, smooth and cutting.” No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Compression and elision are taught early (“dance the gaps”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent—moonstone minnows, silver lines that absorb starlight—and never clog momentum. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with her final turns. One minor purple phrase (“cosmos clothing her”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—dancing banned memory into one’s own skin—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of exile and censorship are transformed through kinetic specificity. Risky lyric structure pays off: the poem literally becomes her body. No echo of familiar scenes; the final constellation-bruise is singular.</comment>
