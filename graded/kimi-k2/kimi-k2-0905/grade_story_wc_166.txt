<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysira’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her exile is both chosen and endured, and the moonstone dust becomes a tactile extension of her will. The final fledge into verse is earned by prior renunciation and the visible cost of burning the last grain. Minor drift: “obsidian grace” recurs as label rather than lived sensation, blunting peak embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stanza etched on skin reconfigures exile from absence to self-contained cosmos, cost legible in the moonstone’s extinction. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each spiral tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; garden anchors are immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden, body, and moonstone function as micro-setting that constrains every pirouette; dew, moss, and dust dictate where verse can be inscribed. Final image of footprints spiraling into absence recharges the dry fountain’s rim. One stray: “obsidian grace” as taste is vivid, but later as facial cut edges toward convenient symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forbidden memory through dance—tightens when sunrise threatens to seal the ink. Each subtractive turn narrows options until only tide/verse remains. Cost is visible: moonstone consumed, exile irreversible. Agency drives every escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: banned nostalgia vs embodied rhythm, exile as generative void. Final image of skin-sung verses offers non-literal answer—memory survives by becoming untranslatable. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the tide’s mute reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with tidal cadence and dancer’s kinesthetic diction. Compression taught early (“hips forecasting surf”) and paid off in final stanza. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“obsidian grace” twice) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing memory-ban dystopia with mythic dance-ritual feels inevitable and fresh. Moonstone dust as ink, exile as fledge—specific synthesis that would collapse if renamed. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
