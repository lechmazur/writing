<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. the safety of forgetting—are embodied in her trembling hand and the decisive scalpel cut. The final refusal to forget is earned by the prior realization that memories were surrendered, not stolen, and carries visible cost as the greenhouse shudders and the ring withers. Interiority is concrete, specific, and avoids diagnostic self-talk. The only minor slip is a brief “chronically curious” label that could be dramatized further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Mara slices the mushroom, reclaims her memories, and exits without looking back. The inferred lens is Causal—each beat (detection, realization, refusal) narrows options until the final act forecloses forgetting forever. Cost is legible in the greenhouse’s shudder and the withering ring. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and no causality breaks occur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is vivid, selective, and purposeful: peach roots as chandeliers, salt-crystal leaves, ship-rib bones. These details constrain choice—Mara must crawl among dangling roots and shipwrecks to reach the ring—and charge the final image when constellations re-form on the water. Micro-setting (the sextant shards) functions as a mirror of her ages. Only a hairline slip: “crisp nostalgia” is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens once: the realization that she surrendered them forces a final choice. Escalation is driven by her agency under the Causal lens; the mushroom’s pulse urges forgetting, but her scalpel cuts that path off. Cost is visible in the greenhouse’s shudder and the withering ring. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as both burden and identity, curiosity as memory’s homing instinct. The fairy ring and sextant reprise earlier motifs with reweighted meaning. Subtext operates in gesture—the open palm in the margin replaces the crossed-out mushroom. Final image (singing to corrected stars) offers resonant, non-moralizing closure. No thematic drift or overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a folklorist’s cataloguing eye: “constellation of bruises,” “cider and rust.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices fungal spores and star-patterns, not generic “beauty.” No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression (“decades later”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Only minor: “chronically curious” is slightly label-like.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, every line advancing story or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and coherent: “roots dangling like chandeliers of wet rope.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the scalpel cut, longer cadences in memory’s return. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—memories traded to a fairy ring in a sunken greenhouse—feels wholly fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (fairy ring, sextant, Pleiades) are transformed through specific character stakes and sensory detail. The final reconfiguration (curiosity = memory finding home) is non-obvious and earned. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss.</comment>
