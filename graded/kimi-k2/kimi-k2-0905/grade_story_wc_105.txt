<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—collecting absences while fearing the void—drives every micro-choice; her decision to feed the forge her brother’s “echoless gap” crystallizes her flaw and costs her the illusion of innocence. The embodied emotion (palms on bark, stagger under color) grounds the arc without therapy-speak. Only the keeper’s dialogue feels slightly expository, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara pockets the obsidian shard humming betrayal, foreclosing the path of denial. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (aurora, forge, orchard) deepens the cost until the final “pale gold” of forgiveness reweights the premise. No orientation drift; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s hull-roots and salt-caked slate constrain movement and supply memory-feeding stakes; the forge’s lavender heat becomes a tactile antagonist. Aurora light funnels through cracked glass to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; only the brief “rusted keels” line risks postcard distance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens when the forge demands “what you miss most,” forcing Mara to surrender the preserved absence. The price (hearing her own complicity) is legible on the page. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the orchard drinking broken promises; no explicit thesis. The final fragrance “like forgiveness rendered in pale gold” offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the forge’s quiet tongs and the trees’ chime carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “cells divide in cambium layers” stays within a designer’s lexicon. Compression (“tasting iron in the air”) teaches the pattern early; no head-hopping. The keeper’s driftwood diction is distinct; only one clause (“face seamed like driftwood”) flirts with cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “roots curled through portholes, feeding on memory” does three jobs in eight words. Rhythm modulates from long cello sentences to the clipped “she staggered.” No loops or scaffold; metaphor coherence holds even under pressure. Minor risk of purple in “hemorrhaging russet,” but it pays off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The hearing-aid designer who hears colors and harvests absences in a shipwreck greenhouse is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. Risk-taking (synesthetic tech, memory-drinking trees) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: swapping names would collapse the emotional logic.</comment>
