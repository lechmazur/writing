<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—collecting absences while denying her own complicity—drives every beat; the final press of ear to forge crystallizes her cost under pressure. Embodied emotion (“palms on bark,” “cheeks indigo”) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The micro-choice to pocket the still-warm shard visibly forecloses denial, earning her change. Only the brother remains a cipher, so relationship crucible pressure is one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s “battered marvel” reweights her future designs and admits complicity with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (cello ember, russet drip, gold forgiveness) tightens the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation paid off when the forge converts absence into audible color. One tightening beat suffices; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse hulls, salt-caked slate, and lavender coals constrain every step; lifeboat portholes through which roots drink memory literally feed the climax. Micro-setting rule met: the obsidian flake cooling at her foot is the final charged object. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—iron taste first, then color-sound synesthesia—keeping selection purposeful. Spatial choreography never drifts; distance from forge to arch to keel remains trackable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the forge reveals her own complicity, narrowing future design philosophy. Accumulative escalation: each grafted bud, cello ember, and chiming petal layers density until the russet hemorrhage reweights the stake. No external antagonist needed; internal fracture supplies sufficient pressure. Cost is legible: she exits carrying the shard that commits her to reprogramming aids toward silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of absence as material: silence is not empty but “a cavity shaped by whatever sound has been torn away.” No thesis statements; the orchard drinking “every goodbye swallowed by storm” renders the idea concrete. Final image—trees holding “wound and blossom in the same breath”—supplies resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Only the keeper’s line flirts with echo, but subtext carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and consistent: “heard the forge as a slow cello, each ember a bruised note.” Rhythm accelerates under heat—“heat painted her cheeks indigo”—then exhales into dawn “ultraviolet into the waves.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Mara’s device-mediated ear. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, and tonally distinct from narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—sound, color, and emotional state—without scaffold: “the orchard rustled as trees tasted this fresher wound.” Figurative coherence holds; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor loop risk in “cells divide” refrain, but cadence shift teaches pattern and pays off in final blossom-wound image. Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long cello breaths to crack-glass staccato, matching heat-to-crack escalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic hearing-aid designer harvesting betrayal from a shipwreck-orchard kiln is non-obvious and inseparable from execution. Risk—color-as-sound—could collapse into gimmick, yet every image (russet hemorrhage, gold forgiveness) grows from the premise. Transformation test fails if Mara is renamed; the concept demands this exact tech-botanist fusion. Fresh inflection: trust fractures at a frequency lower than speech, turning emotional physics into design imperative.</comment>
