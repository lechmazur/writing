<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and interiority remain legible, but the story pivots off the cliff’s abandonment rather than her decisive inner turn; causality leans away</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with earned reverberation—“the ribbon of light leading out”—yet the cliff’s golden pang reconfigures path and emotion; causal chain from glass-shard mosaic to ground-softening path is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusion of geode-heart, transliterating emotions, and migrating-bird cinema feels singular; not found in any prompt recipe</comment>
