<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist’s interior contradiction—yearning to preserve while forced to surrender—grounds every beat; the sleeve-fabric tribute literalizes cost. Yet the borrowed-memory device tips toward abstraction, muting embodied stakes at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the signed spiral reconfigures the city’s memory-rule-set while the archivist forfeits personal trace. Accumulative lens holds—each shadow-measurement adds density until the final inhalation crystallizes meaning with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian stairs, bronze astrolabe, and crystal slab act as micro-settings that constrain tactile choices; the fading cloth thread charges the final image by quantifying memory-exchange rate. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors the archivist’s cataloguing gaze without tourist excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—city memory vs. personal erasure—tightens when each measurement demands a tribute, foreclosing hoarding. The spiral signature is the decisive, irreversible trade-off; cost is legible in the pale thread left behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the spiral-as-inner-ear: identity is balance wrought from echo, not ownership. Final image of footprints dissolving into general shimmer reweights earlier nostalgia with undeniable impermanence—no moralizing required.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at a distance that matches the archivist’s curatorial remove; diction (“summer-stiff quill,” “glass-calm”) is textured yet consistent. Patterned elision (“the fog became solid”) is taught early and paid off at liquefaction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the ascent; mixed metaphors are few. Occasional stacked qualifiers (“crystal whispering forecourt after rain”) slightly clot, but never near the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Frozen fog as memory-archive feels inevitable yet fresh; the spiral/inner-ear synthesis turns a measurement tool into a bodily organ, a risk that heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
