<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her thawing heart is dramatized through tactile glasswork and self-narration. The contradiction between flight and caretaking is palpable, and her final renunciation (leaving the dome) carries earned cost. One minor slip: “emotional tectonic shift” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied arc by a hair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s choice to abandon the dome crystallizes her shift from flight to stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers thaw, scent, and narration until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the abandoned safe-zone itself, now a “lighthouse” she forfeits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is no postcard; dripping panels, cardamom steam, and collapsing cornice actively constrain Mara’s choices (fuel, safety, timing). The dome’s miniature geography becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, never decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“craft safe zones for inquiry”—tightens through escalating thaw: ice becomes water, chair becomes fuel, tape becomes seam. One decisive deepening: leaving the finished dome behind forecloses escape and redefines the stake as gift rather than refuge. Cost is visible in the relinquished artifact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inquiry as shelter, grief as material to be remade. The cracked bookmark’s evolution from caution-flag to relic-floor quietly reweights memory without moralizing. Final whispered invitation resonates without stating a thesis, letting the abandoned dome carry the conceptual freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, self-aware, yet grounded in glassblower’s tactile lexicon. The dramatic self-narration motif is taught early and modulates with pressure, culminating in the soft cartographer exit. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and interiority. Metaphors (“mercury dreams,” “defeated army”) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with thaw and flame. Minor cadence repetition in self-narration is pattern-taught and pays off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of glassblowing, obsolete meteorology, and grief-recovery feels inevitable and fresh. Transformation test: the story would collapse if any element were swapped. Risky lyric self-narration heightens stakes without gimmickry, culminating in a quiet but charged abandonment.</comment>
