<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hand, burnished regret, and whispered stanza all reveal a layered, contradictory self. The final renunciation (crushing the shard) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Secondary characters remain functional props, not crucibles, so relationship dynamics are thin. Still, the micro-choices under pressure feel specific and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Aurelia dissolves into the crystal, reimagining the civilization she failed to build. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each covered mirror and recited stanza accrues until the final light-burst reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate; the asteroid’s obsidian wall anchors time and place within 120 words. No causality breaks; the shard’s harmonic chime and the archaeologist’s recorder full of poems are legible payoffs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid palace is rendered through selective, urgent detail—collapsed harpsichord, broken cello, mercury cherubs—each object constraining Aurelia’s movements. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and surfaces track as she drapes mirrors. Sensory balance favors touch and sound over visual cataloguing. The setting evolves causally: each covered mirror warms the air, signaling the storm’s passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining a lost civilization—tightens with every stanza and shard-glimpse. Escalation is accumulative: each mirror covered raises the cost of failure, culminating in the irreversible act of crushing the shard. The price is felt in Aurelia’s dissolution and the archaeologist’s sudden poetic recorder. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the final light-burst is authored by her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the shard’s facets reflect futures that never arrived, the mirrors’ veils literalize refusal to accept given reflections. The final image—ink-and-rain air—offers a non-literal answer: creation through destruction. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the orbiting universities now footnoting anonymous verses. Subtext operates in gesture (lifting the shard like a dagger) and silence (the hush after the storm).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent—each sentence does multiple jobs without clutter. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity: longer cadences for vision, clipped fragments for action. No head-hopping; the archaeologist’s single line is filtered through Aurelia’s perception. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “burnished sorrow” and “dagger of light” feel earned, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“ribbons of chronology,” “glass throat”—and serve the moment. Rhythm accelerates during the storm, then breathes in the hush. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—time visible as physical storm, revolution archived in crystal—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (failed revolutionary, artifact of power) are transformed through Aurelia’s poetic method and the shard’s harmonic memory. The final reconfiguration (she becomes the citizen of her own reimagined city) is unforeseeable yet grounded. Risk-taking (lyric structure, dissolution ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
