<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aurelio’s contradictory impulses—defeat versus symbolic action—are embodied in the bleeding shard and the scratched line; the final renunciation (“the poem remains”) is earned. Mira functions as secondary pressure, but their relationship lacks crucible force. Interiority is concrete, though a touch of diagnostic self-awareness creeps in at “footnotes could still be rewritten.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scratched line rewrites the asteroid’s future and reframes the past as “rough draft.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the mirror fissures. Orientation is taught early; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: how the shard survives the mirror’s shiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The baroque asteroid is more than postcard: mirrored halls constrain tactics (canvas covers), the amphitheater’s echoing benches shape Aurelio’s memory, and the bleeding shard becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; selective detail advances stakes. One spatial hiccup: distance between Forum and amphitheater is vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the past can be rewritten—tightens when the mirror shows Mnemosyne’s death. Agency is Aurelio’s symbolic inscription; cost is the mirror’s fissure and the future’s irreversibility. Pressure escalates once, cleanly. Secondary guild dispute remains off-stage, muting visceral stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: memory and history as editable text. Subtext operates in the shard’s blood-smear and the mirror’s shifting script. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. One near-theme-statement—“empires and revolutions alike were only footnotes”—is cushioned by embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Baroque, elegiac voice is consistent and textured; syntax mirrors temporal corrosion. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven (Mira’s question, Aurelio’s deflection). Occasional elevated diction (“chronal lightning”) fits the poet-persona. Rhythm accelerates under storm pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“time bleeding like molten ore”—barely grazes clarity. Strong sentence variety and paragraph cut discipline.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: time-archaeology meets revolutionary poetics. Mirrors as palimpsestic texts is non-obvious. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative asteroid tropes through baroque specificity.</comment>
