<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nara’s contradictory impulses—obedience to daughter’s last wish vs insurgent intent—are embodied in every micro-choice (limping cane, grafting knife nick). Her telepathy with plants is never label-speak; it manifests as tactical pressure (vine bloom, pollen nap). Final endurance—tucking altered embryo under her own heartbeat—forecloses council’s breeding path with visible cost (knees screaming, guard stirring). Interiority stays concrete, character-bound, and specific to her history.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: kite clue → coordinates → grotto → embryo rewrite → guard neutralized → council blind. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Nara’s refusal to flee crystallizes the new path; cost is the perpetual concealment under her ribs. Orientation anchors by line 3; no teleporting props. One smooth transition (dusk descent) fits 600–800 word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs constrain every beat: heat cracks amber, mineral clouds swirl, guard lulled by thermophilic pollen. Micro-setting (basin at 52°) is the literal threshold for synthetic revival. Environment guides choice—Nara times descent after crews knock off—and charges final image (volcano pulse approving/warning). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from valley to submerged grotto and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent council from fossilizing hierarchy via implanted destiny—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation tightens once: embryo altered irrevocably, council’s next lottery now blind to one rogue genome. Cost is the perpetual risk of discovery and the physical toll on Nara’s knees. No coincidence resolves; guard’s nap is earned by plant telepathy with visible pollen price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of evolving tradition emerges from embodied choices, not slogans: grafting knife = grandmother’s quilt stitch. Subtext in kite’s chlorophyll whisper and embryo’s rewritten code. Final image—“why” spoken by future child—reweights every prior beat without moralizing. Complexity preserved: council may still win, but one seed is now ungovernable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Nara; no head-hopping. Voice is textured: “tomatoes blush and cedars gossip” is character-bound perception. Compression taught early (“plank by plank”) and paid off at closure. Diction never drifts from insurgent-grandmother lexicon; even scientific terms (“epigenetic switches”) arrive via her gardening metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is selective, never muddled: “mineral clouds swirled like galaxies” serves embryo reveal. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses as guard approaches—then breathes in final paragraph. High information density: cane, kite, pollen, grafting knife all multitask. No filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes biopunk, eco-fantasy, and insurgent-grandmother trope into singular vision. Amber-embryo + plant telepathy + volcanic womb feels inevitable, not gimmick. Fresh inflection: genetic destiny literally rewritten by grandmother’s heartbeat. Risky lyric compression paid off in resonant closure. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
