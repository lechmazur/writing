<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nara’s motives, quirks, plant-mind, and insurgent past are vivid and specific—but her emotional progression is compressed; micro-choice to rewrite the embryo is earned yet the lifelong renunciation feels more announced than felt. Embodied cost (“knees screaming,” heartbeat) is excellent; internal contradiction under pressure is only glancingly shown before the moss intervention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands clean: Nara rewrites the embryo → volcano approves → council remains blind; causality under Causal lens; cost legible (time, secrecy, physiological strain), though telepathic moss narcolepsy borders coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thermal springs as living incubator, basalt grotto coordinates anchoring every beat—these settings constrain choice, temperature threshold is weaponized to open amber. Detail vivid but occasionally decorative; spatial choreography remains crisp with zero geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—freedom of a genome from predestined compliance. Stakes tighten when embryo membrane pinkens and council breeders loom, but conflict’s intensity is told (“genetic priests,” “next breeding lottery”) rather than tested in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Thematic emergence sharp: “unseal a future” versus “implanted destiny”—the final word “why” reweights the entire story with elegant conceptual reprise. Subtext stays intact, no sermons; one thematic line—“do not trust the council’s breeders”—feels like prompt echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled single POV, lyrical cadence and tactile verbs match insurgent-grandmother gaze. Chlorophyll telepathy feels integrated (plants gossip). Register wobbles slightly toward poetic editorializing (“volcano approved or warned”) near close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence-level propulsion strong with minimal loops, but figurative stacks (“mineral clouds swirled like galaxies,” etc.) run dense in a short climax, diluting clarity. No artifacts in final third that touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Insurgent granny plus plant-telepathy plus amber embryo is fresh yet coherent. Kite as living cipher and volcano as incubator feel specific to this world; risk-taking on moss sedative succeeds without breaking credibility.</comment>
