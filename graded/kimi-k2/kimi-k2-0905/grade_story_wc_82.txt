<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lantern maker’s grief is embodied in every micro-choice (breathing-in the dream, lighting the leaf) and compels her final transformation; the contradiction of holding shimmering fire while smelling only tea registers as earned psychological specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is immaculate: selling chimneys → acquiring ribbon → gem ritual → crane release; each fold compresses cause/effect while the ascending-descending stair functions as one mirrored reversal that reweights the closure with Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonstone-lens polishing method surfaces early, constrains the ritual pace (water-oil pattern), and returns as shattered dust whose scent of lavender and antiseptic remaps the basilica from architecture to memory theatre.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bidding farewell while becoming metal/leaf) tightens with each tea-bush bell; the crane flock forces stance crystallization: she must let light leave or be consumed by it, with felt loss of kerosene versus bergamot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grief itself becomes elegantly cost-conceptualized: origami as both narrative device and non-literal farewell; luminous torment is not decorative but the thematic engine by which goodbye must combust into light that others can carry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, character-specific interiority—kerosene hands, wind-chime wuriren—condenses kärnjänńa architecture: sensory register skews industrial-parental, never tourist gloss, clarifying distance with each fold of silver smoke.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm ebbs-step-breath, accelerates during crane release, never purple: “steam distilled sleep…cats teaching geometry” dissolves abstractions into mechanical chores, zero loops or template cadences within 1200 dense words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dream-shattering moonstone compresses grief-tech magic into lived tool; floating descent/ascent stair is specific reversal mechanism, not quirk. Luminous cranes fuse lighthouse craft with ritual, a synthesis impossible without these exact inflections.</comment>
