<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lantern-maker’s grief is embodied in every micro-choice—pocketing a tea leaf “out of habit,” breathing the dream into her lungs—yet the interior contradiction between holding and releasing her daughter never fully collides in a single beat; the final renunciation is felt but causally under-lit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cranes become living lanterns, reweighting grief into communal light; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, each fold tightening the emotional density until the moonstone’s dust releases the cost. The paradoxical stair and basilica logic are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and moonstone are not backdrop but instruments: the levitating stones force the paradoxical ascent, the basilica’s starlight stores winter memories that later fuel the cranes, and the moonstone’s cracked equator literally leaks the dream that becomes paper. Every setting detail constrains choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into cranes—tightens once: the moonstone cracks, forcing the maker to inhale the dream at the cost of her own last dream. Agency is crystallized in the folding; the price is the moonstone’s obliteration and the permanent exile of her private memory into public light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief transmuted into shared illumination. The cranes’ final perch in the tea bushes reconfigures private loss as communal beacon, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the basilica’s function from archive to lighthouse without a syllable of moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lantern-maker precise: “seven strokes water, seven strokes oil, whisper the name” teaches the ritual cadence; sensory bias filters every image through craft—steam as distilled sleep, starlight as stored winter. Compression like “luminous torment” is earned by rhythmic control and never drifts into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers craft, grief, and world-rule without loop or scaffold. Metaphors are integrated—“ribs holding a galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories”—and the final smoke “neither ascending nor descending, simply leaving” lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The dream-ribbon economy, paradoxical architecture, and grief-into-light alchemy synthesize into a singular vision; the risk of surrealism is justified by emotional coherence. No trope remains untransformed—the basilica is not mere window-dressing but the crucible where private sorrow becomes public constellation.</comment>
