<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marco’s interior contradiction—clinging to a 19-year-old scorch while resolving to graft anew—is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (thumb on ash, decision to sleep in the pavilion). The endurance cost is felt, yet the epiphany that “the error lay in the prophecy” is slightly too articulated, blunting the raw flaw-driven tension needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the burned edge becomes proof that verdicts, not lovers, were impossible. Causal chain holds—letter found → metaphor spoken → graft decided → new note planned—each step narrowing future options. Cost is visible in the night spent alone under saffron light, engine idling toward risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vineyard terraces, pavilion saffron, and the scorched paper filament are filtered through Marco’s professional gaze; the trellis wire that once held the letter literally guides his next graft choice, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Spatial choreography is clean; only the “vacant station” remains a faint sketch, but it serves as negative space rather than confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether anything can still grow from their labeled mismatch—tightens once: the lecture to absent Elena turns memory into future risk (tempranillo-to-chardonnay graft). The tightening is single but meaningful, cost legible in the unheard reply and the unheard-of vine pairing. Could wish for one earlier external obstacle to push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grafting as reclamation of narratives declared impossible. Final image of “stars swelling with impending fruit” reweights the burned fragment without moralizing. One slight echo risk—“destiny is only the first draft” flirts with thesis-statement, but the vineyard logic keeps it earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lingers inside Marco’s sensory lexicon—spitting seeds, tasting smoke/honey—maintaining a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm breathes with vineyard pace; no head-hopping. Compressed lyricism (“memory releases its oils when pressed”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density: fallen leaves “bruised herbs” parallel memory oils, doing double duty. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay viticultural and coherent. One clause—“the world had finished moving for good”—edges toward grandiosity, but context justifies the hyperbole as character-colored perception, not overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Romantic-exile vineyard tale is familiar, yet the unheard-of tempranillo-chardonnay graft and the 19-year ash fragment give a fresh, specific inflection. Risk is taken with an off-stage reunion, but the closure stays rooted in Marco’s actionable choice rather than wishful fantasy. Sufficient transformation to feel particular.</comment>
