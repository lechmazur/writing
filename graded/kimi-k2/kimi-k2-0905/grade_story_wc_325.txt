<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied in crawling basalt throat and trembling glove; her motive to “stand by the unremembered” drives every micro-choice, culminating in the costly act of naming each technician, which reverses their fate and rewrites her own fear into obligation. Interior contradiction—terror vs. duty—plays out in real time, not summary. The final renunciation of isolation carries visible cost as the gold lacquer transfers witness to her. No stock phrasing; voice stays specific and sensorily grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: phase transition reverses, technicians step free, signal retreats—cost is the gold lacquer now lodged in Mara and the codex, anchoring future memory. Causal chain holds: gold fleck → corridor folding → naming ritual → reversal. Orientation is anchored early (“rusted bulkhead,” “1987”) and disorientation is taught then paid off at closure. No teleporting props; every object (cable, codex, tide clock) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Facility, basalt throat, and moonlit deck constrain movement and breathing; the gold fleck itself becomes micro-setting that rewrites physics. Sensory selection narrows under claustrophobia—brine-thick air, volcanic glass scraping knees—mirroring internal state. Spatial choreography remains coherent through impossible geometry because the rule change is taught early and reverted at closure. Environment actively shapes tactics: corridor narrowing forces crawl, deck emergence permits final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the unremembered—tightens with each named technician; cost is the spreading gold lacquer that binds Mara to perpetual witness. Agency is exercised in the irreversible act of naming; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each uttered name thins the gold, increases risk, narrows options until the final reversal. Price is felt: her claustrophobia ebbs but is replaced by lifelong obligation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges from concrete acts (naming, lacquer transfer) rather than assertion. Subtext operates in the silent broadcasts of fused technicians and the hush replacing signal hum. Final image—Mara walking landward with names beating like copper strands—reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: rescue is real yet imposes unending duty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is claustrophobic, tactile, marine-technical (“phase transition,” “conduit,” “transatlantic lines”) yet lyrically compressed. Perceptual signature is Mara’s: she counts breaths, notices gold like a “star that refused to die,” feels physics rewrite. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses during crawl, longer cadence on moonlit deck. No head-hopping; interior access stays consistent and embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language (“throat of stone,” “auroral scars”) is precise and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Line-level artifacts absent even in peak beats. Final line’s “ordinary roar” recharges earlier “crashing hush” with earned reversal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Premise—haunted undersea cable station where signal devours crew—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (ghost tech, gold lure) are transformed through embodied claustrophobia and memory politics. Specificity of 1987 cable tech, gold-flecked illuminant, and tidal clock grounds invention. Final reversal (naming as exorcism) arises from established rules, not late gimmick. Risky compression succeeds without clarity loss.</comment>
