<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—methodical precision vs. grief-driven urgency—surface in embodied micro-choices (planting the seed, humming the lullaby) and culminate in an earned renunciation that redefines love as velocity. The interior contradiction is dramatized, not summarized, and the final stance crystallizes with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via the arbor’s Morse-like clanging and holds through the silver bloom’s closure. The final image reconfigures meaning—“haunted ambitions are just love that hasn’t learned how to change shape”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor, seed, and mirrored sky constrain every choice: the rails’ polarity guides planting, the seed’s heat dictates pacing, the mirrored world forces symmetry. Details are selective, filtered through Mira’s translator-bias, and the final bloom’s obsidian drop recharges the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reestablishing severed meaning—tightens via each cuneiform micro-glyph and the seed’s pulse. Agency is exercised in the planting and the equation etched into the leaf; the cost is the irreversible transformation of the seed into a bridge she must walk alone. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the departed become grammar the living must conjugate. The final reweighting—love/velocity = home—arrives through specific experience, not assertion. Subtext lives in the silver runes and mirrored sky, resisting tidy moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and translator-specific: “wedge-shaped sign for sky” vs. “sign for void.” Compression is purposeful; the lullaby’s notes measure wind shear like cuneiform measures fear. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences layer meaning (“magnetic boughs swayed, iron leaves clicking in Morse-like patterns”). Metaphors are coherent and grounded; rhythm accelerates with the arbor’s tilt. High information density without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cuneiform, magnetic arbor, and grief-physics feels inevitable and fresh. The “haunted ambitions” trope is transformed into living circuitry. Risk-taking (mirror-world symmetry, love-as-velocity) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
