<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aera’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. to release) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation (voice given to the fossil) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of her own voice). No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Micro-choice hierarchy (pressing fossil to sternum) reveals value scale with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fossil becomes a “beating node of shared memory,” reconfiguring Aera’s mission from collector to conduit. Causal chain holds: early awakening → cave heat-map → cold node → fossil → voice sacrifice → staff lighthouse. Cost is legible on page (“throat raw with salt,” collapse). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and deepens to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coastal cave is specific and constraining—salt-curtains, tide line, mineral floor warm as mammal skin. Micro-setting (fossil hovering two hand-spans above tide) directly shapes the decisive beat. Sensory hierarchy filters through Aera’s professional priorities (thermal glyphs). No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Final image recharges earlier motifs (cave walls re-illuminated).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming voice of the unknown) is signaled early and tightened when fossil demands her voice. One meaningful deepening: heat-map colors invert, forcing choice between preservation and transmission. Cost is visible (collapse, loss of voice). Agency drives escalation; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living atlas vs. memory as shared resonance. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing fossil to sternum) and silence (walls go blind). Final image offers non-literal answer—staff floating lighthouse without fire—reweighting premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; elm leaf reprise charges closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with controlled compression (“turquoise hush,” “afterburn of longing”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Aera notices through sensory-mapper bias. No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned elision taught early (“species-wide hibernation”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density (“heat-mapping emotions…factually mystical”). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid monotony. Figurative language is precise and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. No overwriting in peak beats. Grammar and punctuation clean; pronoun references unambiguous. Final line resolves by image that recharges motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-human sensory archaeologist + emotion-heat cartography + floating fossil bridge. Elm leaf fossil is transformed from relic to resonant seed; premise commits fully. Specificity anchors universals (lovers carving initials). No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk-taking (voice as weather) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
