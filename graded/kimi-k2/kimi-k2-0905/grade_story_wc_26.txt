<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—scholarly detachment vs daughter’s promise—grounds every micro-choice; her final act to swallow the stone-planet with “luminous regret” is earned by lifelong cataloguing of dusks and the filmed collision of decades. Emotional specificity sharpens when she “locked her shadow inside” and erases her footprints—choice charged with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira locks her heartbeat and unbound shadow into the vault, reconfiguring hope as unshareable. Causal chain from stone warming → viewing reels → merging timelines → ingesting shadow-planet is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens; felt cost radiates when the last dusk becomes “a violet afterimage”.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library, orchid-walls exhaling perfume, and the balcony above clouds constrain every action (no access to the drowned world). The river stone in her palm serves as micro-setting that morphs into a planet and dictates the final choice to ingest rather than drop it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single stake—keep hope unshareable—tightens when stone glows and footage proves the metamorphosis. Agency crystallizes when Mira chooses to house the shadow and erases herself; price is the loss of personal presence and the sky emptied of color.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hope as something that must not be monetized emerges from concrete acts: locking reels, ingesting planet, erasing footprints. The final image—“beautiful nothing”—reweights the theme without abstract statement; ambiguity and cost remain fully legible.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Controlled lyric compression: “orchid-walls exhaled their evening perfume,” “dusk bruise,” “stone remembering its source” all bear Mira’s perceptual signatures. Patterned elision (footprints erased) is taught early and pays off at closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Ear test passes: rhythm accelerates toward the vault and slows into final afterimage; figurative language (planet “continents of silver regret”) heightens rather than clutters. One mild loop—“luminous regret” appears twice without reconfiguring weight—limits the ceiling.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The notion that hope could be literally archived but must instead be swallowed whole is startling; the floating dream-market above drowned earth feels inevitable yet specific. Stakes hinge on refusing monetized optimism—a fresh moral calculus carried through without retreat.</comment>
