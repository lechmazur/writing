<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is precise and embodied; the stone’s warming triggers a visible micro-choice (carrying it to the vault) that escalates stakes. The final renunciation—locking her heartbeat in the drawer—earns its cost through forty years of catalogued dusks and filial promise. Shadow-as-second-heart externalizes contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. Only the mother remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira’s vanishing reweights “hope, unshareable” with undeniable social cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dusks compressed into reels, then into pulse—until the blank sky reconfigures meaning. Orientation is anchored by glass balcony, orchid-walls, vault within 120 words. No causality breaks; every beat (stone warming, reel comparison, heartbeat insertion) advances knowledge or narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass balcony, orchid-walls, and vault are tactile and selective; the stone functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. “Orchid-shelves opened their petals wider” integrates action and atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clean across balcony-vault-balcony loop. The blooming library above clouds charges the ending image without static postcard effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened when stone metamorphoses into planet. Agency: Mira’s decision to house hope inside her own vanishing forecloses the path of shared dreams. Cost is felt in the blank sky and locked heartbeat. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between shareable dreams and unshareable hope; no direct statement. Final image of “blank reel waiting” reweights prior footage comparisons with luminous regret. Subtext in the shadow’s tenderness and the mother’s off-screen choice avoids moralizing. Resonance lingers in the reader’s sense of loss and lightness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “orchid-walls exhaled their evening perfume” marries sensory specificity to POV bias. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for reflection, clipped fragments under pressure (“She set the river stone between the two projectors”). No head-hopping; interior texture remains coherent. Compression (“erasing her footprints with each step”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and theme. Metaphors are fresh yet coherent—“stone glimmered with internal starlight” sustains celestial motif. No loops or scaffold; “luminous regret” recurs with earned variation. Minor elevated diction (“metamorphose”) is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of catalogued dusks in a post-dream-sharing world feels non-obvious and fully committed. Stone-as-planet transformation grows organically from prior footage comparison. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final blank sky. Specificity—“orchid-walls,” “labeled drawers,” “violet afterimage”—anchors universals without cliché.</comment>
