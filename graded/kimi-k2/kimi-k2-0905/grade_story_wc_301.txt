<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“my hand froze on the coil”), contradictory impulses play out in real time, and the final renunciation of medication and embrace of memory carries visible cost. Backstory is woven through present stimuli and alters the stance via micro-choices (folding the map-boat). A hairline slip: the phrase “forgave the twelve-year-old” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the protagonist forecloses the path of medicated forgetting and accepts the cost of living with memory. Causal chain (river → father’s death → obsessive mapping → accordion apology → paper boat release) holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is swift; ivy-swallowed station and rusted rails anchor by line 3. Only a trace of lens ambiguity in the lyric middle does not disturb the decisive final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station’s decay and the river’s presence constrain every move: the platform offers privacy for confession, the rails’ disappearance into blackberries shapes the boat’s launch, the accordion’s patched bellows physically limits the music. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—wet coal, fox musk, phosphorescent grin—filtered through the chronicler’s grief-sharpened attention. One minor spatial hiccup: the skiff is mentioned before we see how it was reached.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens once: the paper boat is the single irrevocable act that ends the mapping compulsion. Pressure grows via the accordion’s wheeze and the graffiti’s echo, culminating in the visible cost of abandoning chemical amnesia. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict is sufficient and escalates cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: mapping as penance, music as apology, paper boat as absolution. The final image reweights the premise—maps now chart where the chronicler chooses to stay, not where water goes—without moralizing. Subtext hums in the taped bellows and the ivy’s green testament to soft abandonment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>First-person voice is distinct, tactile, grief-tinged; perceptual signature notices “green fingers prying apart brick and memory.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences under ivy whispers, clipped fragments at the boat release. No head-hopping; POV distance remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, memory, and motion. Figurative language is purposeful (“accordion…like a penitent’s cross”) and never muddles causality. A single paraphrase loop (“river carried on, polishing stones and stories alike”) is minor and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of river chronicler, taped accordion, and graffiti wisdom feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. The premise avoids template grief tropes by grounding every beat in sensory specificity and earned absolution.</comment>
