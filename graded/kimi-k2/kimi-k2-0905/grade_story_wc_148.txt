<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s contradictory impulses—yearning to absolve his father yet refusing to become silence—are embodied in the pipe and lattice; the final renunciation (“I will not become it”) is earned and carries visible cost as the reef vanishes and the lighthouse folds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower inverts, reef becomes meadow, and Silas steps onto a light-path; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, each spoken sentence literally builds the stair, and the final image reweights all prior copperlight into dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison, reef, and copper dusk are not backdrop; they constrain escape and memory, then transmute into the meadow of fireflies that charges the final image—setting literally turns inside-out to enable Silas’s exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Silas will repeat his father’s lie or author his own truth—tightens when each spoken sentence costs physical erasure of the path; the final choice to forgive yet not become silence forecloses the wolf-legacy with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited silence versus self-authored story emerges through the hush, the pipe’s iron note, and the meadow’s dawn; no moral is stated—the final image of the grass path spiraling outward offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“copper dusk settling on his shoulders like a verdict”—with perceptual signature attuned to salt, rust, and iron music; compression and elision are taught early and paid off when the tower folds without breaking coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful, e.g., “the tide gnawed back.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes, and the final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fairy-tale bones are transformed through salt-stung specificity and the inversion of the lighthouse; the shepherd’s pipe as confessional relic, the lattice that blooms iron bells—details feel inevitable and singular, not borrowed.</comment>
