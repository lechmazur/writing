<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cassian’s contradictory need to both inherit and escape his father’s echo is dramatized in embodied beats (pressing the bitten lattice to stone, stepping onto the wolf-stair). Interiority stays concrete: “chasing hush the way men chase fog” shows, not tells, his compulsion. The final renunciation—leaving the lattice to grind forever—carries visible cost: he exits carrying the hush as heartbeat, father’s voice finally silenced. One hairline slip: the father’s sudden sentience on the railing feels marginally unearned, blunting the full 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lattice-beam rewrites the reef’s history and Cassian’s identity in one image (“the wolf is me, and I am exact”). Causal chain holds: each impossible architectural quirk is a because/therefore consequence of the lighthouse’s lie-sustaining rule-set. Orientation is taught early via the salt-bitten door and copperlight repose, waived penalty. Persistent constraint—the lattice must be sacrificed—shapes the final tactic, satisfying cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse itself acts as antagonist: gravity forgets, bars sprout kelp, lens rotates without fire—each impossibility pressures Cassian’s next footfall. Micro-setting of the confessional lattice against ribs constrains movement and later charges the final beam. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track him from narrow door through spiral to catwalk without drift. Copperlight repose evolves from dusk glaze to dawn absolution, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Cassian overwrite the parable with his own truth—tightens when the father’s lies reassemble into descent stairs, foreclosing retreat. Agency is continuous: reading the mattress-manuscript, fitting lattice to lens, stepping onto impossible wolf-stair. Cost is legible: the lattice abandoned, the hush now irreversibly internal. One minor slack: the “before they find the bodies” clock is announced but never narrows tactical choices on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image, not thesis: the wolf materializes as withheld truth, reframed by the final beam. Subtext operates in gesture—father’s barnacle-buttons, the bitten slats—never explained. The ending’s conceptual repricing (“this time the wolf is me”) invites multiple counter-readings without moralizing. No echo of canned wisdom; every insight is earned through tactile struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Cassian’s perceptual filter: “the hush tasted of communion wine” is sense-bound, not abstract. Syntax mirrors obsession—long breathless clauses on the spiral, then clipped final declaration. Non-standard punctuation (em-dash chains, fragment “neither rose nor fell, only lingered”) is taught early and paid off at suspension beats. No head-hopping; father’s single line is filtered through Cassian’s hearing of “rusted shut” voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “copper blades that sliced the dark into slow-motion fins” does triple sensory work. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“timeframe pressed like tide”—slightly blurs the clock mechanism, preventing full 9. Otherwise rhythm varies naturally, paragraph cuts are surgical, and every descriptor is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Inverts the fable into a myth of inherited silence: the wolf was early, not false. The lattice-beam transforming lies into descent stairs is a fresh formalist turn unseen in retellings. Risk—architectural impossibilities as moral physics—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of salt-bitten hinges and gull-blood smell anchors universals in lived decay.</comment>
