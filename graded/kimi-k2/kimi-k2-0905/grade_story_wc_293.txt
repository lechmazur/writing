<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—bow tension mirrors emotional stakes, glass flake pulses with memory—but the hitchhiker remains a cipher, so relationship crucible is absent. The decisive step onto the shadow-bridge is earned by layered micro-choices and embodied cost. No stock phrasing; voice stays specific to her father-haunted ear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the flake’s dust re-weights “never” into “maybe” via a visible doorway. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each arpeggio adds density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by dusk, pullout, violin case within 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain pullout, guardrail shadow, and glass flake act as micro-settings that constrain her final step. Selective sensory detail—pine shadow, silver halide light—serves mood and choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from wall to gorge to shadow-door. Environment charges the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“sculpt possibility from the ashes of never”—is signaled early and tightened by each note. Escalation is accumulative: every phrase dissolves a pixel-grid square, raising cost until she forfeits the intact flake. Agency drives the climax; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of amnesty-as-creation emerges through image, not statement: pixels granted clemency from silence. Subtext lives in scaffold-wrap Morse and the father’s fatal snap. Final reconfiguration of the bridge from absence to wireframe offers resonant non-moral answer. No late thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“luminous disbelief made audible”—with rhythmic control matching bow pressure. Compression taught early (“slow photograph developing”) and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays rooted in the fiddler’s wind-tuned ear. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “the sound spilled over the guardrail, cascaded into the gorge, and bounced back as echo shaped like the hitchhiker’s silhouette.” Zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful; no mixed metaphors. Final third remains artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: violin as bridge-builder, pixels as amnesty seeds, scaffold-wrap as wind-language. Risky lyric structure holds under pressure and lands coherent closure. Specificity—“wet-plate collodion glass flake no bigger than a thumbnail”—anchors the fantastical. No derivative premise; transformation is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
