<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Asha’s contradictory impulses—her early absolutism vs. the mother’s burning-book mercy—are dramatized in the plaza’s tactile reconstruction; the renaming to “Iron Cradle” crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete (“feeling for the tell-tale edges”), and the final act of leaving the stone embodies the earned stasis. Minor: the leap from solitary cataloguer to itinerant teacher is asserted rather than dramatized, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mosaic of forgetting reweights the premise that mercy can lie in chosen amnesia. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tessera placed releases memory until the pattern itself becomes the armor. The stepping-stone’s removal is the felt cost. One transition (dawn departure) is legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The shattered-sky plaza and heat-fractured tesserae constrain Asha’s movements and supply the literal material for her map; the minaret’s circumference and cracked stepping stone are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—starlight, chipped glass, leather pouch—filtered through her tactile cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean; no static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: how to wield memory/mercy after complicity in loss. Pressure tightens once: from retrocognitive paralysis to the deliberate act of mapping forgetting. The cost—surrendering the original stone and her archivist identity—is legible on the page. Agency drives the escalation; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of placing tesserae: mercy as selective forgetting rather than universal preservation. Subtext lives in the cracked constellation that resembles arms—image reweights meaning without statement. Final image (infinite-armed figure) offers a non-literal answer to the opening question. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Asha’s tactile perception and evolving lexicon (“Iron Cradle” emerges from legend, not self-label). Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during mosaic placement, longer reflection only when motion pauses. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on perceptual signature, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., “Each tessera she placed represented a memory she chose to release”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elevation in register (“conceptual repricing” risk) is offset by grounded verbs (“cataloguing,” “pressed”). Final paragraph avoids explain-everything drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—mercy through curated forgetting rendered in shattered astronomical mosaics—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes of post-apocalyptic archivist and memory art are transformed through tactile specificity and moral complexity. Risk in the quiet, non-confrontational closure is rewarded by the charged poise of the infinite-armed figure.</comment>
