<comment>Kael’s isolation, grief-driven rituals, and guilt-read body are visceral, yet his interiority slides toward poetic diagnostics (“guilt of surviving”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The climactic corridor fold and mother-hand take occur outside POV cognition—lacking a grounded choice we witness on-page—so the final turn feels delivered rather than earned. Strong embodied cues in early beats still anchor motive.

<comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural. The corridor-folding closure is a resonant reconfiguration with mother as Charged Poise, satisfying closure definition. Temporal fold and station-phase are legibly introduced; however, the mother-manifest and corridor-fold rely on late-breaking metaphysical agency without prior causal seed in Kael’s actions, mildly loosening causality.

<comment>Deck plating colder than vacuum, gilded compass catching console-light, and photon-drifting starfield ground the micro-setting with selective sensory detail; station-phase pocket literally folds the space around the final image, charging closure under Charged Poise. Spatial choreography stays clean across corridor-into-pocket shift.

<comment>Dominant stake is Kael’s choice to surrender relativistic exile for reunion. Station-phase fold sharply narrows future options—grief transformed into exploration. Cost is felt: thirty relativistic cycles gone, jacket left as relic. Slight bump for late-fold rule shift (mother’s agency).

<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief-as-exploration rather than closure-as-resolution. “True north is whoever waits… reweights the premise without moralizing. Compass, maps, and jacket recurrence accumulate meaning that crystallizes in the corridor fold. Final-page caption is a mild theme-sentence but remains earned by image.

<comment>Consistent lyric third-person, perceptual signature of a relativistic mind noticing light-delay. Rhythm shifts with pulse/whale-song heartbeat stretch, syntax mirrors dilation. Internal voice stays coherent during hallucinatory corridor sequence without head-hop. No dialogue present; compression handled cleanly.

<comment>High sensory density; one notable loop paraphrase on “folded like paper” / “folded corridor” within a compressed beat subtracts −0.2. Phrasing remains clear, no mixed metaphors. Minor overwrought cadences (“lullaby for the blessed pariah”) but diction anchors in Kael’s vantage. Penalty only for repetition; no artifact touches closure.

<comment>Reframes “space-time station mourning” as pocket grief-engine; not a trope reversal but a fresh synthesis. Specificity of compass-needle twitch → vector-that-should-not-exist → mother-manifest feels inevitable in hindsight. Station-phase pocket and corridor fold carry conceptual risk yet land without clarity break.
