<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s survivor-guilt and filial devotion are embodied in tactile rituals (compass, sketchbook) and contradictory impulses—grief vs. need to rejoin the living. The final hand-take is earned by prior causal chain: compass twitch → voice → crawlspace → corridor. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak. Cost is visible: he abandons linear time and station life forever.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor folds, sealing the deck—an irreversible exit paid by eternal exile. Causal chain (compass glitch → hidden maps → corridor) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat reweights the stake from mourning to reunion. Orientation is anchored early by frost-rimmed window and shutdown hum. No teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observation deck’s frozen silence and star-stretch function as micro-setting that constrains Kael’s choices: only here can the compass reorient toward Mother. Sensory detail is selective—hum, frost, emergency sconce—filtered through grief-narrowed attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from window to hatch to crawlspace. The deck’s phased state supplies the final conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform grief into reunion or remain forever haunted. Pressure tightens when the compass spins—first micro turn—then escalates through voice, maps, corridor. Agency is Kael’s crawl into the hatch; coincidence (Mother’s presence) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is eternal departure from normal spacetime.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief is a temporal fold where love waits to be redrawn. Subtext lives in the compass’s “beautiful lie” and the unfinished sky. Final caption reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—are they alive, memory, or something else—yet feels coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“heartbeat stretched into whale song”). Perceptual signature filters stars through relativistic sorrow. No head-hopping; interior access remains tight. Diction stays within Kael’s plausible lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free. Metaphors (“lullaby for the blessed pariah”) are apt and non-contradictory. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional crests. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: relativistic grief pocket + maternal cartography = non-obvious closure. Tropes (time dilation, ghost-mother) are transformed through tactile specifics—compass, ration-card Orion, hatch maps. Risky fold pays off emotionally. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
