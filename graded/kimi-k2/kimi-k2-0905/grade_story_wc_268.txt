<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The titan’s interiority—“precision, not revenge”—is crisp, embodied in micro-choices (ink droplet flick, marginalia placement). Contradictory impulses (mercy vs. duty) surface only in the final line, not mid-scene, so the earned renunciation feels slightly under-cooked. Still, the single POV holds, and the cost (forgetting the man’s face) is visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Causal lens: each marginal clue tightens the trap; the ink-on-skin beat is the decisive change that strips glamour. Closure lands with unmistakable cost—the pretender’s visage melts and the titan forfeits memory. No causality breaks; transitions (spiral carrel → shattered codex) are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Library’s dust, gutter shadows, and iron-gall scent anchor space early and return in the final image (rust smell on hands). The pellet-as-micro-setting constrains the climax; its dissolution charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoration of balance—escalates through each cryptic clue until the pellet’s touch forecloses the pretender’s legitimacy. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is the titan’s erasure of the man from memory. Agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-as-drift emerges from the pellet’s journey and the titan’s renunciation; no moralizing. Final line (“every throne is only ink yet to fade”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext in marginal doodles and dust coronet enriches without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lapidary yet restrained—“regally unpretentious” in cadence itself. Perceptual signature filters every detail through miniature scale (“no taller than a candlestick”). No head-hopping; free-indirect texture remains consistent. Compression is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (moonlit alabaster, cold starlight) serve pressure without overwriting. Sentence rhythm mirrors titan’s stealth—long glides, then abrupt flick. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: miniature cosmic custodian unmasking a false king via microscopic ink rune. Tropes (hidden heir, ancient library) are transformed through scale and sensory specificity. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
