<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirel’s interior contradiction—restorer vs liberator—drives every beat; the final renunciation is earned by the needle’s tactile choices and the fox’s warmth. Embodied emotion (“heartbeat…muffled knock”) grounds stakes. Minor: the mentor’s suicide is told, not dramatized, slightly blunting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “I will no longer mend prisons” dissolves her vocation with visible cost—the mask crumbles to sand. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each knot’s sigh tightens the hush until the final dispersal. No orientation debt; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary’s starlight refracts through tools and cracks, constraining her sight and guiding the needle’s path; the net’s ancient knots function as micro-setting that stores memory. Spatial choreography is clean; glass walls vibrate in sync with pulse, charging the final leap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the fox vs preserve her calling—tightens with every unraveled knot; the last knot’s revelation forces an irreversible trade-off. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: silence pools ankle-deep, then lifts. Cost is legible in the crumbled mask and emptied net.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: restoration as imprisonment. Subtext lives in the hush and the fox’s glowing eyes; no moralizing. Final image of pawprints dissolving reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“lucid unrest”) and paid off in the final leap. Distinct perceptual signature—starlight as moving constellation, silence as tide—remains coherent. No head-hopping; POV stays interior and sensory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor (“needle…sliver of moving constellation”) serves clarity. Occasional lyrical surplus (“moonlit water”) is brief and pattern-consistent. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fox-spirit liberation reframes mask-restoration trope through tactile net-unraveling; synthesis feels inevitable. Specificity of whale-bone thread and prism refraction anchors freshness. Risk in dissolving the mask pays off with conceptual cost.</comment>
