<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marisol’s interior contradiction—wanting to erase pain yet surrendering to it—peaks when she kneels and chooses to feed the coral her own memories; the embodied cost (gift reversing, knees buckling) makes the renunciation legible. The arc is earned, but the “chef” identity stays ornamental: no culinary micro-choices or palate vocabulary shape the decisive beat, so the occupation fails to individuate her under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the desert keeps its grief but now “humming with… new growth,” a charged poise whose cost is her altered gift and the coral’s warm amber shift. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (salt droplets, copper pennies, bioluminescent regret) deepens the dominant stake until the final cadence reweights it; no causal breaks or orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fortress-after-rain and icebound coral are tactile, lived-in, and constrain every move: glass-sharp sand cuts boots, brine-soaked air dictates slowed breath, coral floor literally absorbs her palms. The coral pavilion re-appears in the final image glowing amber, charging the closing beat; environment is indispensable to tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“sandpaper rough memories”—tightens when she discovers oceanic grief too deep to erase; the single deepening forces her to surrender instead, foreclosing the original goal with visible cost (gift reversal, knees buckling). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but the stance crystallization is sufficient for 700-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image sequence: human sorrow vs. geologic sorrow, both needing witness rather than erasure. The final “secret ingredient” line risks echo, but the prior sensory particulars (bitter almonds, copper pennies, amber coral) reweight it into non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marisol’s synesthetic palate; perceptual signature is consistent (“tasting memory of every soul”). Syntax flexes with pressure—long liquid clauses during descent, short fragments at buckling—without register drift; no dialogue to test, but interior voice is distinct and stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentences carry double duty (action + sensory memory) with high density and zero paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“oceanic, vast and patient”) fits the lyric accumulative mode and never muddies causality; closure image remains crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic grief-eating chef in a fossilized coral throat beneath a desert fortress is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the inversion of her gift from extraction to donation reweights the premise without late rule changes. Risky lyric compression is taught early and pays off in the amber shift, making the sorrow-to-shelter transformation feel inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
