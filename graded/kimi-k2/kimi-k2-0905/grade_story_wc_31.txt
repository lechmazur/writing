<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jin's interior contradiction—yearning to hear color yet fearing the cost of drowning—drives every beat; the moment he seals the safe and chooses ascent, the cost (leaving the luminous vows behind) is embodied in the plankton trail he carries. The salt-stained uniform of the vanished woman anchors his motivation in unspoken grief and inherited duty. No stock phrasing; each micro-choice (dive, breathe cautiously, seal the safe) reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of pier lights singing color reweights the premise—sound was never absent, only waiting for a listener. Causal chain holds: key → safe → cylinder → realization → ascent; each step forecloses the prior one. The cost is felt when Jin leaves the submerged archive, its glow dimming behind him. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of luminous imagery tightens to the final cadence.</comment>

<comment>The sunken library constrains every move—air pockets, tilting deck, iron safe—turning setting into antagonist. The hotel key’s brass cold against Jin’s throat is a micro-setting that charges the dive. Spatial choreography is flawless: ladder left leaning, lanterns’ reflections guiding, plankton trail rising. Environment, body, and tool converge to force the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—escalates from curiosity to life-risking immersion. The tightening occurs when Jin realizes the sound has been painting him; this reframes the risk as reciprocal. Cost is visible: he surfaces alone, archive sealed, bearing only the plankton echo. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely delivers the key.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: vows survive submersion by becoming light. The lily’s vermilion whisper and the captain’s final sentence reweight earlier motifs. Subtext resides in silence—the woman’s vanishing, the sailors who never returned. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: harbor lights now burn in audible color.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “meteor hush” and “copper echo” teach the pattern early. Perceptual signature is Jin’s synesthetic bias—he tastes the key’s click as green. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Jin’s embodied senses. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences underwater, staccato ascent.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—“star-smoke,” “sleeping gulls”—and never muddles causality. High information density: “air pockets shimmered between beams” does setting, tension, and sensory work. Final line crystallizes without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—sound as light seeking witness—is fresh yet inevitable. Synthesis of festival lanterns, drowned library, and phonograph cylinder feels organic. Risk of drowning for synesthetic revelation is specific to Jin’s obsession. Transformation test: swap any detail and the arc collapses.</comment>
