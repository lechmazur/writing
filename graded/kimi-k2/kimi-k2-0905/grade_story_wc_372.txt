<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“pulse falter,” “determination crystallized”), but the mentor backstory is delivered in one reflective block that tilts the present stance only once; still, the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chief halts measurement and writes her own sentence, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sampled vow tightens the pattern until the final fogged-glass act breaks it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library, lantern, and chronometer constrain every choice; the lantern’s beam narrowing to one vow is the pivot that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is crystal-clear, and sensory detail is selective and urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“conjure meaning before oblivion”—is signaled early and escalates as each phoneme’s glow decays. The tightening choice to stop measuring and instead write a new vow forecloses the archival path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as lantern whose glass must be guarded, not the flame. The final condensation sentence reweights this without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature (“quartz hush,” “icicles of ink”) is character-bound. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and integrated (“sentences of love and warning addressed to futures that had already expired”). Rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of archival sci-fi with lyric meditation feels inevitable and fresh. The luminous-vow conceit is transformed through tactile specificity; the final inversion—archiving the archivist—carries conceptual risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
