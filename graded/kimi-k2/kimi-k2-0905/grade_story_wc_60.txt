<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s contradiction—rational skeptic yet memory-keeper—charges every beat: her refusal to cry becomes an embodied grip on the box. The moment she speaks to it “not as a skeptic but as a daughter” crystallizes interior stakes and alters tactics, releasing glass with audible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak pads the climax. Late mother/father memories are rendered rather than diagnosed, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a crystalline Conceptual Repricing: every released shard dissolves memory-as-currency, making a before/after legible under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality turns on because/therefore “with each word, a shard dissolved”, a tightening that narrows Mara’s options to let go or fracture. Cost is explicit in the emptied box. Frozen geese frame and payoff form a coherent time loop; mosaic of four fountains is taught early and transitions stay sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>City of dry fountains supplies tactile pressure—glass water, stone mouths, mirror basin—each a distinct constraint on behavior and metaphor. “Sidereal patience” is reweighted from cosmic dread to quiet release, anchoring the final image to the night sky the geese empty. Spatial rules stay consistent across four micro-settings. Occasional adjective strings (“lucid defiant hush”) flirt with overwriting but do not dull closure; selective sensory detail mirrors internal narrowing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—intensifies once per fountain encounter, cumulatively narrowing escape routes until release becomes the only live option. Mara drives each turn; coincidence merely decorates, not solves. Cost is visible on the page: empty hands, hollow box, geese resuming motion. One credible forfeiture (her lifelong resistance to feeling) alters tactics at the mirror fountain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: abandonment as cosmic weather pattern, forgiveness as letting starlight burn itself free. No meta-philosophizing; final image of risen steam answers the central question non-literally. “Defiant hush” evolves from absence to earned stillness, a tonal shift that reweights prior motifs. Resists tidy moral, permitting reader ambiguity about memory’s worth after release.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Free-indirect diction “realistically imaginative” stays inside Mara’s plausible lexicon and filters perception through embodied bias. Repetition “sidereal patience” is taught early by the box’s hum then paid off when geese resume. Rhythm varies—sparse then cadenced release lines mimic glass dissolvings—without syntactic loops. Only voice on the page is Mara’s; no head-hop.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High density, no loops or redundant restates across ~670 words. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; closing sentence reframes defiant hush from absence to acceptance. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sidereal patience”) is consistent with POV’s conceptual bent. Information moves by noun-verb pulses rather than scaffolding phrases.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen-migrant-goose device reframes memory migration in a non-obvious, emotionally resonant way. City of dry fountains reimagines grief topography without cliché; fountains that waterlessly remember defies expectation. Every trope—abandonment, forgiveness, stasis—earns specificity through Mara’s bodily negotiation with glass shards. Synthesis makes the abstract intimate and inevitable.</question>
