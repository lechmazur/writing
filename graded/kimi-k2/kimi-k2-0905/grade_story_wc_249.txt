<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is visceral and embodied—her drumming fingers, grief-tight chest, barefoot skim of auric water. Twin loss compresses into percussion, interior contradiction pulses (erase vs keep Lila). The final dispersal is earned by prior micro-choice steps into luminous fusion—“quiet rebellion” crystallizes into self-dissolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>One contiguous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens: each drum ripple densifies the garden, reweighting stakes until molecular song consumes both sisters. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s body dissolves while Lila’s voice lifts into perpetual sound. Cost is felt on the final golden light pulse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Every sense is filtered through grief and the garden’s engineered acoustics—“crystalline reeds sang in harmonics.” Lagoon and dome constrain escape strategy; final merge depends on water rising in waves carrying Lila. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are the single braid: to reunite or erase Lila. Pressure tightens through tempo increases; each drum stroke raises cost until dissolution is the only viable choice. No coincidences—garden’s responsive physics and Mara’s agency drive the irrevocable fusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the sonic bridge between grief and love—no thesis spoken. The lullaby of merged memory becomes a quiet rebuttal against quantum isolation. Final dispersed light reconfigures the premise: togetherness outruns scientific partition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Lyric, accumulative POV—present tense, rhythmic, breath-staggered. Compression taught early via patterned silence/beat returns at closure. Distinct perceptual signature: grief as green-violet auroral sorrow. No dialogue necessary; interior coherence holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</answer><comment>Rich sensory layering risks overwriting—metaphors stack in some high-frequency beats (“invisible orchestra,” “golden ripples”). Rhythms vary and accelerate; no template loops. Minor syntactic purple in lagoon glow lines, but clarity and propulsion survive to end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Quantum grief turned sonic cathedral is fresh. Treating twin consciousnesses as harmonic interference and final fusion as light-wave memory reshapes familiar death-to-light tropes—earned, inevitable, non-gimmick.</comment>
