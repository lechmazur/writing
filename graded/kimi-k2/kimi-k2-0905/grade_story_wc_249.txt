<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority carries contradictory impulses (keep vs release memories), micro-choices of drumming tempo shift the load, and her final slowed lull signals earned renunciation. Motivation remains legible yet a hairline slip in the final beat—'quietly rebellious' is named more than embodied—costs the full 9 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s communal dream veils above the lagoon, a Charged Poise that reframes identity without severance. Causal links are coherent (because serum, therefore garden resonance), but an early Orientation gap—garden geography and initial garden-rule cues arrive late—nudges down from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kinematic specificity throughout—“leaves folded into satellite dishes,” “seedpods hush-muted cymbals”—integrates setting as live instrument that constrains rhythm choices. Lack of single spatial anchor at outset caps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim ownership of her memories) is signaled early, escalates in a single tightening as each drummed beat loosens foreign griefs, and the final communal exhale carries felt cost. Agency remains hers, though escalation is single-surge rather than a stepped ladder.</comment>

<comment>Theme of communal identity grows from concrete image: memory-jellyfish departing under B-minor lagoon; no abstract labels delivered. Final image—a personal smile beneath the auroral veil—reweights premise: solitude and solidarity coexist without preach.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited internal lyric sustains rhythmic control (“tremolo of crickets whose legs were tuned…”) that modulates across pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains Mira’s synesthetic ear throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Sentences vary length, propel with precise verbs (“seedpods split,” “sapling roots aimed”); only a faint near-loop in the final drumming line keeps it from flawless.</comment>

<comment>Memory-graft rebels escaping via symphony gardens is fresh; transformation occurs through choice, not novelty. Minus a hair for audible echoes of other atmospheric biotech lyrics (“auric fluid” recalls familiar clinic tropes).</comment>
