<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her polymer lens on grief, the tactile chrysalis, the radial artery pulse—yet the final renunciation (walking away) feels slightly under-motivated; the cost is visible but the internal contradiction driving it is not fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ravine becomes an instrument, the sculptures a “physical chord,” and Mara’s relinquishment carries unmistakable social/ethical cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern taught early, cadence shift at the end—without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The braided ravine is not backdrop but constraint: water patterns teach the resin lattice, islands become pedestals, wind and warmth activate the sculptures. Micro-setting (chrysalis, shale, runoff) constrains choices and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming absence into palpable connection—is signaled early and tightened once: the decision to cast the chrysalis forecloses retreat into private grief. The cost is visible in the relinquishment of the final sculpture to strangers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: polymer science, river braids, chrysalis molds. The ending reweights separation as “a temporary braid,” a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision braided with lyric attention; perceptual signature (“fossilized moonlight,” “440 hertz”) remains coherent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop (“braided, split, and re-braided like polymer chains”) is offset by immediate payoff in insight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief therapy via polymer acoustics, river morphology, and bioluminescent sculpture. The concept commits fully; no close echoes of prior work.</comment>
