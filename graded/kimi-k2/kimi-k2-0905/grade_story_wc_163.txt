<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astrologer’s interior contradiction—scientific observer vs. ritual participant—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to exhale into the moon-pipe crystallizes the arc. Yet the ghost-partner is a narrative convenience: he supplies memory, chalk, and final pinions without ever pressuring or testing her stance, so the “belonging” feels bestowed rather than wrested. Still, her body remembers the cadence, so the endurance cost lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city inhales her breath, the paper bird ignites, and the surface world is re-weighted by an unspoken promise—cost is the forfeiture of proof (torn atlas page). Accumulative lens holds: each chalk star, feather ignition, and copepod settlement deepens pattern rather than causing next beat. Orientation is taught early through the porthole and green light; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The facility’s rusted girders, moon-pipes, and salt-eaten catwalk constrain every move; the burnt feather and chalk stars function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Thermocline power and hologram echo are learned through action, never dumped. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging before sunrise”—tightens when automatic ascent becomes live clock. The shared exhale narrows options: she gives her breath, forfeiting data-recording and tangible proof. Cost is legible in the torn page and the city’s reciprocal inhale. Ghost supplies ritual but does not escalate opposition; pressure is situational/time-bound rather than antagonistic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of telemetry into ceremony: belonging is reciprocal exhalation, not capture. Murals of whales in nebulae and astronauts in coral boats reprice exploration as mutual exile. Final paper-bird ignition offers non-literal answer—memory, not measurement, keeps the drowned alive. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the promise to return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: “constellations ripple across the black Atlantic skin” marries scientific eye to mythic ear. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under clock-pressure. No head-hopping; hologram dialogue is pulse, not spoken prose, so voice remains singular. Register stays within astrologer’s lexicon—no academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; mixed metaphors (“slow-motion arrows” of dawn) are minor. Rhythm modulates with ascent—final paragraph breathes in oceanic cadence. One paraphrase loop (“luminous respite” twice in four lines) costs the 0.1 to keep below 8.7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of drowned orrery, avian cremation flares, and astrological cartography feels inevitable yet unseen before. Risk—lyric accumulative structure under hard clock—pays off in charged poise. Transformation test fails if city, feather, or exhale swapped: specificity is total. +0.2 bonus for bold structural choice that heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
