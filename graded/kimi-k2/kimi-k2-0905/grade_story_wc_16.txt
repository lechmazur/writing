<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s paradox-driven recky caution and tri-sealed integrity are concrete and causally load every key beat; her Earned Eburnished Voice is lived and rule-bound enough to ring inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Causal arc triangulates trust-as-silence into a sonic reset; each note-signature descent constitutes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights citywide covenant at closure with unmistakable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive-body-tool continuum (ink storm, humming vault) constrains every quill stroke and final image; Aurora-well glow charges closure as stove-lid image of reopenable silence.</comment>
