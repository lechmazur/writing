<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“static crackled in her chest”), but the guilt-to-choice arc is slightly abstract; the final RELEASE is motivated yet the cost feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty amber and quiet collarbone reweight the premise with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; time-fold pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Meteor-hush sky and antique-console drawers are tactile and selective; the amber-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography clean, though “laboratory” remains more atmosphere than functional space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens through escalating sensory assault of lullaby fragments. One decisive turn: choosing RELEASE forecloses the option to erase the cry, with visible price (paper chain, empty amber).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of guilt-as-firmware emerges from constellation nodes and haunted mobiles; no explicit moralizing. Final hush reconfigures meaning without statement, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; “meteor hush,” “black silk tugged by invisible hands” teach the pattern early. Compression and elision remain legible; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language disciplined to high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; clarity intact at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Constellation tattoos as sleeper code, lost-sound lab, and amber-insect lullaby synthesize into a singular vision. Risky time-fold structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
