<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—muscle memory of the buckle, pulse against eardrums. Contradictory impulses (guard vs release) play out in real time; the final renunciation costs her the buckle and the vigil, earned by prior beats. Older self’s appearance is a touch convenient, but the momentary doubling crystallizes her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses to let the pattern continue without her. Causal chain—anomaly → recognition → decision—holds under Situational lens. Cost is legible in the dropped buckle and reset radio. Orientation is clear by line 3; no caps triggered.</comment>

<comment>“Nocturnal arbor above the clouds” is more postcard than pressure, yet the perch’s height and silence constrain every move. The buckle as micro-setting constrains the final choice; its scratches count past jumps. Spatial choreography is clean; moonlit canopy and cloud sea serve mood more than tactic, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve network vs preserve trust—tightens once the glider flashes her stolen signal. Agency drives escalation: she descends, offers the buckle, releases the post. Cost is visible in the relinquished vigil and lighter belt. One deepening, no reversals, sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust as living pattern emerges from action, never stated. The stolen signal, the dead instructor’s voice, and the relayed buckle reconfigure “watching” into “letting go.” Final image of new tally marks for releases offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through a watcher’s priorities. Rhythm modulates with tension—long sentences in reflection, clipped pulses during recognition. No dialogue, so no register clash. Occasional poetic elevation (“bruised horizon”) stays within POV’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. One paraphrase loop—“soundless echo” thrice—dulls the final repetition slightly. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. High information density; every line advances mood or motive. Minor scaffold keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: skyborne lookout meets time-folded mentor in a quiet test of guardianship. Stolen signal and older-self pilot feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky doubling pays off by crystallizing the watcher’s release. Specificity of etched scratches and false buckle catch grounds the concept.</comment>
