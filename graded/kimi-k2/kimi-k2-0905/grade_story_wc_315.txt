<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The protagonist’s vigil-keeping is fully embodied—gloved hand on the buckle, pulse as a soundless echo—so choices feel lived-in. Interiority is precise: recalling resistance to falling, feeling the buckle’s false catch. Trust revision is earned via the night-long escalation and the final surrender. Generates a believable Earned Stasis at closing.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Single continuous scene in an inferred situational lens. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final snap of the buckle reweights the watcher paradigm. Orientation anchors depth and goal cleanly within ~120 words. Escalation coheres under the chosen lens with one meaningful tightening (letting the older self land).</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sensory specificity (gloved fingers tracing metal, dawn bruising the horizon) constrains choice and charges the final release. Micro-setting— buckle as extension of body—functions as environment. Spatial choreography on the arbor branch is coherent, with moonlit reflections anchoring altitude and pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the watcher’s burden—signals early and redefines options: keep vigil versus let the pattern continue. Refusing to drop the buckle is the crucial, cost-bearing choice that exposes the network risk and drives the ending. Pressure narrows to one final trade-off and passes the test under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Trust under pressure emerges not through theme exposition but via the embodied final test where the pattern seeker accepts vigil’s end. Every silhouette crossing the moon, every click of the buckle, reprints the obsession with watching. The closing ascent—dawn tallying releases—offers a resonant, non-trivial reconfiguration of the burden’s meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice glides from crisp cataloging (“spiraling upward against all logic”) to the almost lyrical final cadence. Free-indirect tension between stillness and motion is stylistically consistent. Muscular memory as copying the instructor’s tap against her wrist heightens POV specificity and foregoes exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>No loops, scaffolds, or ornamental description. Each image propels: “bruis[ing] the horizon,” “soundless echo.” Figurative language enriches without obscuring, propulsion keeps pace with action beats, and closure beat stays crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of puzzle-code glider + identical mirror-self is unexpected yet feels inevitable, reweighting the trust theme. Risk-taking (time-folding plea) sharpens stakes and reconfigures the closure without gimmickry. Fresh inflection passed transformation test.</comment>
