<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calla’s contradictory impulses—guarding stories vs. releasing them—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, tearing the scarf). The final renunciation (letting the geometry fold away) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of the scarf, acceptance of invisible guardianship).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library re-Euclideanizes, Calla’s stance crystallizes, and the cost (scarf gone, past hours released) is legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight the stake. Pattern taught early (polaroid, call mark) and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library is not backdrop but active constraint: shelves bend, call numbers warp space, titles become questions. The mirrored endcap and shell-shaped room constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Calla’s librarian priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guard vs. release stories—tightens once when Calla utters the non-index call mark, forcing a trade-off. Agency is renunciation; cost is the scarf and the released hours. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens until the geometry relaxes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: stories endure through guardianship, not possession. Subtext in the scarf’s fray, the whispered Braille, the invisible filament. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: “someone chooses to guard the space where they breathe.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—cataloguing by rhyme scheme, “analog memories waking up,” nautilus logarithms. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are precise and consistent (comet tail of footnotes, plankton tide). Rhythm accelerates through hyperbolic corridor, then breathes at shell vertex. No overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: scientific poetry + hyperbolic geometry as literal space. Trope of magical library is transformed through Calla’s specific vocation and the scarf’s living thread. Risky structure (warped corridors, shell room) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
