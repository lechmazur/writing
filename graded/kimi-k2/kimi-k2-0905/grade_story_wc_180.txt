<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mender’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her freckled cheeks, the pollen on her fingers, the way she lifts her daughter to feel the cambium. Contradictory impulses (rage at the council vs tenderness for the orchard) coexist in scene, and her final refusal to let the elders back in is an earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s new covenant is sealed by the living ribbon absorbed into bark, a charged poise that reweights every prior vow. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beat layers image and scent until the final drift of coconut-copper fragrance reconfigures the city’s relationship to the cathedral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rafter-orchard is tactile and constraining: roots coil around corbels, sunlight stripes through absent rose-window, the scaffold’s height forces tactical choices. The micro-setting (copper gear biting bark, ribbon lashed to wound) directly shapes the graft’s success and the final covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the orchard will survive the city’s betrayal—escalates through each beat: council cuts funds, lightning scars the beam, the mender bars the doors. The tightening is felt in the hush of bees navigating scripture-like tracery and the hiss of sap meeting copper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the living metaphor: vows must rot into loam for new growth. The final drift of coconut-copper scent is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every broken promise as compost for hope, without a single explicit moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“time persisting like sap in winter,” “bees that had never known stained glass.” The lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final pollen-snow, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and consequence. No loops or mixed metaphors; even the ornate phrasing serves the accumulative cadence that culminates in the orchard’s exhalation over the city.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The cathedral-orchard grafted with copper and ribbon feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The transformation of a child’s hair ribbon into a living covenant is a risk that pays off, reconfiguring generational debt into photosynthetic hope.</comment>
