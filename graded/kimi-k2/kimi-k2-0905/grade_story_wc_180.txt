<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mender’s contradictory impulses—rage at the council’s betrayal versus tenderness for the orchard and her child—are embodied in every gesture (ribbon as pendulum, copper biting bark). Her final refusal to admit the elders until the orchard “decides” crystallizes a stance earned by prior grafting and pollen ritual. The only drag is a slight drift toward archetype (“endearingly feisty” used twice without fresh inflection). Still, the cost—sleeping seven nights under the graft, risking total failure—lands on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mender bars the doors, choosing stewardship over contract, with the living ribbon as visible cost. Causal chain holds—gear graft → pollen → sap rise → word spreads → elders return → refusal—each beat tightening options. Mosaic shards (breach memory, pouch opening, dawn graft) are legible and cohere under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors (crumbling nave stairs, absent rose window) arrive early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rafter-spanning orchard is not backdrop but surgical theater: roots coil around corbels, pollen clings to ribbon, grafted beam thrums under a child’s fingers. Sunlight stripes and vaulted shadows constrain scaffold placement and ritual timing. The copper gear and glass ampoule function as micro-settings that literally bite and bind the wound. Final image—petals snowing across the nave—recharges every prior sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the orchard survive the breach?”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each grafting beat. The decisive tightening occurs when the mender bars the doors, trading financial security for arboreal autonomy; the cost is explicit (no council funds, only pollen and copper). Agency remains hers; coincidence (fig scrolls) complicates but does not resolve. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the literal composting of broken promises into stronger roots; no character states the thesis. The ribbon’s decay into bark reweights “deciduous vows” from metaphor to metabolic fact. Final image—coconut-copper scent drifting over the city—offers a non-literal covenant without moralizing. Subtext hums in the daughter’s question and the mender’s refusal to answer directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “sap rose, hissing where it touched copper” marries sensory immediacy to emotional charge. Compression (“time persisting like sap in winter”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the mender until the daughter’s arrival, handled cleanly. Diction remains within the guild-craft lexicon without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “plaster saints,” “green applause,” “coconut and copper” are specific and non-repetitive. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long clauses for lullaby nights, staccato for grafting. Only micro-slip: “endearingly feisty curses” edges toward label, but context saves it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The cathedral-orchard graft is a fresh synthesis of sacred ruin and living agriculture; no prior story replicates this exact ecology. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—the copper gear ritual and ribbon graft are irreducibly specific. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the final fragrance reconfigures civic space without exposition. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
