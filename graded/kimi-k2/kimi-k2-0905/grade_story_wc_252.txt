<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—tenderness forged in violent docks—drives every micro-choice; the scrimshaw pressed to sternum then surrendered embodies earned cost. The “exit wound” line crystallizes her refusal to inherit Jack’s cruelty, yet the leap to communal raft-captain is asserted more than dramatized in-scene, blunting the final 0.2.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: island’s slow unpeeling mirrors Lira’s mounting resolve, whale-call cadence tightening until raft-spiral lands a Charged Poise with visible cost—bone returned, old ground dissolved. Orientation is swift; causality remains coherent as each floating timber answers the prior song. Closure beat is legible, resonant, irreversible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is no backdrop; breathing rocks and slapping waves coach Lira’s calves, whale-song vibrates through sole, scrimshaw heats against skin—environment literally steers the raft’s birth. Final spray-caught moonlight recharges every prior salt-sting, meeting the 9+ gate: setting constrains the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the island’s next shape include them?—tightens as each timber lifts; whale-call deepens the cadence, foreclosing the option to stay ashore. Lira’s sung command is the decisive turn that converts fear into cooperative push, price paid in the permanent loss of fixed ground. Cost is legible on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from bone returned to sea: plunder can be re-purposed into cradle, cruelty not destiny but material to outgrow. No moralizing—final image of unruled horizon reweights “true nature” as perpetual motion, not destination. Resonance lingers in salt-cold lungs, not abstract labels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle-distance, filtering every noun through Lira’s dock-honed sensorium—pulleys, hawsers, kelp-lock—while whale-call syntax elongates clauses like surf. No head-hop; compressions (“timbers kissed, locked by kelp and will”) are taught by earlier pattern and pay off in raft-spiral rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from short vaults to tidal rolls, accelerating breath as beams lift; no scaffold or synonym loops. Mixed metaphors are avoided—violence-to-coral, island-to-swan remain internally consistent. High density: each line carries image, motion, and emotional charge without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Weapon-to-coral rule change and floating street-city feel fresh yet inevitable; scrimshaw-as-memory-key transforms pirate trophy into empathic conduit. Risk—raft-city chasing whale choir—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight echo of “island un-mooring” trope is re-textured through dock-worker communal song, keeping it from full 9+.</comment>
