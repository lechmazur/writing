<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—duty vs. motion—are embodied in every beat; the final unmaking of the harpoon crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, voice-specific, and never diagnostic. The dock-worker grace threads through action without exposition. One hairline slip: the council’s plea feels slightly generic, not fully pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira’s refusal to rebuild is irrevocable, the kelp-fall shows the price. Causal chain holds: scrimshaw → whale call → raft → island → harpoon unmade. Mosaic shards (pier, tideline, island) are taught early, transitions legible. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe, raft skeleton, and glass-leaf orchards are not backdrop; they constrain movement and supply materials. The scrimshaw doubles as micro-setting, vibrating like a tuning fork against her sternum. Each space is filtered through Lira’s dock-worker sensorium. Final black sand sings—setting charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“freedom vs. duty”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the council waves maps. The whale’s call is not coincidence but escalating pressure; it forces the raft launch and final unmaking. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is visible in the abandoned raft and softened harpoon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: bayonet hilts into raft, kelp into shame. “Detach, and the sea will unlock you” is reweighted from slogan to lived truth without moralizing. Final image—glass leaves chiming a private song—offers non-literal resonance. Complexity preserved: freedom is not escape but refusal to translate one’s heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in dock-worker muscle memory; syntax flexes with tide-like rhythm. Compression (“torn uniforms that would never again be worn”) teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; perception stays Lira-bound. Whale call as leitmotif threads through diction without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical; every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“shimmered like a bruise”—and never mixed. Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. Occasional elevated diction (“sublittoral fringe”) is earned by context and POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Familiar post-war departure is transformed through humpback cartography and kelp-forged freedom. The disappearing island that surfaces only for those who answer a whale feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (glass orchards, harpoon unmade) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
