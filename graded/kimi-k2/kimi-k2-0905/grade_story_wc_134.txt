<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the pilgrim’s sensory surrender to the cave’s logic is credible. The clairvoyant’s renunciation—voice eroding into mineral song—carries visible cost. Motivation stays consistent: both seek magnification of the ordinary, but the transfer of sight is irreversible, foreclosing her future. Minor slip: her stagger backward feels slightly performative rather than earned by prior interior beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave seals the transaction, exit requires acceptance, and the pilgrim carries the amplified ordinary into a world that forgets how to listen. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each footprint a note in an ever-growing score. Causality holds: because the pearl dissolves, the pilgrim hears the cave’s true composition and must leave. Cost is legible in her fracturing vision and the vanished entrance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cave is not backdrop but active agent: limestone chimes, corridors branch like frozen lightning, the lake drinks light and returns music. Spatial choreography is coherent; bodies and distances track cleanly. The scar-shaped treble clef on the pilgrim’s sternum becomes a micro-setting that constrains later choice—he can no longer ignore the layered music beneath traffic. Environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnify everyday magic—is signaled early and tightened when the pilgrim must surrender observation/participation boundaries. One meaningful deepening: the pearl’s dissolution rewrites possibility, forcing irreversible exit. Cost is felt in the seer’s loss of clairvoyance and the pilgrim’s exile from the cave. Agency resides in acceptance, not reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: magic is not rare, only quiet, waiting for attention. Subtext operates in the seer’s smile—resignation bright as obsidian—and the vanished entrance. The final image of children gathering reweights the premise: the amplified ordinary turns hopscotch grids into galaxies. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is selective and biased toward sound and light. Syntax mirrors the cave’s arpeggios: “corridors branching like frozen lightning.” No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to the pilgrim until the final dream shard. Dialogue is minimal but harmonizes with the cave’s glassy music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh—“hair white as salt petals”—and never muddle causality. Minor scaffold: “steady unpredictability” appears twice in close proximity; slight redundancy but does not obscure closure. Rhythm accelerates under pressure, then settles into the final cadence.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—clairvoyant who cannot see her own future transferring sight—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes of magical caves and pearls are transformed through the score of overlapping shadows and the cost of mineral song. Risky lyric structure pays off: the cave’s music persists in the mundane world, proving magic is quiet, not rare. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
