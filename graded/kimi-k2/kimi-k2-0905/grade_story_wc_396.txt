<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—empathic seer trained to suppress feeling—drives every beat; the moment she swallows her own bottled empathy is a visceral, costly micro-choice that crystallizes her arc. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“calmly intuitive”) that momentarily abstracts the body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shard → mirrors → harbor → revocation → sphere-beacon; each step forecloses options and the final image (“orchard tasted of ripe apples instead of salt”) pays the conceptual cost of restored empathy. Orientation anchors within 120 words and the lens holds to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice floes, mirror-ring, and emotion-crates form a tactile, idiosyncratic micro-world; the lighthouse orchard constrains the dawn deadline and the mirrored trunks supply the portal mechanic. One notch below 9 only because the harbor’s spatial logic is briefly impressionistic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse the Keepers’ detachment cycle—tightens when Mara realizes the Keeper fragmented conscience on purpose; swallowing her own surplus empathy is the irreversible, high-cost turn that escalates and resolves under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: commodified empathy vs. embodied compassion, reweighted when the sphere drips feeling into future dreams. The final taste-shift from salt to apple offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person intimate carries a crisp, chilly lyricism (“face blank, eyes holes cut into parchment skin”) that stays inside Mara’s perceptual bias; no head-hopping, no register drift. Compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propel information, and avoid loops; figurative language is selective and never clogs the high-pressure beats. One strained metaphor—“images rushed together like colliding birds”—is the single hairline slip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Memory-as-cargo market and empathy-bottling crates feel inevitable yet wholly fresh; the orchard-lighthouse-mirror nexus is a bold spatial risk that pays off. The synthesis turns a familiar “restore feeling” arc into a visceral, world-specific event.</comment>
