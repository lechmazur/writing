<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—empathy vs. the Council’s refusal—are dramatized in the shard-burn and mirror choice; the final haul is earned by prior causality and costs his safety. Interiority is embodied (coat drinking moonlight, palms branded by lead line). The relationship with Sira is the crucible that forces the rescue. Flaws (hesitation, theft of shard) complicate the act and remain unresolved, charging the orchard treaty image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard pulse → mirror smash → spear throw → skiff saved, each beat narrowing options. Closure is a decisive change (ice slams shut behind them) with felt cost (net burns palms, orchard now treaty ground). Orientation is anchored by line 3 and never drifts. No teleporting props; the shard’s earlier pulse justifies its later use.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage mirrors constrain every move; the lowest terrace becomes the final treaty space. Mirrors nailed at “exact angle of regret” charge the rescue tactic. Weather (spray freezing midair) affects timing and danger. Spatial choreography tracks ladder, cliff, floe edge, terrace without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Sira’s life—signaled in the mirror vision by word 120. Escalation tightens once: shard burn → rescue race → ice slam, all driven by Kael’s agency. Cost is visceral (frozen palms, treaty net). No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates the shifting floe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges from Sira’s red sorrow streets and Kael’s bodily coordinate choice. Subtext in the shard’s “dying star” pulse and orchard treaty image reframes power without moralizing. Final lattice of frozen knives reweights prior regret motif. Complexity lingers: lighthouse may still be meaningless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “branches creaking like ship timbers,” “salt on rope.” Compression taught early (“weighted breath before reply”) and paid off at climax. No head-hopping; interiority stays in Kael’s perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual: “Sira, north by northeast…” functions as map and plea.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are coherent (ink-black water, paper-lantern fruit). Rhythm accelerates during ladder descent, then crystallizes in the treaty tableau. No register drift; diction remains within Kael’s plausible lexicon. Final line’s “net tangled around them like a treaty” is clean, resonant closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse orchard grafted onto shifting ice, empathy as cartography, mirrors as tactical tools. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring causality. Specificity (quince trunks painted white against salt) anchors the fantastical in lived detail.</comment>
