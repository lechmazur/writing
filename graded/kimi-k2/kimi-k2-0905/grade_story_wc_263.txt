<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the dreamer’s contradictory impulses—obedience to sky-warning vs. self-dissolution—play out in tactile beats. The final renunciation (dismantling then merging with the instrument) is causally earned and costly. Yet the childhood wound is summarized more than dramatized, muting the flaw’s compounding force.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky’s warning reweights every future artist’s palette, cost felt in “colorblind in the soul.” Accumulative lens holds—density of meteors, aurora, dismantled parts crystallize into a single charged image. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“brass equatorial mount… tundra”) so waiver applies; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost-coated latitude scale, violet ribbons grazing lens, circle of dark glass where snow refuses to stick—each detail constrains the next move and charges the final ghost meridian. The astronomical instrument itself becomes micro-setting, its disassembly re-mapping sky to body. Selective, urgent, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“free stardust memory or art itself dims”—tightens through each meteor syllable, foreclosing retreat. The act of dismantling the telescope is the visible price that alters tactics and enables the final fusion. One meaningful deepening suffices; escalation is coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete dismantling-to-constellation sequence: creativity must be broken open to circulate. Final image of “invitation: create, or perish, or create again” reweights earlier classroom scissors without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers—who will kneel next?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“moonstruck dreamer… hush only she could hear”) and sustained; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—sky read as Braille, migraine of unborn constellations—remains character-bound and pressure-responsive. Rhythm accelerates into breathless dismantling, then dissolves into filament light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty (image, motion, metaphor) without clog; “polar axis drop like a broken spine” is precise and propulsive. Occasional poetic stack (“ribboning through the open skeleton… liquid light”) risks purple but pattern-earned. Zero loops, zero scaffold, clean grammar; closure image unobstructed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antique astronomy with auroral creativity myth feels inevitable yet unseen; dismantling a telescope to build a human constellation is a fresh, risk-laden move. The ghost meridian as perpetual conduit for future dreamers transforms premise into living infrastructure. Specificity of brass screws in snow anchors the invention.</comment>
