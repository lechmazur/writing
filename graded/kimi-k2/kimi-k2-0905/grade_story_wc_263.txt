<comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—the dreamer simultaneously fears the instrument and drags it across the tundra—yet this tension never feels abstract; her contradictory impulses are rendered through embodied micro-choices like frost on the latitude scale and loosening the clamps. The final dissolution into stardust is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her erased footprints.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dismantled instrument becomes a cosmic constellation while the sky warns itself. Latent ambiguity (who, where, when) is taught early and discharged when the authorial gaze contracts to the gap between the two shadows, reconfiguring reader options at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Environment, body (snow on cheek), and instrument parts are treated as live constraints: the broken spine of the polar axis steers her final choice; the glass refuses snow, becoming a perfect circle of memory. Specificity never ornamental; each object narrows options or recharges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Pressure escalates via aurora descending low enough to graze the lens, forcing the irrevocable rest that will open memory; the sky’s warning reweights stakes from command to existential responsibility. One decisive tightening—dismantlement—is now sufficient for this length and resonates with cost.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>“Remember stardust before it calcifies into ordinary bone” isn’t theme-label but operational premise: the final image of unwritten months and dissolved body literalizes the price of forgetting. Closure reconfigures the reader’s sense of creativity as stardust—no tidy moral, only a crystallizing final glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: time folds like pages “slammed shut by wind,” mechanics revealed through action (“screw by frozen screw”). No head-hopping; free indirect style fuses interiority with meteors, maintaining rhythmic control under intense lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops; syntactic propulsion (“ribboning through the open skeleton of the telescope”) accelerates toward closure without figurative muddle. Occasional ornament (“migraine of unborn constellations”) is earned by thematic tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Creative synthesis: obsolete instrument dragged across tundra refigured as cosmic loom of memory. Risky dissolution of protagonist into sky earned under lyric lens—stardust recall is both consequence and creation, showing originality without gimmickry.</comment>
