<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on the damp boardwalk, the key clenched “like a fuse.” Contradictory impulses (fear vs. defiance) coexist in scene, and her final choice to wire the booth to the broadcast tower is earned by prior resourceful micro-choices. The only slight drag is the late exposition about erased lullabies; it feels summary rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: key → booth → reel → overwrite broadcast. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the city hears its own erased voices. The Orientation Test is met by word 80; no teleporting props or retro-patching. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drones pivot away, narrowing Mira’s window and raising stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon under starlight is not postcard scenery; its reflections literally become the map that guides Mira. Micro-setting details (damp planks, salt-stained tape) constrain choices and texture the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, drones, and booth track cleanly. The lagoon’s glow charging the ending image satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voices vs. erasure—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is causal: drones reappear → sprint → threading tape → broadcast hijack. A visible price is paid when Mira risks capture; the final ring across the wires crystallizes the cost. No coincidence resolves; every turn is agency-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: memory as resistance to manufactured indifference. The refrain “Indifference is a lock; memory is the key” is spoken by Mira into the tape, not the narrator, so it earns its place. The ending’s chorus of displaced voices offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thematic sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured and character-specific: “her shadow stretching behind her like an unapproved footnote.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the sprint, longer cadences inside the booth. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mira. One micro-register drift: “conceptual repricing” feels academic, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—starlight “braided into copper” charges the final image without clutter. No loops or scaffold; pronoun and tense are clean. The only near-slip is “coded freedom ringing off the hook,” but the idiom fits the telecom frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of obsolete tech (reel-to-reel), insurgent art (winged-phone stencils), and state erasure feels fresh and inevitable. The risk of a phone-booth climax in 2024 pays off because the object’s history is reweighted, not nostalgic. Specificity—magnetic reels, brass key teeth—grounds the speculative frame. No derivative echoes.</comment>
