<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (petals “tasted purple,” fracture in chest), motives intensify from memory to shared healing; the man’s silhouette darkening the glass is a micro-choice that alters the scene. Relationship crucible is brief but credible: their synchronized breathing reconfigures withheld love. Cost is felt when the jade warms and the camera vanishes. Minor slip: man’s backstory is delivered in one expository line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard passage reweights the premise that storage is posture, not place, with visible cost—camera gone, red silk empty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of breathing and projected petals intensifies until the final image glows from inside. Transitions are legible within the single scene. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Twilight viaduct, wisteria scent, and river fog constrain every breath and choice; the camera obscura’s ground-glass becomes micro-setting that literally frames the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: medicinal taste, wet-stone eyes. Final orchard reconfigures the setting into metaphorical storage. One minor spatial drift: “downstream” train is heard but unseen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens through breathing synchronization that forces shared exhalation and crystallizes into the orchard of withheld kindness. Agency is renunciation: they give the stored love back to the world. Cost is the camera’s disappearance and the perpetual ache they agree to carry. Escalation is one deepening, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: love calcifies when breath forgets reciprocity, healed only by returning it to circulation. Subtext in gesture—pressing warm tear to sternum—carries more weight than any statement. Final image of lanterned viaduct offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression is taught early (“petals drifting like slow fireworks”) and sustained; syntax mirrors inhalation/exhalation cadence. POV remains single and stable; perceptual signature is spiritually synesthetic. Dialogue is spare, subtextual: “I lost the address…” carries entire backstory in implication. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with breathing beats. One near-purple line—“scent was so heavy it felt drinkable”—earned by POV’s heightened perception. Final paragraph achieves luminous clarity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of camera obscura, Kwan Yin’s tear, and breath-based healing ritual creates fresh mythic texture. Premise of “pilgrim of sparks” is transformed from trope to lived vocation. Risky lyric mode succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
