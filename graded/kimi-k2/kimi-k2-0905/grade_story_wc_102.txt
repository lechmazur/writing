<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pilgrim’s interior contradiction—needing to offload love yet hoarding the jade bead—drives every beat; the shared breath with the stranger crystallizes a credible renunciation. Embodied emotion is vivid (“tasted purple,” “fracture knit with coolness”). Only the man’s coat-button detail feels token; his voice otherwise converges with hers under pressure, slightly flattening distinction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard door appears in condensation, they step through, and the camera’s after-image left on stone makes the cost visible. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is taught by the first 120 words; no caps triggered. One causal micro-turn (exhale onto glass → door) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wisteria scent as drinkable medicine, the ground-glass flowers, and the jade’s warming sunrise constrain choices and charge the final lantern image. Micro-setting (camera, bead, breath) functions as geography in a single-scene design. Spatial choreography is clean across the parapet step-through. No occupational detail required; river fog and iron ribs supply tactile anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the bead must be surrendered to the stranger. One meaningful deepening: the camera image sharpens into lanterns only after shared breath, foreclosing solitary possession. Cost is the camera’s vanishing and the paler dusk rectangle. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest, fitting accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of storage: love rots when hoarded, flows when exhaled. The jade tear’s re-warming and the orchard of withheld kindness reweight earlier images without moralizing. Final image of the viaduct glowing “from the inside” offers Conceptual Repricing—love as lantern fuel. No thesis statement; meaning stays implicit, inviting counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person hovers close to pilgrim perception; perceptual signature is synesthetic (“tasted purple,” “breathing changes reveal”). Patterned elision (“the memory…returned—not as image but as temperature”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm accelerates under shared breath, then lengthens into the single sustained heartbeat. No head-hopping; man’s interior accessed only through external cue of voice tremor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Figurative density is high but purposeful—each metaphor (lantern petals, green sunrise) reappears to reweight meaning, satisfying pattern-teach rule. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk—“petals drifting like slow fireworks”—but physical logic holds within dream-physics established by twilight fog.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of camera obscura, breath-work, and Buddhist tear creates a fresh angle on the “unfinished heart” trope. Orchard of unkind moments feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative structure heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Could swap names, but the specific sensorial engine (wisteria, jade, glass projection) is irreplicable.</comment>
