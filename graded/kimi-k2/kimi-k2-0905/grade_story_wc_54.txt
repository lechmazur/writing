<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s curiosity and engineering mindset drive every beat; her tactile rerouting of valves and soldering of the beacon crystallize her arc. The child’s laugh as datum zero shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, embodied, and specific to her profession. No secondary character applies pressure, but Mara’s solitary choices foreclose paths cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s “farewell” becomes “welcome” via Mara’s rerouted flows and beacon. Causal chain—sextant vibration → manifold reroute → beacon pulse—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3 and reinforced by spatial choreography. The final image of dripping light reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The peeled-back roof, dry hydroponic crater, and unmoving escalator constrain choices and supply resources. The sextant’s shadow becoming a compass rose charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara’s engineering gaze. Spatial tracking is flawless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—hope as a pipeable resource—is signaled early and tightened when Mara reroutes the manifold. One meaningful deepening: deportees become explorers via redirected flows. Cost is visible in her pre-dawn departure before applause. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: infrastructure can be retrofitted for kindness. The beacon’s ultraviolet REFUGE reweights the maze of intentions without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the child’s laugh logged as datum zero. Final image of dripping light offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—brass limbs “like a bird with a secret,” “stoic wonder.” Syntax and diction reflect her engineering precision. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and pattern-taught. Final line “departure gates can become arrival gates if someone simply re-labels the flow” crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: civil-engineering hope as literal plumbing. The carnival’s dawn exit and UV Morse beacon feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of rerouting nutrient pumps to drip light anchors universals. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
