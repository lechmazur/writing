<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s contradictory impulses—scientific proof vs. grief—are embodied in the prism’s warmth and the fracture that mirrors his own; the final renunciation (“Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush”) is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the prism’s fracture and the cleared window crystallize the cost of releasing grief. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Quartz arbor, frost-rimmed car, and prism form a micro-setting that constrains every beat; the frost patterns literally mediate the communion and charge the final image when they melt into ordinary water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be released through objects?—tightens via the prism’s rejection of lies and the arbor’s song; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost (fractured prism, cleared window).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of refracting light through sorrow; the truthful lie that objects absorb and release emotion is reweighted without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature (“glass-soft song,” “bruised violets and urgent reds”); no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance, and purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>High information density, zero loops, figurative language disciplined to the emotional beat; only minor elevated diction (“commune,” “reliquary”) that fits the mystic’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief physics, quartz arbor, and frost braille; the premise that cars hoard emotion is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
