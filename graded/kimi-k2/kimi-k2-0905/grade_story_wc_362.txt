<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s grief-anchored interiority is vivid and embodied; the prism’s warming against his chest and the fracture that mirrors his own give concrete cost to his micro-choices. The final renunciation—“Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush”—is earned by the prior triangulation of lies, prism, and frost. Slight over-articulation of the academic heresy→pilgrimage shift is the only keep from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost vein, color ribbon, and lie layers density until the hush cracks and sound returns, reweighting grief. The prism left on dashboard with its new fracture is a Charged Poise that makes the cost undeniable. Orientation is taught by word 60; no因果 breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, and frost-scratched window act as micro-setting that constrains every beat: temperature drop tightens sound, frost patterns become legible memory, arbor’s mineral breath suspends time. The car-seat-as-reliquary image charges the final renunciation. One stray adjective “urgent reds” drifts toward purple, else 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can grief be poured out—tightens when each lie flares the prism and frost rewrites her final seconds. The second lie (“You were not afraid”) freezes mist into mirrors, forcing Elian to admit need; this deepening forecloses denial and makes the fracture price legible. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but fits lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of absorption/release: objects hoard feeling so humans can survive. The truthful-lie paradox reconfigures at closure when Elian leaves the prism behind, transferring custody of spectrum to car while keeping silence. No moralizing—final image reweights all prior color/beam motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual filter: “steering wheel spinning like a galaxy” is his grief-scale, not author flourish. Syntax lengthens and contracts with the hush—compressed fragments during suspension, longer cadence during color bloom. No head-hop; prism’s warmth and fracture kept in character-sensible range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences carry double duty (action + image) without scaffold. Only one paraphrase loop (“the shifted hush deepened…paused mid-air”) and one mixed vehicle (“glass-soft song”) keep from 9+. Final line lands clean, no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frost-braille memory-reading via car-window scratches is a fresh grief technology; quartz arbor singing at temperature drop turns setting into instrument. The prism-not-as-portal-but-as-reliquary-key transforms familiar ghost-story trope into materialist mysticism. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with crystalline closure.</comment>
