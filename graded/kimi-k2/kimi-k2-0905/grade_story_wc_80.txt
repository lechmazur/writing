<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—stoic recorder vs. mourning archaeologist—drives every micro-choice; the ink-drop offering and palm-to-stone beat embody the cost of her renunciation. Motive intensifies from diagnostic fatigue to elegiac mission, culminating in the sealed confessions that foreclose return. No secondary characters dilute the crucible; her flaws and limits remain consistent, earning the final walk-away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: drawbridge rises → descent → survey → seal → emerge. Each crack inspected tightens the choice to embed memory, narrowing options until the keystone void demands direct inscription. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—her lighter inkwell signals irrevocable commitment; the cost is legible in the sealed scars and her inland departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Granite coping, dripping chains, moonlit ribs, rusted chandeliers—every detail is filtered through Mara’s professional gaze and private grief. The submerged pavilion’s spatial logic constrains movement and dictates the ritual; the inkwell’s silver cap and midnight ink become micro-settings that charge the final inscription. Sensory selection narrows under water and darkness, mirroring interior narrowing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can the lovers’ rotunda be saved?”—is reframed into “can memory be saved?” as each fissure becomes a burial site for abandoned dreams. Pressure escalates via each sealed confession; the circular void forces the climactic inscription, foreclosing any future retrieval. Cost is visible in the irreversible sealing and the emotional weight of the lighter inkwell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges from the interlaced voids and sealed words; no explicit statement intrudes. Subtext operates in the ink’s bruise on stone and the hush of chains. Final image—“already imagining future scholars…”—reweights the premise: preservation requires loss. Moral complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains locked to Mara; perceptual signature blends surveyor precision with elegiac sensibility. Syntax lengthens underwater, contracts on the ladder—rhythm mirrors descent/ascent. No dialogue needed; interior monologue stays concrete and character-specific. Diction stays within her lexicon; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “chains still dripping canal water like a reluctant farewell” compresses time, emotion, and setting. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports pressure; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Line-level propulsion carries every beat toward the final inscription.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of embedding confessions in structural repairs feels inevitable yet fresh; no prior template matches this synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image. Specificity of hydraulic lime, oil-paper, and moonlit ribs prevents abstraction. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
