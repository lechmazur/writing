<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maris's interior contradiction between duty and memory is embodied (fingertip stain, log entry), but the final cost—the voluntary surrender of personal memories—is gestured more than dramatized; still, her micro-choice to drop the flower carries visible loss and earns the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis); the cycle is broken when Maris releases the Edelweiss, paying its debt with slices of her own recollections. Causality is compressed but legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens—the gaps tighten until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mist-bound dock and tower rooms are rendered in precise sensory strokes that constrain movement and dictate how sound/light travel, charging the climax when the beam finds the ghostly stranger whole; micro-settings (rail, logbook page) double as active agents.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central stake—the cost of borrowed memory—escalates once through a deepening rather than reversal: what began as mystery becomes a debt payable only in her own past. The act of release narrows her future to lighthouse solitude, a price felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"What the sea forgets" emerges organically from Maris’s act of substitution—she gives memory so the light can remember. The theme avoids moralizing; the final beam sweeping an empty dock speaks the question louder than any statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>A distinctive cadence—fog-hums, tide-slaps, mist-swallowed clangs—marks Maris’s POV; rhythmic control tightens under pressure (“boots now silent as if moss had grown”). The lyric drift is purposeful, paid off at closure when silence is replaced by gull-scold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>High-density, propulsive lines (“read absences as diligently as any signal”) do double work; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (fog/dock/milk), register consistent with POV, and zero figurative drag in the critical beat of release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Few stories hinge an entire arc on paying debts with literal memories exchanged for lighthouse vigilance; the alpine–maritime fusion and cyclical haunting feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight, not stitched gimmickry.</comment>
