<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to keep the memory vs. release it) act simultaneously in the climactic release of the Edelweiss. The micro-choice to pin then surrender the flower crystallizes her arc with visible cost—loss of personal memories—earning the final “Repaid.” Only the stranger remains a cipher, but that serves the thematic design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maris’s act of releasing the flower reweights the premise, paying the “memory interest” and restoring temporal symmetry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each gap observed tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the line “took with it a slice of her recollection.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are not backdrop but instruments: the mist catches the beam like “milk stirred with silver,” the tide accepts the Edelweiss, and the balcony rail becomes the site of decisive action. Micro-setting (the lamp room glass, the planks) constrains movement and frames the final image. Weather and architecture actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking the memory-debt cycle—is signaled early and escalates through each observed gap. The tightening occurs when Maris realizes the gesture is a loan, not a gift, forcing the costly surrender. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence merely complicates. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between remembrance and erasure: the lighthouse must “remember what the sea forgets,” yet memory itself is a debt. Subtext resides in gesture, silence, and the final image of petals drifting like “tiny rafts.” The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to maritime detail (“tide slapped the pilings with a rhythm that left gaps”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under climax, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Maris. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—e.g., “fog hums in a bell”—and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm accelerates naturally during the release of the flower, then exhales into the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The memory-as-debt premise is fresh, and the transformation of a sentimental flower into a temporal anchor feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of setting and voice prevents cliché. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration is both surprising and earned.</comment>
