<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her reflection… beauty flawed by responsibility”), but the negotiator’s contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in real time; the final renunciation is earned yet telegraphed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing: the treaty is signed and the clipboard’s weight transforms into “fragile hope.” Causal chain holds; the ritual mechanics are legible and payoff is on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Ancient terrace” and “midsummer sun” are anchored early; the clipboard as micro-setting constrains the final signature. Selective sensory detail (cool marble, warm ebony) supports tone without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the forever war—tightens through the communal reading of the dead; cost is felt in the negotiator’s trembling hand and the collective grief absorbed by the clipboard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of redemption’s price emerges from the ritual and the clipboard’s transformation; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “garden growing in hostile soil” offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature (“celestial dance slowed”) is consistent. No head-hopping; compression and elevated diction serve the ritual tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic variation and high information density; occasional poetic redundancy (“terrible beauty of a ceremony”) is minor and does not dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar peace-ritual frame is refreshed by the clipboard-as-relic and the communal muster of the dead; synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
