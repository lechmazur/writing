<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The liberator’s patient-strategic trait is embodied in every micro-choice (testing arrow balance, decoding keys, waltzing guards). Motivation—planting resilience—drives all tactics and is paid for by the lingering chain and the scattering of irreplaceable seed. The final smile and hum crystallize earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow fired skyward reweights every prior beat into a promise of future green ranks. Causal chain holds—cipher → vault → seed scatter—each step narrowing options under the wall-clock pressure. Cost is legible in the dragged chain and the irreversible dispersal of heritage grain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival is tactile and constraining: cracked mirrors snag light, netting traps guards, Tilt-A-Whirl hatch yields the vault. Micro-objects—cellophane feathers, rusted manacles, mute piano keys—function as setting and tools that shape tactics. Final image of dust footprints spelling the chord anchors the place to the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the seed vault—tightens as regime looters approach and the wall’s fall threatens burial. One decisive turn: choosing to impede without gunfire, trading immediate safety for long-term survival. Escalation is driven by her agency under the causal lens; cost is the irreversible seed scatter and the chain she still drags.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: liberation is only the first prize; the real victory is what you plant afterward. Subtext lives in the arrow’s flight and the minor seventh spelled in dust—silent music of endurance. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing: seeds sleeping beneath ruins outlast every carnival of cruelty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded, with carnival diction (“ringmaster’s welcome,” “teddy-bear prizes”) filtered through a strategist’s calm. Syntax mirrors tension: long breaths under pressure, staccato commands to guards. No head-hopping; interior texture stays consistent even in compressed lyric bursts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free. Figurative language (“sunlight pouring in like brass band music”) is selective and tied to setting. Sentence rhythm accelerates with danger and breathes during seed planting. No redundancy; every line advances image, choice, or cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic carnival as seed vault, liberation encoded in a minor seventh, arrow fletched with cellophane. Tropes are inverted—carnival becomes cathedral of survival, chain becomes ribbon of promise. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
