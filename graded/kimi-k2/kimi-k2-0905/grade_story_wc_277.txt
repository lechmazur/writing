<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cordelia’s contradictory impulses—guilt versus agency—are dramatized in the rosewood-splintering moment; her micro-choices (loading the nib, pressing it till it breaks) visibly foreclose the old orbit and carry a felt cost. Interiority is concrete (“smelled of ink and thunder”) and embodied. The final renunciation earns its emotional weight because every beat has shown her testing the orbit’s grip. Minor slip: Dr. Orlan’s function is more facilitator than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked ellipse rewrites gravity itself, with the broken nib and “Assume tomorrow” on the window as undeniable cost. Causal lens holds—each inscription tightens the contradiction until the orbit shatters. Orientation is swift; stakes are legible by line 4. One transition (dome → funicular) is clean and thematically resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The copper dome, starlight “pooling on the slate floor,” and the clockwork projector are not backdrop; they supply the very medium Cordelia writes on and the resistance she must overcome. The rosewood nib itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice when it splinters. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can regret be rewritten?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates through each inscription. The tightening is visible: ellipse flares, cracks, becomes starlings. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. Cost is the splintered heirloom and the public exposure that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the collision of journalism, legacy, and mutable truth; no moralizing statement is required. The final image—“the story continues”—reweights every prior headline without preaching. Subtext hums in the scent of dried roses and thunder, in the silent tip of a ghost-orbit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “starlight dripped” and “gears groaned like old editors.” Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but tonally consistent—Orlan’s single line carries subtext. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during inscription, exhaling at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and idea. Metaphors (“solemn playroom for absent gods”) are coherent and earned. No loops or scaffold. Syntax varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“perihelion”) is justified by the astronomical frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of rewriting astronomical regret via proof-by-contradiction is fresh and fully committed; it feels inevitable in hindsight. Familiar tropes—guilt-ridden heiress, broken heirloom—are transformed through the observatory’s literalized metaphor. Risk is high, clarity intact.</comment>
