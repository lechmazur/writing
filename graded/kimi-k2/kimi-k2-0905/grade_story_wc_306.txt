<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira embodies the "conscience-for-hire" role with contradiction: she absorbs guilt yet resists erasing it. The tremor in her hands while decoding the final chime is a small but earned shift toward complicity. The geologist’s stance change feels proportionate and credible under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each decoded doubt thickens the air until the mirror delivers Reconfiguration—lead geologist sees live coral in the void and releases his counterfeit certainty. Closure satisfies as Charged Poise: both Mira and researchers now inhabit a costlier "maybe" rather than a settled stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cracked lighthouse and fog act as external corollary to Mira’s fraying filters; proximity to sea heightens the offshore stakes, while the wind physically unhooks their final certainty. Salt breeze and mirror shard both acquire narrative weight at climax rather than decorative texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake is clear: can manufactured certainty survive moral radiation? Each decoded chime raises the cumulative pressure until the final refusal—not removal of doubt but admission of complicity—creates visible cost. Tightening happens once, but it is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without declaration: the real risk is not killing coral beds but losing the capacity to feel that death matter. Subtext is carried in the mirror shard and wind chimes; final image of researchers "standing naked with truth" avoids sermonizing and lands as earned, resonant CR.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Singular lyricism, tuned to Mira’s perceptual bias: “salt and regret” opening line. Sentence rhythms rise and fall with fog and doubt without lapsing into ornamental excess. No POV drift; every sensory cue is filtered through conscience-for-hire vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Few loops or filler; information density remains high (e.g., wind chimes as cipher). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual unease”) never trips clarity or stalls momentum. Final paragraph achieves crystalline closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The moral-filter mercenary premise feels specific and contemporary, not a moral-issue delivery device. The wind-chime cipher system is idiosyncratic and inseparable from voice. Transformation is grounded: corporate guilt refracted through a professional conscience rather than generic eco-guilt.</comment>
