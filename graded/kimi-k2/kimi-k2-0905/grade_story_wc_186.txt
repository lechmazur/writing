<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrically specific (“retrocognition spill like hot metal”) and motives stay anchored to maternal legacy and the need to rekindle meaning; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost as she becomes the living prism, arms open. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene—only recalled—so the beat-level tension stays just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: rose light spreads and every saved voice speaks the same sentence backward, reweighting coincidence into pattern with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard gathered intensifies silence until the final refraction—while orientation is taught early through sensory cues (“glass humming pavilion,” “boots crunch on fragments”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass pavilion, desert dunes, and Joshua tree form a sparse but charged micro-setting; the fused shard between child-palms calcified by years is a tactile constraint that directly enables the final hush. Star-path navigation and salt-wind erasure track spatially; environment mirrors internal desolation without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidence bears meaning—tightens as each shard recovery deepens silence and narrows options; retrieving the “shard of hush” forecloses the desert’s soundscape, a felt price. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the final lamp-ignition reweights the stake with visible rose-light cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through refraction imagery: scattered shards reassemble into a single rose glow, arguing that apparent accidents are latent pattern. No moralizing—final backward sentence spoken by every saved voice lets the image reprice meaning without assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, rhythmically varied; wind “moan between mourning and morning” shows sonic patterning that mirrors glass stress. Perceptual signature stays consistent—custodian notices fracture warmth, star angles, calcified palms—without POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense yet propulsive; metaphor vehicles stay within optic/sound lexicon so glass, star, and hush cohere. One mixed moment—“hope in the shape of ribs” borders abstraction—but closure image remains clear; no loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse lighthouse re-ignited not for ships but for meaning-refractal is a fresh angle; retrocognition via shard-taste and sound-swallowing sliver transforms familiar quest-plot into lyric myth. Risk in lyric compression pays off when final rose glow reconfigures prior grief.</comment>
