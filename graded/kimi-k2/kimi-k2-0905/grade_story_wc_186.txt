<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“retrocognition spill like hot metal”), motives intensify toward the final stance crystallization, but the mother/child threads are told more than dramatized, softening the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rose glow reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain (prism → shards → hush → reassembly → ignition) holds under Accumulative lens; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass humming pavilion, desert, tower ribs, and prism shards all constrain movement and charge the final image; sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (prism edges “warm as if remembering light”) functions as setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens through each shard retrieval; the silence of the desert and the final rose glow make the cost visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: light as fragile continuity against collapse. Final image (rose glow “like an apology”) reweights prior losses without moralizing; subtext in the child’s calcified palms is harrowing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“tide and star argued”) remains consistent. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off in the rose-light cadence. No head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, propulsive; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. Occasional near-purple moments (“colors that had no names anymore”) flirt with excess but land within the lyric contract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic lighthouse myth is familiar, yet the retrocognitive prism, shard of hush, and rose-light rekindling synthesize into a singular, inevitable vision. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
