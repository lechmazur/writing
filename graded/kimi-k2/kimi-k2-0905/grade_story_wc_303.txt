<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her telepathy, her mother’s lullaby, the off-key singing—all embodied and specific. Motivations (weighing dream vs empire) are dramatized through the fracture choice and final renunciation. The cost is felt: she vanishes, leaving only rumor and a puddle. Minor slip: “accidental telepathy” is asserted more than shown in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she refuses to play or smash, sings instead, and disappears—cost is the empire’s anthem perforated. Causal chain (violin → fracture → choice → garden song) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by 120 words. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Velvet observatory, mulberry scent, brass, telescope, and ice violin all constrain choices—violin’s weight bows plants, fracture etched by coffee. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with stakes. Final image of iris-shaped coffee ring recharges setting. Micro-setting (violin as garden-seed) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream vs empire—tightens when fracture in destiny map forces a single irreversible stance. Escalation is driven by her agency: reading coffee, pressing thumb, singing off-key. Cost is visible—garden’s voice may survive, she does not. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of choice versus imposed order emerges through concrete particulars: the violin as propagator, the garden as unsilenced voice. Final image of iris-shaped coffee ring offers resonant, non-literal answer—freedom as “color of maybe.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise—“mulberry ache,” “fronds spelling warnings”—with rhythmic control that breathes with pressure. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Lira. Patterned lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the off-key lullaby amplification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors (“miniature galaxy” droplet) are coherent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor purple flourish in “velvet observatory” is earned by POV’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ice violin as destiny-seed, telepathic conservatory, coffee-stain cartography. Risky lyric structure holds; payoff is inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; the garden’s voice slipping through brass silence feels new yet earned.</comment>
