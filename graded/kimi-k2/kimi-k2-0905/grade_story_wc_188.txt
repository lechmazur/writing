<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Luma’s contradictory impulses—yearning to keep lighting fires vs. surrender promised to the governor—collide live in the final beat. Embodied cost stands clear: “her pockets rattling with tiny shards ready to become constellations.” Interiority is specific—her fingers drag plaster “filtering memories” rather than feel feelings. Micro-choice to weave Jax’s name into chant is concrete and stakes her courage on his safety.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a clean on-page Resonant Reconfiguration: sky cracks, hourglass sand floats rather than falls. Causal ladder holds: kerosene knot → ignited → rocket punches → star-release → governor’s sand freed, all driven by Luma’s agency. Cost is immediate: rocket leaves her satchel empty, she must keep “chanting a new route.” Lens remains Causal throughout without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Violet-gold stone petals, corked dark, drifting starlight: setting is sensorily vivid and filtered through Luma’s professional priorities of light and absence. Fortress ramparts become “spatial choreography” she must climb, constraining access. Final image’s floating sand orbiting the governor’s wrist serves as micro-setting charged in closure, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One dominant stake—break the gravity of hopelessness—tightens into a single decisive turn. Rocket fire forces immediate choice: surrender craft forever if it fails. On-page cost: empty satchel, eternal exile foregone, governor’s hourglass finally flowing. No off-stage resolution; Luma’s action punches the sky and the cost reverberates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly from the concrete act of a single firework cracking the corked cosmos. Final image of floating black sand answers the central question: playfulness is not reckless but liberating. No overt moralizing; the reconfigured sky and loosened hearts are visceral, not declared. “Serious playfulness” crystallizes as stance without summary statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical yet precise: “satchel clinking like distant thunder,” “rag knot hissing like a serpent of blue flame.” Compression and elision (“fingers dragging plaster… lost starlight pool behind eyes”) are taught early and paid off without clarity loss. Rhythm modulates under escalation without monotony; chant cadence persists as heartbeat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence adds character, image, or pressure. “Tiny ceramic shards spelling out the word ‘Remember’” reifies abstract memory into tactile object. Density high; no figurative pile-ups. Final line “no stars but promising them” lands clean without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms familiar trope of lone revolutionary into specific craft of fireworks as philosophical statement. Mosaic “remember” tiles, floating hourglass sand, blooming stone fortress—all organic, not gimmicks. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; concept commits fully without retreat. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
