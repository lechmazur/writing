<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Luma’s interiority is concrete—her worn hopelessness feels embodied—but the motivational link from “every village left behind” to her decision to ascend relies more on lyrical assertion than dramatized causality, so the final leap feels slightly under-credited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) lands cleanly on page: Luma releases the mosaic sphere, the cost is the fortress falling silent, the lens tracks accumulative texture and reweights gravity into hope; causality only wavers on the off-page past, but its present choice is sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fortress, roses, reversed fountains and torchless night provide vivid sensory scaffolding that constrains moves: the rising fountain droplets literally become fuel, while the rose walls’ final fade into song charges the costed reconfiguration—a successful micro-setting that carries closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“defy hopelessness”—escalates through the sphere’s transformation; a single tightening happens when her chant sync to heartbeat locks the spiral into orbit, and price is paid in the fortress dimming. No reversals are needed under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiant wonder emerges organically from image-choices rather than statement; the final mosaic sky acts as a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the world’s gravity without sermonizing—earned and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>A distinct lyrical diction (fountains “hover like uncertain fireflies”, ash “still remembering every spark”) remains POV-bound to Luma; the compression of chant-as-fuse is patterned and pays off in the final burst—only minor register drift (“ambient awareness filter” once jars).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Density high, rhythms ebb and accelerate with pressure; only a pair of overlapping descriptors (“serious in its playfulness” repeated twice close together) cause microscopic drag before the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The fireworks designer ascending on a staircase woven of her own flame and reversed water is a fresh internal logic; synthesis of chant / mosaic / star-creation feels inevitable after the setup and carries social charge—risk taken, coherence kept.</comment>
