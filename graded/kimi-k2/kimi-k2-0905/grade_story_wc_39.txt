<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Posy’s desire to translate memory is vivid, but the micro-choice of “pressing jar against keyhole” lacks embodied contradiction; interiority drifts into lyrical summary rather than forcing a concrete, risky decision. Closure is a gentle, luminous surrender rather than a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Drives on Accumulative/Textural lens: each jar adds density until the music box glows. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (“We are still becoming” projected on dunes) but the final cost feels contemplative rather than suffered on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Loft, dunes, and rusted box are not postcard details: the salt-cathedral and jar shelves constrain Posy’s movements and literally host the climax. The box itself, keyhole and all, charges the ending image.</comment>

<comment>Stakes—keeping fading memory alive—remain abstract. While the act carries emotional weight, escalation is more accretive than tightened; no trade-off is denied or paid visibly.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“We are still becoming” offers a non-literal conceptual repricing that echoes earlier jars and song without moralizing. Theme emerges through the ritual rather than statement, achieving restrained resonance.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect lyric texture is consistent; wind “slithers” just as thoughts “glimmer.” One brief child line is functional rather than dialogue; registers stay coherent even at emotional crest.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; salt-bleached arches and apricot salt are precise. No loops or scaffold; rhythm tightens as jars are emptied. Occasional elevated phrasing barely grazes register drift.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Vagrant penny poet jars sound memory in desert shrine: the synthesis is fresh, though some metaphor trails skirt familiar lyric territory. One unmistakable final inflection lifts the piece.</comment>
