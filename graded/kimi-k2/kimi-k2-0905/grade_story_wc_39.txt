<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Posy’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the past while laboring to release it—surface in the embodied act of bottling sounds and pouring them into the box; the final renunciation of “currency” for invitation carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her refusal to spend the pennies on bread.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing projection “We are still becoming” crystallizes the stake and reweights the premise; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with each jar tightening the pattern until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The feral loft’s salt-bleached arches and driftwood altar constrain Posy’s movements and ritual; the music box’s rusted lid and faded enamel physically resist her, charging the final image when it glows and projects onto the curved dunes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory before it dissolves—escalates through each bottled sound; the child’s request tightens the pressure, forcing Posy to risk the box’s silence; the cost is felt when the box seals without playing a tune, trading melody for collective resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete labor of translation: memory is not hoarded but offered; the final holographic phrase reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving a resonant ambiguity about ongoing becoming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The lyric, coastal diction (“apricot salt,” “kelp-stitched blankets”) is consistent and character-bound; the rhythmic rise and fall mirrors Posy’s ritual winding; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture; figurative language is selective and purposeful; no loops or scaffold; high information density (“bottled enough voices… pour them into the music box”) advances both action and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—sound-bottling as intergenerational translation—feels fresh and inevitable; the risk of a silent, glowing box instead of a tune pays off; no derivative echoes, only specific lived detail.</comment>
