<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ellery’s grief is embodied in every tactile beat; the blower, the cord, the tunnel all externalize contradictory urges to resurrect and to let go. Interiority is specific and unflinching—no stock grief labels. The final kneel and whispered “Keep it safe” crystallize a costly renunciation that feels earned. Only the wife’s off-stage chuckle risks a sentimental shortcut.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tunnel’s stored laughter reconfigures absence into echo, cost paid in Ellery’s collapse and the blower’s silence. Causal chain is tight: hourglass empty → blower revived → laughter restored → silence re-stitched. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The final image of the cord against the hourglass glass reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel’s concrete throat is not backdrop but resonating organ that literally shapes tactics—Ellery modulates throttle to sculpt echo. Sensory hierarchy is biased by grief: mechanical howl, wet sniffle, marble laugh. Micro-setting (cracked pull-cord, glass belly of hourglass) constrains the final choice. Only the suburban porch lights feel generic, a minor bleed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—faces a single decisive tightening: the impossible giggle in the tunnel forces Ellery to accept echo over resurrection. Agency is active (throttle modulation, kneel, whispered charge). Cost is visible: kneeling surrender and the blower’s final death rattle. No coincidence resolves; wind and concrete merely amplify what Ellery risks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act: tending absence is not resurrection but acoustic stewardship. Subtext lives in gesture—cord against glass, laughter stored in stone ribs. The ending reframes grief as ongoing custodianship without moralizing. No motif is decorative; hourglass, blower, tunnel all reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Ellery’s perceptual signature: mechanical metaphors, wind as lullaby, grief as dust in lungs. Syntax stretches and contracts with engine revs and emotional swells. No head-hopping; wife’s chuckle is filtered through Ellery’s hearing from stairs. Distinctive without self-conscious pyrotechnics.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “macerated itself against his ribs” does triple sensory work. No loops, no filler; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise (marble laugh, concrete throat). Final cadence slows to match exhausted engine. Only minor register drift in “conceptual throat” but it pays off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Leaf-blower requiem is a fresh, non-obvious grief ritual; no template match. Transformation test: swap blower for guitar and the arc collapses. Specificity of suburban tool repurposed as pipe organ feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky conceit fully committed without gimmickry.</comment>
