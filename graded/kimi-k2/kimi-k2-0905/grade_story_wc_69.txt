<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is rich: contradictory impulses—rage against loss and longing for harmony—pull visibly (“hummed a minor third, then lowered her voice until the resonance vanished”). The choice to sacrifice her own voice, earned by prior grief and ancestral memory, lands with felt cost (“the rosette would crumble”). Only tiny slip: two adjacent sentences restate the grandmother lineage without advancing motive; still minor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure cleanly reweights the world: “by autumn’s end the idea of enemy sounded like a note that did not belong” fulfills the Conceptual Repricing test. Cause-effect logic is consistent (rosette subtracts sound → city breathes softer); cost is unmistable as the ring turns to dust. No teleports or logic gaps. One thin spot: stakes of “entire city” scale risk abstraction, but reprise of root tone under one library keeps stakes credible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Velvet library anchors every move; cedar, crimson drapes, and moonlit glass track Mara’s spatial path. The rosette becomes micro-setting in final moment—dust ring beneath moonlight constrains the reader’s final auditory re-weighting. One near-duplicate (“velvet turned inside out” echoed in “traveled stillness”) is minor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“vanishing arts dissolve hatred across unlearning” (early signal)—deepens at mirror-stage of the roostte reflecting diminished notes; the single reversal narrows options to offering her own voice. Agency drives every beat; no off-stage resolutions. Cost scales: literal loss of the tool + permanent silence. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specific images—mulberry lattice, seventeen syllables of moth-wing language—never named as “healing racism.” Final line reframes the word “enemy” sonically, a resonant yet quiet answer. No tidy moralizing slips in.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice has velvet-and-smoke texture, cadence that breathes with tension (“crimson drapes absorbing every footfall"). Free-indirect hums and sighs are clean; no unexplained omniscience. Alliteration sometimes stacks (“velvet velvet”), but pattern taught early feels intentional and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; third-person remains anchored in Mara.</comment>

<comment>Read-aloud ear test superb. A single paraphrase loop (“traveled stillness” repeated twice across two adjacent phrases) triggers only −0.2. Otherwise high density, zero hedge verbs. Figurative language precise (cedar vs. candle smoke scent), never decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sonic subtraction and anti-hatred is fresh. Rosette not the usual talisman but a “device for erasing sound” made intimate. Ending city-wide hush earned in the single room creates bold, believable scope. No clichés or close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
