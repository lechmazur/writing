<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—rage braided with self-sacrifice—is embodied in the act of singing into the rosette; the final renunciation of her own voice carries visible cost. Motivation remains consistent: she applies to the library precisely because she can no longer speak except in questions, and her grandmother’s legacy compels the subtraction method. The micro-choice to kneel and press her ear to the crumbling wood crystallizes a hierarchy of values: communal healing over personal song. Flawed struggle is present—she must “unlearn hatred” by first hearing her own rage—yet the arc feels slightly abstract because the external world reacts off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rosette dissolves, the city’s heartbeat audibly shifts, and Mara’s silence becomes the new root tone—cost is felt in her permanent muteness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each subtracted frequency layers density until the final cadence reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate—velvet library, autumn equinox, past-closing privilege—no drift. One meaningful tightening occurs when the braid of syllables lacks a root tone, forcing her to sacrifice her own scale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The velvet library’s cedar scent, crimson drapes, and moonlit nave constrain every move; the mahogany table’s scarred surface literally receives the rosette and later the dust circle. Micro-setting—the rosette’s hollow—functions as environment, drinking lamplight and reflecting sound to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: table → aisles → nave → dust circle beneath stained glass. Weather (first frost) marks the unbinding clock without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to unlearn hatred across the hours between the last leaf falling and the first frost”—is signaled early and tightened when the braid lacks a root tone. Agency is renunciation: Mara offers her voice as sacrifice, a choice that narrows her future to permanent silence. Cost is visible on-page: “the rosette would crumble… she would leave carrying nothing audible.” Pressure escalates accumulatively as each subtracted syllable increases the silence’s weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of harmony through subtraction; no moral is stated, yet the final image of children humming the quiet scale reweights the entire premise. Subtext operates in gesture: the empty rosette is both absence and vessel. Thematic complexity is honored—hatred is not condemned but rendered “a note that simply did not belong.” Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars: seventeen syllables, mulberry dust, moonlit circle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; velvet metaphors and musical diction reflect Mara’s choir-teacher mind. Patterned elision (“traveled stillness”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. Perceptual signature is precise: scents of saffron, iron, river water released from books. No dialogue appears; the silence itself becomes speech. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences in discovery, clipped fragments at sacrifice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual weight without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—velvet turned inside out, moth-wing syllables—and serve the musical theme. No loops or scaffold; information is compressed (“ingredients of every lullaby her city had ever banned”). Occasional elevated diction (“expectantly resigned”) is voice-motivated. Final line lands clean: “a humming line of traveled stillness.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of choir pedagogy, negative-space harmony, and civic healing feels fresh; the subtraction method is non-obvious yet inevitable. Transformation test passes—plot would collapse if Mara were any profession but choir teacher. Risk is taken in the lyric, near-allegorical mode, but coherence never falters. Specificity anchors universals: mulberry wood, saffron scent, seventeen syllables. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
