<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her chilled fingers, the faint pine-tar scent of the rope, the way her father’s absence still shapes her silence. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs obedience, civic duty vs mountain courtesy) play out in real time, culminating in the costly decision to reroute the siren. The final renunciation—leaving the toggle in place—earns its weight through prior causality and visible risk. Minor: the “credibly curious” label is stated once rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s six tolls reconfigure the valley’s relationship with the mountain and Mara’s role as listener. Causal chain is tight—pressure drop → rope tug → toggle splice → bell speaks → wind calms—each beat narrowing options. Orientation is immediate; stakes and lens (Accumulative/Textural) are taught by the second paragraph and held to the final image. Cost is legible in the unauthorized act and its irreversible after-ring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The windblown sanctuary is not backdrop but agent: altitude thins breath, gusts twitch the rope, barometer tremors dictate tactics. Micro-setting (brass barometer, black bell lip, moon nailed to sky) constrains Mara’s reach and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless across balcony, stair, belfry. One minor drift: “slow whales” clouds verge on stock metaphor, but the POV’s marine-biology curiosity licenses it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Mara honor civic protocol or the mountain’s whisper?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each pressure dip. Agency is continuous: logging data, climbing corkscrew stair, splicing servo arm, pressing switch. The final bell toll forecloses annual siren use and carries a social cost (radio wonder, possible censure). One micro-turn suffices; escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ethics of listening versus broadcasting, the mountain as interlocutor rather than resource. Subtext lives in silence—Mara’s refusal to hum, the valley’s hush after the bell. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “answering when the world whispers” is earned, not asserted. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and altitude-specific: “clouds surged like slow whales,” “lip stained by a hundred years of moonrise.” Syntax mirrors pressure—long clauses in calm moments, staccato log entries as zero hour nears. No dialogue, so no risk of convergence. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—no purple stacks. Rhythm breathes with altitude and tension. Zero loops, zero scaffold, zero mixed metaphors. Opening and closing lines are perfectly pitched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—storm-siren tester who reroutes the annual test into a bell communion—feels inevitable yet fresh. Specificity of microclimate tracking and alpine dawn electric scent anchors the fantastical in the real. No trope recycling; the mountain-as-speaker is transformed through lived detail. Risk-taking (quiet climax, no antagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
