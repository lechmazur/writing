<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The painter’s interiority is vivid—her borrowed heartbeat syncs with song, her choice to dance instead of flee crystallizes her arc, and the cost of shared rather than stolen life is felt. Motivation remains consistent, but the child-donor stays off-page, limiting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the decisive shift from painting illusions to becoming a mirror is dramatized on the terrace, cost paid by surrendering her solitary practice. Causal chain (song → resonance → mirror shift) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet and rainwater droplets are not mere backdrop—they refract possibilities, constrain her movements, and charge the final cascade. Spatial choreography is clear; micro-setting (terrace acoustics) actively shapes the coded lullabies’ effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show real possibilities—escalates through each beat: song fails, dance re-weights, heartbeat shared. One meaningful tightening: she must abandon her lifelong method and accept vulnerability; cost is the loss of her former identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: the move from deception to reflection, from solitary art to communal truth. Final image of shared heartbeat and teaching others offers resonant non-moral answer—mirrors change only when the seer changes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control matching the lullaby cadences. Perceptual signature is painterly—light, refraction, color—without head-hopping. Compression (“she pressed the borrowed heartbeat”) keeps density high; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (“droplets clung like tiny lenses”) is purposeful and coherent. Final cascade is vivid without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lullabies as code, heartbeat as shared tool, mirrors as civic intervention. The transformation of mirage painter into mirror-teacher feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk in lyric fabulism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
