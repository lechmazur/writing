<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory need to both hear and silence echoes is embodied in every beat; the final choice to finish her mother’s farewell is earned by the blood-memory gift that first felt like curse. Interiority stays concrete—“taste the iron in a stranger’s blood memory”—and the mother-daughter recognition lands with visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase “richly perceptive” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s act of singing the missing cadence dissolves the cocoon and reweights the canyon’s rule-set—echoes now finish instead of loop. Causal chain holds: dream-shell → coordinates → cavern → farewell song → silence accepted. Cost is legible in the instant her own voice no longer rebounds. Orientation anchors by line 3; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The serpentine nexus and corkscrew cavern are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the shell’s hush guides descent, the breathing gallery spins sound into moth-silk, and the final shafts vent the finished echo. Sensory hierarchy—copper scent, moth-luminescence, salt-taste harmony—narrows under crisis. The fused seashell at the neck charges the last image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“ensure her own life would not become a hollow vibration”—tightens when the canyon itself questions her. One decisive escalation: the cocoon of her mother’s unfinished departure forces the choice to complete the farewell. Agency is hers alone; luck merely reveals, never rescues. Cost is the irreversible silence she now carries out of the gorge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete problem of unfinished goodbyes; the final image of drifting thistledown reweights every prior echo without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the old woman lifting the cocoon, the fused shell warm as heartbeat. The piece invites reflection on what it means to finish leaving, resisting tidy answers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “reed-blown melancholy” modulates into “forward-leaning” melody, tracking Lira’s shift from haunted to free. Perceptual signature is sharp—“taste the iron in a stranger’s blood memory”—and syntax mirrors the corkscrew descent. No head-hopping; even the mother’s words arrive filtered through Lira’s recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and mythic registers without redundancy. Metaphors are precise—“webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs”—and none clash at the climax. Zero loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s cadence releases breath like the vanished echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The echo-as-unfinished-departure conceit feels inevitable yet fresh; the moth-silk weaver and sound-cocoon transform familiar underworld tropes into something specific to this gorge. Risky lyric compression pays off: the universe’s “secret song” recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. No derivative echoes; the fused seashell is an original hinge.</comment>
