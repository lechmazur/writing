<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to preserve vs. release memory) act simultaneously in the final beats. The choice to crush the fragment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—her dissolution into the garden. Minor slip: “texture of time” drifts toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: crushing the fragment effects a Decisive Change—Elara becomes the maze, memory redevelops as sensation, and the seed in her pocket signals new agency. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each beat deepens the pattern of memory-as-botanical-impression. Cost is legible in her physical erasure and the sharpened photograph that comes only after release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is no backdrop; its vascular system literally absorbs Elara, constraining her final choice. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—moss-covered planks pulse, vines tighten—mirroring her internal state. Micro-setting (seed in pocket) charges the final image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing the erasure of memory—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. Agency drives escalation: fragment heats, bridge folds, she chooses dissolution. Felt cost scales to length: she forfeits linear selfhood. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is not possession but cultivation. The seed’s glow reweights the premise—time is clay to plant, not marble to carve. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final lullaby dissolving into music. Complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, controlled rhythm, perceptual signature of a designer who notices “toroidal waves” in hedges. Patterned elision (folding corridors, hyperbolic geometry) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; distance stable.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Syntax modulates with scene needs—short pulses during dissolution, longer coils during reflection. Minor register drift toward “retrocognitively” is isolated.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: hedge-maze designer meets living memory-garden, halo fragments as crystallized moments. Transformation test passed—plot fails without Elara’s specific vocation. Risky hyperbolic geometry and botanical memory feel inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
