<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Designer’s interior contradiction—building to remember yet surrendering to forgetting—drives every micro-choice; the final smile and deliberate re-insertion of the halo seal the cost of endurance. Embodied emotion (salt taste of future tears, cold smoke fingers) keeps therapy-speak at bay. The only limit: no second character on page, so status/relationship crucible unused, but single-POV depth sustains pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she renounces escape, roots herself in the garden, sealing the hour-tree with visible cost—future immobility, eternal abrasion of years. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pattern of fading→reconstituting photographs and recursive walks tighten the stake of “texture of time.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. Persistent constraint (halo’s price) shapes final tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Living bridge garden functions as micro-setting: the hawthorn-hourglass physically pinches sap, constrains her final choice to seal the wound. Sensory hierarchy follows designer’s eye—botanical vectors, photographic emulsion, sap drip—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: footprints fill with past selves, planks curl away in coherent sequence. Environment charges closure image; without the hour-tree’s anatomy the renunciation loses tactile cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the texture of time”—tightens when the maze straightens and the door appears, forcing a live trade-off: freedom vs. eternal witness. Escalation is textural: each turning adds a sensory memory layer, increasing density until the halo reveals the helical well. Agency visible in the final tug that rips the celluloid ring; cost is the collapsing bridge and the salt taste of future tears. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: memory as living tissue that must be metabolized, not archived. The quaking hawthorn’s celluloid rings literalize the idea without moralizing. Final smile reweights earlier terror of forgetting into acceptance of cyclical loss. No thematic echo; the door’s dissolution and re-fading photographs provide non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person intimate sustains perceptual signature: sap pulse, emulsion breath, serrated time teeth—idiosyncratic, botanically precise. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clauses for reverie, staccato fragments (“She tugged, and the ring ripped free”) at climax. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as halo light retracts to a point between her eyes. Voice remains character-bound; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences multi-task: “bark softened…pliant as photographic paper” fuses tactile and metaphor while advancing action. Figurative density is high but patterned early (Möbius, hyperbolic) so payoff earned. One mixed metaphor risk—“time grinding itself sharp”—but fits serrated conceit. No loops, scaffold, or filter stacks; final third clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: botanical topology + photographic ephemera + retrocognitive maze yields an image set not seen elsewhere. Risk of conceptual overkill navigated by grounding every abstraction in sensory botany. Transformation test passes: swap any component and the story collapses. Bold structural recursion (fading→reconstituting→refading photos) feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
