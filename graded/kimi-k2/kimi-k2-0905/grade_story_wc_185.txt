<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s motivation to “preserve the stories” and her practiced silences are embodied early; interior contradiction peaks at the center of the great dome where composure shakes. Moments of embodied cost—bone vibration, cracked marrow—crystallize stakes. The final whisper carries the earned burden of renunciation. Voice convergence with Jalen is slight but acceptable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure—carving the bloom of hush to silence the beings—is dramatized on the page, not summarized, and forecloses speech forever. The causal chain holds from “examine ice” → “read circle” → “map + stone + fractures → void”. Each absorbed word released without sound is an undeniable conceptual cost.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cavern geography is tactile and used dynamically—mineral lace trembling, bridge of petrified song. The echo chamber stone and the Mirror Pool function as micro-settings that constrain choices (silence at water, soundless breach). Spatial choreography across the final walk into the dome is precise. Setting and object directly charge the ultimate image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the last map unseen—tightens as silence hours dwindle. The bloom of hush is not just ambience; its closing circle is the final reversible choice that shrinks possibility to zero. Paid on the page as every absorbed word un-voiced itself, the cost is visible and irreversible.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Questions of presence, sound, and memory coil together beneath the dome. The silent release of voices feels conceptually inevitable, re-weighting the entire premise with the cost of future stories spoken by no one. No moral is articulated—only the final, wordless whisper of proof.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyric compression is purposeful, pattern taught by repetition of “gently luminous,” “ripple-mark,” and “hammered repose,” all of which pay off in the closing hush. Internal POV stays locked in one character with no leaks into omniscience or head-hopping. Each image is filtered through the mapkeeper’s attention, producing a singular voice.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Information density is high; single sentences braid motive, object and consequence. Figurative language never overloads the final beats; “bloom of hush,” “mineral lace,” and “refugees from the beings’ appetite” stay precise and grounded. No loops or repetition blunt the cadence. Clean proofing.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Silence grown as a cultivated artefact—ice-gardened, cricket-winged—feels internally inevitable, not gimmick. The energy beings (classic trope) are transformed into void-hungry choir mouths devouring vibration itself. The risk in making silence itself a weapon pays off cleanly at climax.</question>
