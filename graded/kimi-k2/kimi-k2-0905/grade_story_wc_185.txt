<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper’s interiority is concrete—her learned stillness, tactile handling of ice, and final whispered act all reveal motive and contradiction. Jalen’s presence supplies relational pressure, but his interiority is generic. The earned renunciation (releasing the stories into silence) carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her earlier “futures in frozen fractures.” Minor voice convergence at climax prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush blossoms, the beings fold, and the map is surrendered—cost is the loss of the archive itself. Causal chain (ice augury → scored silence → beings neutralized) holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is immediate; only one brief transition (Warden beat) keeps scope tight. No teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain every breath and footstep; the Mirror Pool and Resonance Dome are not backdrops but tactical terrain. The gently luminous lichen and echo chamber stone are micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; distances and object states track cleanly. The environment’s muteness becomes the decisive weapon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last map—tightens through the one-hour lacuna and the beings’ feeding. Escalation is a single, deepening silence that forecloses all other options. Agency is the mapkeeper’s deliberate scoring of the dome; cost is the irreversible release of every swallowed story. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory and survival: stories must be silenced to outlive their speakers. The final image—“We were here” carried by a soundless tide—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gestures: pressing the stone to Jalen’s lips, the Warden’s tremor. The bloom of hush is both literal tactic and metaphorical elegy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “hammered repose,” “batwing leather,” and “fossilized chords” feel coined for this world. Syntax modulates with pressure—long coils of description contract into the spare final whisper. POV remains locked to the mapkeeper; Jalen’s whisper is filtered through her recognition. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and tactical information. Metaphors are fresh and internally coherent (“columns of radiant static”). Zero loops or scaffold; no filter-verb stacks. The final cadence—“carrying nothing but the hush they had learned to grow”—closes with rhythmic inevitability.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The energy beings, silence-as-weapon, and cartography of memory synthesize into a premise that feels inevitable yet wholly new. Risky lyric compression pays off: the story trusts the reader to assemble the world from shards of sensory evidence. The closing silence reconfigures genre expectations of climactic spectacle. No derivative echoes.</comment>
