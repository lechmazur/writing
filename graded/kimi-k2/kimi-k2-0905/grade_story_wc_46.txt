<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is precise and embodied; her contradictory impulses—fear of isolation vs. desire to share light—collide in the pearl’s dissolution. The cost is felt in the “exact heft of a sigh” and the dulling of the glass. Motivation tightens from memory to action without abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl dissolves, scattering memory-light across the village, reconfiguring fear into calm. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each polishing pass and drip intensifies the hush until the final bloom. Cost is visible in the emptied pearl and matte shard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto’s damp walls, mist, and drip are not backdrop; they guide Lira’s micro-choices—knees ache on slick stone, mist coils to lift the shard. The setting constrains posture and supplies the final mirror, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens through each polishing circle and the pearl’s weight. The final bloom is earned by her agency; the cost is the pearl’s loss and her own exposure on the rooftop. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as burden and memory as gift; the pearl’s dissolution reframes “quiet heart” from solitude to shared stillness. No moralizing—just the final image of a woman haloed by calm villagers cannot name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded: “zephyr bloom cool” and “salt-sweet breath” feel specific to Lira’s star-watcher lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under tension, longer breaths at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors or loops. The final line “weighing nothing, lighting everything” crystallizes prior motifs with zero slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of sea glass, pearl, and memory-light feels inevitable yet fresh; the trope of “light without fire” is transformed through tactile ritual and communal hush. Specificity—calcite veins, driftwood tongs—anchors the concept in lived detail.</comment>
