<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mateo’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the diary, wire, and root choices reveal a hierarchy of values. The final self-wiring is earned by prior systematic care and the bat epiphany. Minor slip: “gently systematic” is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mateo’s self-closure into the circuit dissolves his six-month horizon and hands the remodel forward. Causal chain (diary → copper → root → light) holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the sealed diary and the woman’s inheritance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Living stone pillars, salt wind, and copper wire are tactile and selective; the orchard’s nave constrains every move. Final lantern image recharges the setting as both ruin and renewal. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete multispecies collaboration before death—tightens through each node repair and species negotiation. One meaningful deepening: Mateo’s own pulse becomes the final node, foreclosing solitary death. Cost is visible in fatigue and the sealed diary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies architecture emerges through concrete grafts, circuits, and negotiations; no moralizing. Final line “Architecture is only complete when it forgets the architect” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Resonance lingers without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mateo’s perceptual signature—lichen heartbeat, root pressure. Syntax mirrors his systematic yet lyrical mind. No head-hopping; the woman’s arrival is external and brief, preserving lens integrity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers biology, craft, and emotion. Metaphors (stone skin, brazen calm) are precise and consistent. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates toward the final hum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Grafting colonial stone into living parliament is fresh; the copper-bio circuit feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Transformation test passed—story would collapse without fig-root architecture. Risky lyric compression pays off in the lantern image.</comment>
