<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s shift from destitution to tactile guide is embodied and earned; the glass-warm-skin moment crystallizes his arc. Lira’s single question (“does transformation hurt…”) lands as genuine pressure, not exposition. Interiority stays concrete, though the “texture of transformation” refrain flirts with label-speak. Cost is felt in the glowing footprints he can never reclaim.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lava staircase cools into a path of orchids, a visible price that reweights the premise. Causality is situational—coincidence complicates, then crystallizes choice—yet the lens holds to the final image. The mountain’s molten choreography letting them pass fulfills the prophecy with on-page cost. No orientation debt; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Black sand, twin moons, and volcanic glass are not backdrop but active agents: the beach births the lean-to, the cave mirror reconfigures identity. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch—glass warming into skin—guiding the final choice. Spatial choreography is flawless; lava cools into steps that track causally. The orchid seedlings literalize setting as legacy, charging the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can giving survive total loss?—tightens when Kael releases the last salvageable light. The detour inland is the single pressure point: every footfall lands on cooled stone, forcing stance crystallization. Coincidence (bugs orchestrating shelter) complicates rather than rescues. Cost is the irreversible footprint trail, a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: transformation as medium, not threshold. The eclipse, lightning-bug constellation, and glass-skin cave enact the idea without naming it. Subtext pulses in Lira’s question and Kael’s silent answer. Final image—orchids sprouting from glowing footprints—offers a non-literal, charged answer to “what remains after everything is given away?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Kael’s perceptual signature; volcanic hush and glassy warmth are filtered through his bias. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior is implied, not ventriloquized. Syntax breathes with pressure—short clauses during tremors, longer coils in the cave. Diction is precise: “viscous glow that tasted of salt and metamorphosis” is character-bound, not purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, character, or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—lava as “ribbon,” glass as “skin”—and physically consistent. High information density: “cooled stone” and “fire-resistant orchids” do world-building work without exposition. Final cadence slows to match the mountain’s heartbeat, then tightens again on descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—destitute philanthropist guided by released light—feels fresh because grounded in tactile consequence. Volcano as crucible and oracle is a transformed trope; the lava staircase literalizes myth without exposition. Specificity anchors universals: obsidian shards clinking like a bell, orchid vines curtaining a cave mouth. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final footprint-orchid image.</comment>
