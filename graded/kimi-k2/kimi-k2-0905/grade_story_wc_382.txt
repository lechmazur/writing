<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority crackles with paradoxical aliveness of the tutor who “was never alive the way I assumed.” Contradictory motives—loneliness masked as pedagogy—drive every beat until the final “stay” costs the narrator permanence as keeper of lies. Embodied moments (pressing warm brass to limestone, owl wax print) sharpen stakes. The micro-choice to knock on Mrs Chen’s door crystallizes a new crucible with felt solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: narrator inherits the tutor’s mantle to become “next keeper of agreed upon lies.” Meteor shower in perfect hexameter externalizes grammar while rooftop sighs provide architectural cost. Because/therefore links (tutor vanishing → seal pressed second time → gargoyle speaks) tighten until the final “stay” recharges the entire pattern. Orientation, causality, and cost remain intact to final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rooftop garden—fire escape railing, potted rosemary, meteor-scratched sky—constrains the final choice when it “weighed on its shoulders like an ill-fitting crown” and prompts the building’s confession. Desk seal’s brass warmth and owl engraving materially charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is lucid across every climb, lean, and descent; micro-setting (desk seal, limestone, sugar jar) directly shapes the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who will inherit guardianship of architectural memory—escalates from gentle Tuesday teas to the tutor’s dissolve and gargoyle’s greeting. Each new layer of lie (“I was never alive”) narrows options, ending in irreplaceable solitude. Cost is visible on-page: the rooftop’s burden and the narrator’s locked Tuesday ritual with Mrs Chen. Agency remains in each agreement to fabricate company.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of sanctioned deceit emerges not as thesis but via meteor-fire hexameters and waxy brass “stay.” Subtext in sugar ritual, rooftop crown and “agreed upon lie” crystallize without explication. The reader reweights solitude as the ultimate architecture—the building finally fluently “understood.” Final line recharges earlier motifs, delivering resonance without moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single, sustained hallucinatory lyricism—“meteor scratched silver signature” and “grammar of cracked brick”—holds perceptual signature and psychic distance. Metaphors serve pressure rather than ornament; diction stays within intimate rooftop intimacy yet retains lexical surprise. No head-hopping; voice remains nimble when limestone speaks: “Welcome, new linguist.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lines advance via concrete objects (“antique desk seal clinked softly”) and sensory specificity (“tea scented with jasmine”). No looped phrasing; each sentence doubles as story and music. High information density—“future perfect of load-bearing walls”—compresses concept without obscuring. Read-aloud rhythm adapts to meteor fall then hush.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of linguist-for-hire who trades Latin for architectural memory, then dissolves, is utterly specific, not templated. Metamorphoses familiar meteor shower into dactylic fire grammar; rooftop garden becomes character. Tutor-gargoyle-Mrs Chen nexus generates freshness impossible to swap out. Entire story feels inevitable once “agreed upon lies” is uttered.</comment>
