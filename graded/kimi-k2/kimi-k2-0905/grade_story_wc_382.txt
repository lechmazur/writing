<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“steam rose like incense between us”), yet the climactic acceptance of the tutor’s mantle feels slightly under-motivated; the shift from learner to keeper happens in a single beat without prior micro-choices that foreclose other paths. The tutor’s transparency is poignant, but her agency is mostly expository rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator becomes the new linguist, sealing the generational transfer with the brass owl. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each meteor, lie, and borrowed cup layers until the rooftop “hummed, finally fluent.” Cost is felt in the tutor’s vanishing and the narrator’s unasked-for inheritance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden, meteor shower, and limestone gargoyle are not mere backdrop; they constrain action (the seal must be pressed to stone) and charge the final image (“the building hummed”). Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful—rosemary scent, brass warmth—without clutter. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learning to hear buildings—tightens when the tutor demands the narrator “listen until the limestone spoke,” forcing a decisive stance crystallization. The meteor shower intensifies in perfect hexameter, a cadence shift that reweights the task. The cost is the tutor’s disappearance and the narrator’s irreversible new burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the agreed-upon lies: language as shelter and erasure. The final image of steam spelling “stay” reweights every prior lie without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures—the seal’s waxy imprint, the gargoyle’s grinding turn—inviting reflection on memory and stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“meteors now fell in perfect Latin hexameter”). Perceptual signature is consistent—rosemary, soot, brass warmth filtered through a linguist’s ear. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable even as the tutor dissolves.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional lyric compression (“the grammar of cracked brick”) is earned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the building’s settling sigh, achieving closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a dead language tutor who teaches buildings to speak is fresh and fully committed. Meteors conjugating Latin in the sky synthesizes cosmic scale with intimate loss. The transformation of the borrowed-sugar ritual into generational succession feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
