<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sister-phoenix bond is vividly embodied; the narrator’s micro-choices (cutting palms, inhaling spices, stepping into the circle) all flow from a single, escalating motive. Interiority is concrete, contradictory (fighting the change while courting it), and culminates in a costly fusion. Minor drift: the “beast whisperer” label is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged guardian rises with felt cost—the forfeiture of separate selves—clear in the final lullaby. Causality is lyrical but intact; every ritual beat (fortune, spices, shadow-sister) tightens toward the fusion. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s moonlit permanence is not backdrop but engine: the river of forgetting, starfruit bruising bare feet, blossoms burning without consumption—all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge the bond or lose her forever—intensifies with each ritual step. Agency is continuous; the narrator’s decision to inhale the shadow-sister narrows options irreversibly. Cost is visible: flesh hollows, feathers bud, individuality burns. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: metamorphosis as mutual surrender, love as furnace and forge. The fortune’s re-inscription at the roots reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the branded lip, the shared heartbeat—never in exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, its cadence modulating with ritual intensity. Compression (“reluctant metamorphosis is still metamorphosis”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every scent and flame is filtered through the narrator’s body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent and purposeful. No loops, no scaffold. Rhythm accelerates during the fusion beat without muddle. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) stays within the lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The phoenix-sister fusion, the spice-ritual, and the permanent-moon orchard synthesize into a singular mythic vision. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final backward lullaby feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
