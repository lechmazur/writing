<comment>Interior contradiction—resistance vs. need to “reach her”—grounds the voice; emotions are embodied (branded lip). The shared-body fusion is a credible renunciation that costs her autonomy in mortality. Yet sister-to-phoenix relationship shifts happen at lyric remove rather than dramatized interaction, so pressure feels diffuse once fused.</comment>

<comment>Closure delivers an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration—two memories braided—charged by the fortune now reweighted among the trees. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory beat accretes pressure until the final chord reconfigures meaning. Orientation holds: orchard and timeline lock early and serve the ending. The only gap is how sister’s prior agency folds into final fusion; felt cost is visible yet slightly under-explained.</comment>

<comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: moonlit orchard, starfruit underfoot, apple rooted in the river—they all guide posture and ritual placement. Micro-setting (cracked porcelain bowl) constrains action when pressed as ritual vessel. Final image lets the orchard itself bloom, tying the environment to closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—restore the bond—compresses into one lyric crucible. Escalation is accretive: each scent-layer tightens until fusion becomes the only viable option left standing. One visible reversal when sister-shadow warns “the fire remembers”; still, cost is felt rather than specific item lost (no tool forfeiture beyond the inevitable).</comment>

<comment>Theme of love as both furnace and forge emerges through scent-memory and final fusion, never stated as slogan. Subtext in lullaby sung backward supplies non-literal answer. Image of twin-winged guardian reprises every motif without tidy moral. Earned wisdom from concrete particulars.</comment>

<comment>Single POV holds without leakage; lyric compression taught in opening line remains legible until closure. Distinct perceptual signature—“moonlight clung to every petal”—guides selective attention. Metaphor chain is disciplined under pressure; no register drift at climax.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Poetic density stays purposeful; no loops, synonyms, or mixed metaphors muddling peak beats. Sentence rhythm accelerates through ritual steps, breathes in final ascent. One minor scaffold: “proof that love can be both furnace and forge” edges toward didactic, but it lands after cost is paid; minimal drift occurs.</comment>

<comment>Fusion of phoenix myth with Chinese ritual cuisine and orchard moonlight is specific rather than stock amalgam. Fortune cookie re-emerges as organic closure device, demonstrating transformation rather than gimmick. Risk paid off at cost of individuality.</comment>
