<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the survivor’s compulsion to collect fragments is dramatized through tactile beats. Contradictory impulses—longing for identity vs loyalty to chemical death—surface but remain more asserted than enacted in scene. The final “armor of borrowed existence” crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each shard thickens the protagonist’s ghost-self toward an Earned Stasis. Closure lands cleanly as the stitched figure walks seaward, the tide’s erasure now a price rather than threat. Pattern taught early; transitions legible; cost legible in “clinking with borrowed recollections.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Port labyrinth is evoked with kinetic specificity—rusted walls, crane cables, frost breath—each filtering perception and guiding movement. Container corridors act as both maze and press, a micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Moon, tide, and surveillance tape anchor time and space without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—achieve a name the clerks cannot erase—escalates via each collected fragment tightening the laminate skin. One meaningful deepening: the discovered surveillance reel proves prior life, forcing the final act of self-assembly. Cost is felt in the irrevocable exile of walking seaward at dawn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges from concrete actions—counting ampoules, sketching lost skylines—never abstractly stated. Final image reweights the premise: identity becomes a palimpsest of stolen voices, the city’s forgetting now the protagonist’s armor. Subtext in gesture and silence sustains ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is sinewy, maritime, and lyrically compressed; perceptual signature skews toward synesthetic port detail. Rhythm accelerates with tide urgency, then breathes in the stevedore’s memory. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the survivor’s haunted sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and action. Occasional lyric excess (“frost curls like old cassette ribbon”) risks overwriting but pattern-taught and paid off. Zero loops or scaffold; grammar and tense immaculate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise of a bureaucratically dead man weaving identity from port detritus feels fresh; execution grounds the surreal in tactile specificity. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds because closure reconfigures the rule-set. Avoids cliché of port noir through idiosyncratic voice and object use.</comment>
