<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s survivor status and motive (“collect fragments…prove she had once been real”) stay coherent; her micro-choice to glue recording scraps to steel charges final image. Interiority avoids diagnostic speak, her tactile relationship with the death-certificate-to-paper feeding ritual shows cost. Yet her arc lands more as stoic endurance than a contradiction-tested shift; the “cost” feels conceptual rather than embodied inside her skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the dispersal of the death certificate and the stamped “Here remembered…” container reweights the port’s memory apparatus. Causality (“every seventh tide expands…erasing names”) justifies the inversion tactic. Minor drag in archivist reveal feels contrived rather than motivated, docking 0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>comment>The container labyrinth, moonlit fog, and briny acoustics act as tactile constraint—climbing tower levels literalizes time Mara can’t reclaim; micro-setting constrains the archive placement at tier six. Few details risk becoming atmospheric wallpaper, yet no cap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>comment>Dominant stake (erased identities) escalates via poison label and memory theft stories; each scavenged fragment tightens options until only inverted documentation remains viable. One clear trade-off: feeding personal death-certificate to tide for collective reclamation closes prior path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment>comment>“Who gets to be archived” emerges purely through images: labeled chemical, emptied photo frames, sound recorder. Final non-literal answer—“rhythm of tides pulsed with layered stories”—reconfigures memory without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</comment>comment>Third-person omniscient keeps distance aligned with “nameless identity”; syntax breathes from tidal hush to drone-garbled sensors. Near-perfect control during drone-sensor evasion, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</comment>comment>High information density—“layer of lives that had slipped through official nets,” “dyres sour scent”—with natural cadence. Two over-figurative bursts (“moons that bled yellow halos,” “skin rise beneath her skin like braille”) slightly muddle at climax; −0.3 keeps cap away.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</comment>comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic erasure reframed through maritime soundscape and archived scraps. Poison-label-as-template trick feels inevitable, grounded in container ecology. Final inversion risks echo but executes without cliché.</comment>
