<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya’s contradictory impulses—protecting her mother’s memory vs. publishing the truth—are dramatized in the lagoon’s bargain; the final choice to broadcast the diaries is earned by the visible cost of “years rearrange inside me.” Interiority is concrete, embodied, and stakes escalate with each offered future. Minor slip: the betrayal revelation is delivered via page rather than dramatized interaction, slightly muting the relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every lagoon response is triggered by Mireya’s offered future, tightening toward the decisive act of reading aloud. Closure is a Decisive Change—truth released, path foreclosed—paid for by “years rearrange inside me” and the irreversible broadcast. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. One of the strongest 600-word closures I’ve seen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is not mere backdrop; its retrocognitive rules constrain every tactic and charge the final image when Mireya’s voice becomes “kerosene onto a ready flame.” Micro-setting (canvas cradle, hot glass-grain) and the floating library’s loudhailer are tactile tools that enable the climax. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. personal shame—is signaled in line 1 and escalates with each traded future. The lagoon’s bargain is a clear tightening that forecloses secrecy; the cost is visceral (“throat full of salt”). Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues. One minor dip: external antagonist (Council) remains abstract, slightly softening pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the bargain: memory as encryption, truth as combustion. The lagoon’s final stillness and the sunset pages reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—shell-grammar, kelp spiral—never exposition. Final image of “burnt ink” offers resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through archivist’s taxonomic eye. Compression (“liquid night under day”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; interior texture coherent under stress. Minor rhythmic over-reliance on compound adjectives in mid-section, not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“pages…floating up like dark petals” echoes “dark mirror”) is purposeful motif reinforcement, not artifact. Zero scaffolding; every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes memory-magic, floating archive, and post-Repression politics into an inevitable whole. The lagoon’s encryption mechanic is fresh and fully committed; no retreat to generic fantasy. Specificity of strike schedules and love letters grounds the speculative frame. Risky structure—bargain with sentient water—pays off with crystallized closure.</comment>
