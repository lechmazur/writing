<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya’s contradictory fear of loss and hunger for truth collide inside every shell arrangement and page surrender; the bodily dread when “ink-poisoning” is offered shows stakes rooted in character. Betrayal-by-mother arrives late yet reframes all prior micro-choices. Final refusal to bury shame earns prior causality but would benefit from one beat showing earlier resistance crystallizing under visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain clear: lagoon lure → memory ransom → price offer → decryption → broadcast. Closure lands Charged Poise: she chooses open reckoning with “sunset turned every page the color of burnt ink” and inevitable judgment tomorrow—cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lagoon’s surface, sand temperature, and drifting debris constrain every tactical move—where Mireya plants feet, how far red twine unspools, when sound carries upward. Ziggurat dune and cannon-fire in capital build coherent world without over-exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—truth vs erasure—announced early and escalates through each page-price paid. Lagoon tightens leverage by taking literal years off lifespan, producing visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-archive and betrayal-as-survival emerges organically; the mother’s love-letter contradiction complicates any simple verdict. Final image refuses tidy moral, forces listeners to confront inherited complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lush, deliberate cadence of “liquid night under day,” “ink-poisoning,” “sunset…burnt ink” feels consistent with Mireya’s meticulous archivist consciousness. Sensory selection (hot glass grains under bare ankles) filters through professional lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphor density serves heightened moment—no mixed vehicles or synonym churn. High information compression keeps momentum through “dune-sheet parted like a sigh” and “pages…dark petals” without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating library + retrocognitive obsidian lagoon re-skins post-revolution archive thriller while keeping emotional core: personal record versus state amnesia. Inevitable in hindsight, feels singular.</comment>
