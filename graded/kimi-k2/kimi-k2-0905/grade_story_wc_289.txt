<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulse—writing others’ longing while erasing her own—drives every beat; the spiral and bronze throat crystallize her renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, embodied (“second pulse”), and the final stance shift is earned by prior causality. Minor drift: the elderly woman and monks serve more as mirrors than crucible, so relationship pressure stays light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s whispered confession reconfigures her future authorship and releases communal secrets as music; cost is felt in the “palimpsest” heart. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mirrored line and bell-note layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Transitions between temple, alcove, and pontoon are legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lotus temple, lily pond, and mirrored labyrinth are selectively detailed and constrain choice: the floating pontoon limits movement, the bronze throat demands a spoken truth. Micro-setting (spiral inside throat) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased; weather and glass light evolve with action. Spatial choreography remains coherent across shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—owning versus lending her voice—tightens when the mirrored labyrinth forces public exposure of private lines. Escalation is accumulative: each reflection and bell-note raises the cost of continued ghostwriting. Agency is renunciation; the final whisper forecloses anonymity with felt price. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: authorship as communion versus erasure. Subtext lives in gesture (woman touching paper boat, keeper’s paused broom). Final image—spiral in bronze throat—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers: whose longing now fills the bells?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature (“prismatic quiet,” “green coins minted by storm”) is character-bound. Patterned elision (no quotation marks for whisper) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Mira. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold; no register drift. Final line braids scent and silence into a resonant cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghostwriter of love letters reclaims her own voice via public art—is fresh and specific. Transformation test: story collapses without Mira’s exact occupation and the spiral offering. Risky lyric structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
