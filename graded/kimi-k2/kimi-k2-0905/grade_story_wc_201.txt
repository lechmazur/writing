<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is embodied in the spasm-memory loops; the “mathematics of mercy” want collides with bodily cost. Micro-choice—tearing the strap—earns a visible wound and forecloses return. Slight over-articulation of the math metaphor keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the strap’s cooling trash-glow reweights absolution as asymptotic approximation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; each beat thickens the ultraviolet ledger until the final dimming. Cost is legible in the moss-offering and 1-step map. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Forest’s ultraviolet sap and humming leaves constrain every step and finally absorb the strap’s guilt-photons. Micro-setting (ribcage-as-trunk) doubles as pressure tool. One notch off 9 only because spatial choreography is implied rather than tracked beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how close can mercy get to zero suffering—tightens via each equation scratched into bark or retinas. Protagonist’s agency drives the escalation: each brace, count, and release narrows the asymptote. Visible cost: glowing strap relinquished, skin bruised by sap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between exact math and unreachable absolution; the final image of cooling trash refuses tidy moral. Subtext lives in proprioceptive echoes and ultraviolet bruises. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is proprioceptively skewed: verbs like “echoed inside my joints,” synesthetic “tasted copper” keep the lens consistent. Compression and elision are taught early (“anesthesia’s last gift”) and paid off. Rhythm modulates with stress; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sentences do triple duty: sensory, thematic, propulsion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“cathedral of invisible fire”) flirt with excess but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; pronouns and spatial cues stay clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>“Ultraviolet penance” as embodied forensic sacrament is fresh; the asymptotic mercy equation is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if any core element is swapped.</comment>
