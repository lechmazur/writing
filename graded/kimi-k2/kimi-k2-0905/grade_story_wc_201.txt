<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied, but the protagonist’s “mathematics of mercy” quest is stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation of the mask strap earns its cost yet feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the strap’s release and the forest’s forgetting reweight the premise with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each equation and bruise-colored print tightens the spiral toward surrender.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ultraviolet forest is rendered with selective, sensory precision; the “invisible fire” and “bruise-colored fingerprints” anchor the body-as-setting motif and charge the final image when the strap is laid on the moss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—finding the curve where pain bends into forgiveness—escalates through each equation scratched into bark; the asymptotic mercy tightens the noose of choice until the protagonist’s surrender forecloses the path of endless calculation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of asymptotic mercy emerges from the iterative equations and the forest’s indifferent hum; the final image of the cooled strap as “any other piece of trash” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet lucid; the patterned elision of verbs (“I braced… I tore… I placed”) teaches its cadence early and pays off in the hushed final beat. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“slug of metal that had grown into my skin like a wedding ring made of scars”) risk overwriting yet serve the fevered tone. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph breathes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of forensic sci-fi penance with sacramental ritual feels fresh; the ultraviolet wavelength as literalized guilt and the forest as polygraph create a singular, unforgettable texture. Risky conceit fully commits and coheres.</comment>
