<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical interiority is embodied and contradictory; her shift from refusal to participatory listening is earned through tactile micro-choices and the cost of losing her mother’s rational refuge. The moment she “chose to listen instead of refute” crystallizes a credible, costly stance change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s renunciation of proof for participation is legible, costly, and held under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The tile’s lift and the whales’ answering bass note reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower, tile, and whale-breath micro-settings constrain choices and charge the final image; the astrolabe and tide pool are handled in tactile, choice-altering ways. Salt, jasmine, and reed-raft memories integrate setting into interiority without static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grief vs. connection—tightens when the tile forces participation; the midnight whale-song escalation narrows options and exacts the cost of surrendering rational armor. Agency remains with Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete shift from solitary proof to shared memory; the unheard symphony motif reweights from metaphor to participatory reality without moralizing. The final image of the notebook raised to the whales offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters stars, salt, and whale breath through a skeptical scientist’s lexicon. Patterned elision (“numbers that crawled”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free; figurative language is selective and coherent. Each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes, culminating in the final chord image without overwriting or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of astrolabe, whale migration, and entangled memory feels inevitable and fresh; the magic-square-as-keel-stone reconfigures time-travel tropes into an intimate grief ritual. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
