<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical reflex collides with the tile’s demand to “feel, connect, remember,” producing a visible, embodied shift from refusal to participatory listening; the moment she rights the telescope and steadies her breath is a micro-choice that costs her the safety of detachment and forecloses the purely rational path she arrived with. Interiority stays concrete—salt on lips, whale-breath as bass note—never drifting into label-speak. The arc lands in Earned Stasis: she keeps the notebook, releases the tile, and walks on with “a pulse not entirely her own,” a tenderness whose price is the surrender of her mother’s solitary grief model. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parchment of tide-scored musical notation becomes a Charged Poise that reweights every prior seam she refused to believe was magic. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each star alignment softens the tower walls until the final image of her raised notebook vibrates with the chord she paid for with her former identity. The cost is legible in the “new hollow space…echoing with shared centuries,” a persistent constraint that shapes her next steps southward. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5 and the pattern of memory-invasion is taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower functions as micro-setting: its brass rail, astrolabe, and lens are not backdrop but tools that constrain how she can engage the tile; the moment starlight hits the square the walls literally become porous, admitting salt and jasmine from someone else’s garden. Whale song and tide supply a living metronome that times her midnight stroke and final sunrise gesture. Spatial choreography is immaculate—telescope rings stone, tile lifts a hairsbreadth, notebook is raised into sun-strike—each object state tracked across moves. Environment charges the final image: the calf’s breach against “parchment” sky reuses the earlier paper metaphor, now reconfigured by her shared-score sacrifice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove grief can be solved by reason alone”—is signaled in paragraph 9 and immediately tested by the tile’s demand for visceral participation. Escalation is an Accumulative deepening: each star alignment admits more foreign memory until the only remaining option is to write the unheard symphony, forfeiting academic transcription for communal score. The whales’ bass-note answer is not coincidence but confirmation that costs her the last shelter of skepticism. Price is visible: she releases the tile, keeps the notebook now filled with “night water broken by flukes,” a forfeiture that forecloses the old analytical path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between solitary grief and communal memory; no character states it aloud. The magic square’s migration from ivory artifact to tide-washed keel stone reweights “navigation” from sky-chart to time-chart, letting the final image of walking “with a pulse not entirely her own” answer the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—raising the notebook like a conductor’s baton—turning private mourning into shared orchestration. The unheard symphony motif accumulates meaning each time it appears, culminating in a chord that is felt in marrow, not explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: she traces seams “she refused to believe were magic,” hears whale exhalations “like drumbeats,” tastes salt she never summoned. Syntax lengthens and breathes during memory surges, then compresses into single-clause beats—“She righted the instrument.” No head-hopping; the borrowed memories arrive as sensory intrusions, not omniscient exposition. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors whale-stride rhythm, proving voice modulation serves emotional pressure. Distinctive diction—“keel stone,” “hollow space echoing”—is irreplaceably hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet buoyant: “the sky poured silver over the black ocean” fuses color and motion in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Mixed metaphors are avoided—starlight “freezes” numbers, then “loosens like fog,” both consistent with temperature and evaporation logic. One hairline slip: “tide pool” appears only in the final paragraph without prior spatial anchor, a micro-orientation blink that keeps this just under 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of astrolabe astronomy, Sufi magic square, and whale song as musical notation feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. The tile-as-keel-stone reconfigures both navigation and grief, a fresh inflection grown from Mara’s specific refusal to believe. Risk—letting memories overwrite her—pays off in a closure image that could not exist without that gamble. If names and places were swapped, the entire emotional arc would collapse, proving transformation.</comment>
