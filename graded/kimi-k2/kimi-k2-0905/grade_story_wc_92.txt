<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garnet’s contradictory obedience-to-rebellion arc is embodied in tactile micro-choices (thumb on quill, graphite coaxing pins). The cradle-of-sparks metaphor externalizes her internal conflict and drives every beat. Final mask-drop crystallizes earned stasis with visible cost: identity and career foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → Garnet’s breach → generator seed → chain-room bleed → barges freed. Closure is a decisive change (fort unlocked in every sense) with felt cost (Garnet’s exile implied by mask drop). No orientation drift; transitions legible under single-scene default.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Luminous fort’s iron gate, murdered torch bracket, and copper coils function as micro-settings that constrain tactics (keyhole, breaker, valves). Bruised-violet sky and blackout pressure choices; final sunrise reweights prior dark. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silent revolution—tightens when blackout turns from obstacle to ally. Each beat (quill bridge, valve bleed, timer set) raises cost: Garnet’s identity, Luce’s exposure, Voss’s authority. Final slackening of chains is earned, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaiming agency from institutional ink emerges through concrete objects (quill, graphite, sundial). Final whispered line “we write tomorrow with light” reweights prior darkness without moralizing. Subtext in silent exchanges and mask-drop carries resonant aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Garnet’s perceptual signature: “cradle of sparks inside her chest,” “cool iron of the postern gate.” Syntax tightens under pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“winking hush”). Voice coherent across lyric cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “moonlight slid across its gnomon,” “star caught in a jar.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors blackout hush then accelerating gears. Final sunrise image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: lock-picking graphite, half-painted sundial as cipher, cradle-of-sparks as revolutionary metaphor. Steampunk-fort setting avoids cliché through tactile specificity. Risky blackout-as-ally inversion pays off. Transformation test passed: story fails without these exact elements.</comment>
