<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—her need to notice vs. her fear of erasure—remains embodied throughout. The final choice to leave the needle-less compass charges the renunciation with felt cost: by sanctifying absence instead of mending it she forecloses the comforting closure the reader hoped for. Embodied micro-choices (pressing orris to sill, scattering the trifles) tighten motive with action rather than exposition. Only minor slip: the phrase “because they are, if someone remembers” dips toward explanatory thesis where the image had already answered.</comment>

<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first beat: layered absences build density until the final reconfiguration crystallizes stakes. Every shard and scent cue gains weight and returns in the compass ritual. Closure via Earned Stasis is legible and charged: the houses exhale because Elara chooses rest over repair. The only drag is the paragraph summarizing what the village will “speak of in autumn,” but its placement after closure prevents causality break.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bay cottages, orris dust, and toy compass function as micro-setting with causal bite: scent opens windows, compass center anchors the ritual. Sensory detail is POV-filtered and selective; no generic travelogue. Streetlights as daytime daydreamers strain credibility for literalist readers but function under the textural frame. Final image (“each house stood a fraction straighter”) enacts environment as aftermath of choice.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—homes slipping into living absence—tightens from opening through exhale of restored rhythm. Agency is subtle (collecting, returning, sanctifying) but each step narrows the remaining path. Cost is the perpetual occupation: Elara will carry hush forever. Escalation risks sameness via repetition of “noticing drift,” yet the shift from detection to ritual sacrifice provides one meaningful deepening.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges obliquely—absence is a presence capable of care. The shard of hush never moralizes; instead it charges every concrete object with felt vacancy. Final covenant image resists tidy moral: peace arrives through continued alertness rather than possession. Subtext’s quietness risks drifting toward precious abstraction, but final gesture (raised hand, dark nodding streetlights) grounds it with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical diction (salt-cedar blood, violet flare) remains character-bound. Compression “streetlights daydreamed” teaches the lens early and holds. POV slides into visionary clarity during the doubled interior without unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm modulates from elongated sentence-creeks to clipped “compass stilled” exactly where tension evaporates. No dialogue occurs, so nothing to penalize.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Near-flawless line-level craft: no redundant phrasing or mixed metaphors. Density is high—“a loose bouquet of insignificance that felt, inadvertently profound, like assembling a confession from pronouns” does three jobs at once. Micro loops and passive constructions are avoided in peak beats. The sole near-slipped register “they drank the scent” is still bodily active. Earned 9-band without artifacts at closure.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mosaic of house-as-character is familiar, yet the transformation of trivial cast-offs into liturgically potent fragments feels fresh and inevitable. The shard of hush is not merely metaphor but plot engine that reweights physics of absence. No famous lines are echoed; diction and conceit remain singular. Minor risk: “houses remember louder than the people” flirts with aphorism, but context recontextualizes it as street-light code rather than authorial bumper sticker.</comment>
