<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireille’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to intervene vs. merely notice) play out in micro-choices like pressing the orris shard or displacing her shoe. The final renunciation—leaving without possession—earns its cost through prior ritual and felt disappointment in the chairs. Minor slip: “inadvertently profound” flirts with label-speak yet is dramatized by the objects’ choreography.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cottage’s borrowed heartbeat stabilizes, Mireille’s covenant is sealed with the orris sliver, and the streetlights wake—cost is the irreversible shift from observer to midwife of sentient architecture. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each displacement tightens the pattern until the final vacuum-seal hush. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by dew-cooled cobbles within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bay, cottage, and orris shard function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: the gate latch warms under touch, the carpet becomes a sea for the paper boat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—violet dust, attic cedar, ironed-linen air—each detail charged by the final covenant. One hairline slip: “vanished birthdays” is evocative but abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the cottage’s loneliness—escalates through tactile displacement rituals; the tightening occurs when Mireille offers motion the house can mimic, foreclosing her observer stance. Cost is the cottage’s disappointed thud in her wrists and the irreversible covenant. Agency drives every beat; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between noticing and caretaking; the final image of the cottage folding its hands reframes earlier “inadvertently profound” clues into a quiet ethics of hospitality. No moralizing—resonance arises from the paper boat touching marble and the violet ghost on her tongue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mireille’s synesthetic gift (“tasted of ironed linen and vanished birthdays”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths in dawn description, clipped pulses during ritual. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers image, motion, and consequence. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no filler stacks. High information density: “walls breathing easier, no longer gasping” compresses outcome and cost in five words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sentient architecture as lonely choreographer, not haunted trope. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure reweights premise. Specificity of pension-slip boat and orris covenant makes the concept irreplicable.</comment>
