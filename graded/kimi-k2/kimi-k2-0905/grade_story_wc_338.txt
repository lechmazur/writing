<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s methodical curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—threading film, aligning horizons, pressing palm to parchment—each tightening her stance toward silence. Interiority is precise and character-specific; her mentor’s axiom is recalled only when the map pulses, grounding reflection in present stimulus. The final renunciation—mapping with room for mystery—costs her the mastery she once sought and is earned by the empathic silence she endures inside the henge. One slip: the phrase “shielded openness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the map reknits and the path to the cove appears, reweighting the premise from conquest to listening. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each archival frame, footstep, and spiral’s glow layers density until the silence crystallizes choice. The torn map’s pulse and the parchment’s re-knitting are on-page images of cost. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, lightning-scarred pine, and basalt henge are rendered with selective sensory economy; each constrains movement or perception. The vault’s salt-ghosted saints echo the henge’s sound-drinking spirals, charging the final image of “shielded openness.” Spatial choreography is flawless—films aligned by horizon, map edge fitted between stones. Environment actively guides Elara’s micro-choices and the empathic reconfiguration at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elara map the unknown or allow it silence?—is signaled by the torn parchment and tightens when the henge appears. Agency is exercised in her decision to wait inside the circle without demand, renouncing mastery. The cost is the empathic silence she absorbs, audible as a “second heartbeat.” One meaningful deepening suffices; no escalation beyond the single crystallizing moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between cartographic mastery and empathic listening; no explicit moralizing. The whispered chapel motif returns in the final image as “echo…curled behind her sternum,” reweighting the premise. Subtext lives in gesture—palm to parchment, spirals drinking sound—rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: maps that leave room for mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature—selective attention to cartographic detail, salt-ghosted saints, fox-fire spirals. Syntax mirrors her methodical mind: precise, rhythmic, never ornamental. No dialogue; voice coherence is maintained through interior texture. Compression (“Minutes dilated into a single, slow heartbeat”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, lyrical, and propulsive; every image advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is disciplined—“rain hissed…tiny hammer,” “spirals that drank sound”—never crowding the beat. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final line’s cadence crystallizes the empathic reconfiguration without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of archival film, cartography, and ancient henge feels fresh and inevitable. The henge’s conditional visibility—appearing only to those ready to listen—transforms a familiar trope through Elara’s specific vocation and empathic arc. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Specificity of the lightning-scarred pine as living benchmark anchors the fantastical in verifiable detail.</comment>
