<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tutor’s interiority is rich—thumb in the stone’s dent, translating silence into chess notation—but the “final student who mattered more” never appears on stage, so the decisive change lacks an embodied cost. His contradictory impulses (guilt vs. vocation) are present yet resolve too smoothly into hopeful certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: exile transposed into a larger game, cost felt in the “hopeful melancholy” that lingers like an afterglow. Causal chain holds—teaching → betrayal → exile → nexus insight—though the external action is minimal. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is evoked through bodily sensation—“iron in his blood,” compasses spin—charging the final image. Twilight’s purple shimmer and crystallized air mirror the tutor’s shift from despair to possibility. Environment constrains: the nexus is the only place silence can be “correlated.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to redeem a life ruined by teaching truth—is signaled early and tightens when he realizes the “window to act” before the next phase. Escalation is internal, driven by electromagnetic pattern recognition; cost is the exile itself, but the price feels retrospective rather than presently paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty discovered in difficulty reframes from chessboard to life. The eclipsed covenant becomes both literal political betrayal and metaphor for hidden resources in hopeless positions. Final smile reweights prior guilt without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“algebraic notation into living strategy”—with controlled psychic distance. Syntax lengthens under contemplative pressure, then compresses at the turn. No dialogue, so no register clash; the tutor’s perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors (crystalline geometries, magnetic whispers) serve the concept. Occasional stacked modifiers (“hopeful melancholy lingered like the afterglow…”) flirt with overwriting yet stay tethered to the tutor’s sensibility. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chess pedagogy, geomagnetic anomaly, and political exile feels fresh; the “correlating silence” conceit is non-obvious and fully committed. Risky lyricism pays off in the final reconfiguration rather than gimmickry.</comment>
