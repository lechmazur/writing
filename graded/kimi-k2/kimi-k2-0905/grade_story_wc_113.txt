<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Musician’s liminal identity is vivid and embodied; interiority is specific and consistent. Ghost remains symbolic rather than a second character, so relationship crucible is N/A. Final acceptance of “between-spaces” identity is earned through micro-choices and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: musician embraces disruptive music, foreclosing conventional success. Causal chain (ghost → program → chamber → sheet music) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in final image of dawn performance outside norms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Flooded opera house constrains every move; water level, lantern flicker, and submerged props actively shape tactics. Micro-setting (floating program, hidden staircase) charges closure. Sensory hierarchy filters through musician’s professional ear for altered acoustics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to accept ghost’s disruptive gift—tightens once via descent into archive. Escalation is Accumulative: each water-damaged page increases density of meaning and narrows options. Final choice carries visible cost of permanent outsider status.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art lives in disruption and liminal spaces. Subtext carried by water-damaged images and wordless exchange. Final image of “symphony of the unsung” offers resonant, non-moralizing answer to thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through musician’s auditory bias. Syntax modulates with rising water tension. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than overwriting. Minor loop risk in “between-spaces” phrasing but offset by purposeful repetition. No artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: flooded opera house as acoustic crucible for liminal art. Ghost story subverted into collaborative creation rather than revenge. Specificity of water-damaged program as evolving text feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
