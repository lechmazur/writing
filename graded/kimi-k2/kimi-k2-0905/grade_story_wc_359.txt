<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell ringer’s synesthetic perception and micro-choices (touching the amber sheet, reading glyphs with her skin, striking through aurora) are embodied and character-specific. Interiority remains coherent, and the final renunciation—never ringing another bell—carries felt cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the simultaneous strike fuses valley and cavern, unfettering wonder with visible auroral fireflies nesting in snowflakes. Causality is tight: sculptor’s chisel → bedrock sigh → bell strike. Cost is legible in the cracked, luminous bell and her lifelong silence thereafter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern, lantern rainbows, frozen lake, and aurora under ice are vivid, selective, and constrain every move. Spatial choreography is clean; the cavern’s walls refract light and guide the precise wrist angle. Environment charges the final image when compressed wonder rushes outward.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—certify wonder as essential—tightens to a razor moment: strike exactly with the marble’s first wound. Pressure escalates through auroral glyphs and the narrowing heartbeat countdown. Agency is absolute; cost is the cracked bell and lifelong renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: wonder must be wrested from utility and ornament by precise, sacrificial timing. Subtext lives in silence traded between bell ringer and sculptor. Final image—earth humming aurora colors—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, yet precise: “tasted winter mint,” “green-gold veil that hung between moments.” Rhythm accelerates with the bowstring heartbeat. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and charged at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. Metaphors are coherent (cathedral of frozen chords). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated. Final cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synesthesia, auroral mechanics, and exact-timing bell ringing feels fresh and inevitable. Premise transforms familiar “moment of wonder” trope into rigorous ritual. Specificity—fossilized amber sheet, prism-shaped mallet—anchors the concept. Risk-taking (lyric causality) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
