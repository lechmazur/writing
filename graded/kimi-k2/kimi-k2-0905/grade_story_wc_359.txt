<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid via embodied synesthesia and choice-driven micro-actions; late emergence of Olesia as ghost-memory risks stock mentor shorthand. Renunciation of safety scales to the length but cost is felt rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern tightens as aurora strips each protective “scale.” Closure earns Earned Stasis—“ready to testify”—with visible social cost of outlaw status. Occasional synesthetic tableaux drift toward decorative, minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Select sensory economy—ice as piano, silence sculpted to sphere—grounds spatial stakes. Clear anchors early; final release of aurora re-energizes sky, charging closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake declared early (“certify wonder”). Tightens once: aurora test strips illusions, sheet ingestion seals choice. No external antagonist, but internal resistance and societal peril escalate sufficiently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as infrastructural necessity emerges organically from cavern actions and Olesia’s echo. Final image of bells “quiet but eyes blazing” provides resonant reconfiguration without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic lyricism maintained; synesthetic phrasing mostly disciplined. Slight register lift into declarative aphorism (“wonder… infrastructure”) grates once but doesn’t break immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Vivid density—“breath crystallized into brief golden chords”—balances purple risk. One mixed metaphor slip (“amber fossilized sunrise”) subtracts marginally; otherwise clarity and propulsion intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Synesthesia-as-navigation and acoustic-amber sheet are fresh syntheses. Familiar mentor-ghost trope is refreshed by grand-piano ice shape. Specificity of world rules and synesthetic lens resists swap test.</comment>
