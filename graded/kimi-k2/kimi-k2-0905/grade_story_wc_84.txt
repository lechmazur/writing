<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory pull between detached observation (drone pilot) and viscerally needed reunion is embodied in the spiral-stair descent; the final act of tucking the star-map “close to her heart” forecloses return to anonymity with undeniable, specific cost. Interiority remains concrete—fingers on tablet, stone against ankles—even at the climax, and her surprise is shown via embodied tremor, not glossed label. The pilgrim’s “perpetually surprised” eyes act as consistent environmental echo rather than interior, keeping Mara’s POV strict. Only slight reserve: the parents’ vanishing is narrated rather than dramatized, but that information tilts choices on the page mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure hinges on a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: pulling the press lever reconfigures Mara's world from “chasing” to “answering,” its cost legible in the on-page image “stars spilled…calling.” Causality under Situational/Accumulative hybrid is taught in rhythm rather than linear trace and lands cleanly. Anchor (who/where/when) is locked by line 5; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s sandstone skin, drone perch on colonnade, and press’s iron frame operate as micro-setting; each constrains bodily choice (Mara must squat, ascend, pull). Dusk light itself becomes a tool: time pressure narrows to the single inkable twilight. Final constraint: press bed must fit both matrix and paper, forcing decisive single-pull action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—“will she hear the ‘frequency of belonging’?”—tightens through the concrete choice to pull the lever at the press. Cost is visible in the irrevocable star-map, which forecloses remaining aloft as unattached observer. No reversal is needed; pressure crystallizes in stance rather than external obstacle escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resonance-as-identity emerges implicitly from star-shadows dancing on stones and the final line “frequency of belonging.” Subtext operates silently in the pilgrim’s surprise, the drone cameras’ inability to hear, and the wordless press, avoiding explicit articulation. Closure image reweights the search as home-coming without moralizing sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice carries a tactile specificity—“fingers dancing,” “worn brass,” “cold iron groan”—and modulates under pressure: drone-borne detachment narrows to raw physicality during the print. Only two characters speak; speech patterns remain simple, weighted by subtext, never explanatory. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored in Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Language remains dense without loops; each phrase (“weathered curves holding centuries of secrets,” “star-shadows”) fuses image with pressure. Metaphor of star-map “hitting her like music” is precisely tuned to closure. Only occasional minor filter (“she recognized”) does not muddy the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combining ancient press mechanics with cosmic, micro-etched star-map marries antiquity with speculative resonance; neither trope is left generic. Specific fresh turn: printing frequencies as audible personal truth. The transformation survives name-place swap test: remove press → entire closure collapses.</comment>
