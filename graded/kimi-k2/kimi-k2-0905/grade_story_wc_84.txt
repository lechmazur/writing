<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her racing heart, the drone’s camera-eye, the folded star-map at her chest—but the pilgrim remains a cipher; his “perpetually surprised eyes” label rather than reveal. The decisive pull of the lever is earned by her lifelong search, yet the cost feels light: she gains belonging without visible loss. Secondary pressure from the pilgrim is present but diffuse; he guides rather than opposes. Overall, a strong single-POV arc with minor depth gaps in the relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the printed star-map reconfigures Mara’s reality, and the cost is the irrevocable shift from seeker to finder. Causal linkage holds—grandmother’s dying words → three-week drone pursuit → press lever → frequency recognition. Orientation is swift: dusk observatory, sandstone walls, broken astrolabe all anchored within 120 words. One minor slip: the pilgrim’s exit feels slightly teleporting, but it does not break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s sandstone, broken astrolabe, and dying light are tactile constraints: the astrolabe’s shadow guides the pilgrim’s placement of the press, the amber glow times the matrix chip’s activation. Micro-setting—the iron hand press and brass chip—function as setting-objects that literally print destiny. Spatial choreography is clean; drone, column, and spiral stairs track without drift. Environment charges the final image: the first stars through the broken dome become waypoints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find where you belong”—tightens when the matrix chip’s stars sing her name, foreclosing further wandering. Pressure escalates via the pilgrim’s invitation to pull the lever; agency crystallizes in that single action. Cost is conceptual: the safety of endless seeking ends. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict between curiosity and fear of finality drives the beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-as-frequency emerges from concrete events: drone trails, star-maps, and the press’s groan. Subtext lives in gesture—the pilgrim’s trembling unwrap, Mara’s silent fold—never in exposition. Final image of stars as “waypoints on a journey she’d been making since before she was born” reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is honored: belonging is both homecoming and irrevocable exile from searching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Mara’s sensorium: visor glare, tablet taps, heart race. Distinct perceptual signature—her pilot’s habit of framing the world in camera angles—persists under pressure. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s interior is only guessed at, consistent with POV modesty. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional crests: longer cadence for awe, clipped fragments during lever pull.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, vivid, propulsive; “stars spilled across its surface—not printed, but moving” does triple sensory work. Occasional lyrical lift (“caught the dying light, casting star-shadows”) never stalls momentum. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. One near-purple phrase—“brilliant dimness”—is taught early and paid off, so it reads as pattern, not excess.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of drone tech, antique letterpress, and cosmic cartography feels fresh yet inevitable. Trope of “missing parents” is transformed into a literal frequency quest. Specificity—microscopic constellations that match no earthly sky—grounds the fantastical. Risky quiet ending earns its resonance: no reunion scene, only star-map and lifted drone.</comment>
