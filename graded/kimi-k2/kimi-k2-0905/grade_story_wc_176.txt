<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the moment the rope lifts—“tears freezing into lenses that cracked when I smiled”—showing simultaneous grief and release; the caster’s shift from guilt to carrier is embodied and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope’s weightlessness and auroral flare reconfigure preservation from bronze bell to moving air; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, cost legible in the dissolving card.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum, aurora skylight, and hemp rope constrain every motion; the frozen braids’ shift from rigid to supple directly enables the final circuit, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve names before glacier erasure—tightens once: the rope’s hum and voice-braid force the realization that preservation is ongoing vibration, not artifact; cost is the card’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation as transmission emerges through the rope’s reconfiguration and the card’s dissolution; final image of “spring rivers learn them by heart” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—technical yet lyrical, e.g., “technically gentle wish”—and remains stable; auroral light and organ syntax filter through the caster’s perceptual signature without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“petrified incense and the coppery ghost of old blood” does triple work; rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the white auroral flare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lost-wax casting meets auroral rope-astronomy; the punched card as phoneme-score is non-obvious yet inevitable; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
