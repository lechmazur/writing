<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The protagonist’s interior contradictions (ex-caster of death-bells seeking to preserve vanished voices) drive every micro-choice; the moment he warps hemp back to life shows embodied craft-guilt turning into service, not redemption confession. Earned Stasis arrives when he recognizes that preservation is ongoing vibration “never owned, only carried”—cost legible in the thaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single-scene Accumulative design: lullaby card → rope circuit → auroral flare → glacier wind carries the names. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the remembered names shift medium from fragile paper to moving air, cost visibly paid as the card dissolves beneath the ice before the speaker even walks away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum under pulsing aurora constrains every tactile decision (fingers can’t feel metal, hemp frozen rigid), then re-weights the final image when dawn snowmelt becomes the literal conduit that carries the voices south.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving names from erasure—escalates when rope fibres drink the card’s pattern, forcing the speaker to trade one fragile archive (paper) for an ever-shifting one (wind on meltwater). On-page cost is the card’s disappearance and the permanent absence of any future “replay”—a tightening of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bronze-bells-for-death vs hemp-rope-for-memory; preservation as ongoing circulation, not ownership. Final image—names carried in spring rivers toward the forgotten sea—embeds the abstract concept into concrete hydrology without any articulation of “what it means.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Deeply individualized lyric voice: the caster’s embodied vocabulary (“resonant skin,” “brass ghost of old blood,” “hoarfrost forgiveness”) fuses grief and metal-craft into perception that stays coherent under pressure; no head-hopping, POV distance consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is pristine: high-density lines do multiple jobs; figuratives never obfuscate; varied rhythm mirrors auroral pulses and heartbeats. Zero loops or templates; images crystallized by action: “tears freezing into delicate lenses that cracked when I smiled.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bell-casting craft, punched-card transcription, and glacier acoustics feels fresh and inevitable. The only echo risk is familiar “aurora as soul-screen,” but it’s grounded in rope-astronomer legend and earns its place.</comment>
