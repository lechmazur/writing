<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the mailman’s “respectfully rebellious” stance is dramatized in every micro-choice. Motivation—forcing broken promises to bleed—escalates credibly to the final act of viral memory. The single cost (risking capture by releasing the storm) is felt on the page. Minor slip: Sal’s interiority is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the rain and darkened arcade crystallize the cost while the memory-virus begins its unseen work. Causal chain—bottle as diversion, feather as payload—holds cleanly. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. One micro-transition (arcade to alley) is legible and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cobalt arcade’s solder-scent, cracked cabinets, and flickering neon saints are filtered through the POV’s tactical attention. The bottle, pinball machine, and rain on glass all constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating anchors. Weather is not mere backdrop—it triggers the drones and cloaks the escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—holding the council accountable—tightens when the letter becomes a viral indictment. Escalation is driven by the mailman’s agency: uncorking the storm, planting the bottle, slipping the envelope. Each move narrows options and raises the price of capture. The final downpour is earned pressure, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of absences turned weapon; no explicit thesis is stated. The blue heron feather and bottled storm reweight each other at closure, offering a non-literal answer to “where broken promises heal.” Subtext lives in Sal’s brittle hush and the arcade’s self-darkened cabinets. Moral complexity remains: sabotage is both justice and further betrayal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is noir-tinged yet compressed, with rhythmic control (“hot solder and colder regrets”). Perceptual signature is sharp: the mailman notices electromagnetic noise, ozone tang, chalk scuffs. No head-hopping; Sal’s interiority is implied through gesture. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, tactical, and thematic work. Metaphors are precise (“cumulonimbus claws scratching to escape”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed vehicles. Minor over-writing in “neon saints…crying for every village” is earned by emotional pressure and closure context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cyber-noir and mythic imagery (bottled storm, heron feather) feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The arcade-as-border-zone is a fresh angle on surveillance fiction. Risk is taken with lyric compression and accumulative stakes, yet clarity and causality remain intact. Transformation test: story collapses if elements are swapped.</comment>
