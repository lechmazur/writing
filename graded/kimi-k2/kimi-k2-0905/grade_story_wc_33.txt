<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Riven’s grief-driven vocation is vivid and embodied, the torn patch, vibrating bottle, dry envelope all charged props. Internal contradiction (loyal mailman vs smuggler) stays visible and shapes the decisive surrender of the storm. Final renunciation—returning the weather in exchange for one returned letter—reads as earned stasis with personal cost. Yet the arc leans on summary memory more than on-page relationship friction with a second character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story lands a resonant reconfiguration: the unmarked gate opens when Riven gives back the storm, re-wiring the drone border into a temporary truce. Causal chain from bottle-drop to drone rain holds—“single drop…short-circuit”—every move tightening options until the mailbox re-closes. A visible conceptual cost is paid on-page (he trades away the storm and the chance to read other letters), satisfying closure gates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Cobalt arcade at twilight” and ozone-scented tunnel function as concrete micro-settings; slot positions, cabinets, drone silhouette all constrain movement. The welded mailbox, lightning bolt key, rain-fused stamps integrate with final image to gate the truce. Overly lyrical noun strings (“neon veins,” “dying stars”) slightly blur spatial choreography but never break orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is legible early: Riven must choose between contraband love and safe neutrality. Escalation tightens once when the storm is poured, the game voice speaks, then again when he decides to trade weather for one envelope—narrative cost is the relinquished potential. Stake remains singular (“where broken promises heal”); no reversal but a deepening crystallization under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The promise-equals-dissidence theme emerges organically through contraband envelopes, forbidden weather, and the final soft rain writing “temporary truces across the border.” No overt didacticism; theme crystallizes in the mailboxes “filled with the soft clack of envelopes” instead of commentary. Subtext operates in the quiet transfer key↔rain↔letter without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Consistently lyrical third-person limited, perceptually biased to Riven’s arc-light view (“every absence he had ever fostered pressed against his ribs”). Pattern-taught elision (“shouldering the now-light bottle”) reads purposeful and is resolved at closure. Register stays inside plausible lexicon of a haunted courier; no head-hopping or filter-verb drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical without becoming over-scaffold; near-duplicate stems (“cobalt arcade,” “dying stars”) appear but are spaced and pattern-taught. Some noun-phrase density in opening could be trimmed, yet imagery (“violet against the glass”) stays vivid and specific. No mixed metaphors muddy the decisive rain moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Takes the cyber-noir smuggler-in-dystopia trope and distills it to intimate, family-reunion stakes; the thunderstorm bottle feels novel yet inevitable. The drone-as-censor and promise-vending arcade are original syntheses rather than ornament. Riskiest element—trading weather for words—pays off, making abstraction feel tactile.</comment>
