<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s contradictory impulses—desire to record versus fear of exhausting the world—play out in embodied micro-choices (kneeling, tearing the page). The final renunciation of a forgery carries visible cost, but the interiority occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction that blurs motive granularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ash-snow of counterfeit decades fertilizes real growth, reweighting the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each texture re-enters as living bark—while causality remains intact. Cost is legible in the snapped copper and extinguished lamp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bonsai labyrinth and fluorescent lamp function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the rearranging trees force a new path, the lamp’s hum dictates tempo. Sensory specificity (moss luminescence, copper wire snap) is selective and purposeful, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collecting textures without depleting the world—tightens when the labyrinth begins to grow Aurelia’s forgeries into reality. One decisive intensification: her notepad shifts from recording to dictating, narrowing options. Cost is felt in the lamp’s dimming and the irreversible growth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: history as bonsai, pruned by desire. The final ash-snow reconfigures prior forgeries into living matter, offering a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through rustles, hums, and silence rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—stationer’s attention to texture, ink, paper—remains consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences under wonder, clipped fragments under fear. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Aurelia’s embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“ash drifting down to fertilize counterfeit decades”). Rhythm accelerates during transformation, then breathes at closure. No line-level artifacts touch the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: forgery-as-botany, history-as-bonsai feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (trees growing full-sized in heartbeats) is grounded in tactile specificity and pays off in conceptual reweighting. No close echoes; the voice and premise cohere as singular artistic stance.</comment>
