<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to memory while forging new form—are embodied in every tactile micro-choice; the carving’s progression externalizes her refusal to blink first, culminating in an earned renunciation that costs her the illusion of containment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the finished carving and hung latch crystallize a before/after shift from cage-as-prison to memory-as-key; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each shavings-jar beat tightening the emotional vise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft and ash blank function as micro-setting that constrains every move; storm-light on wood and steam ghosting the loft charge the final image, while spatial anchors remain precise and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing loss without being devoured—tightens through each chisel stroke; the visible cost is the rust-hued shavings that once soaked blood, foreclosing the option to forget.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between cage and key; the final whispered commands reweight the premise without moralizing, letting the lion’s closed eyes and the empty ring below offer ambiguous resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Mara’s perceptual signature—calloused thumb, scarlet ribbons, sawdust memory; no head-hopping, and the rhythmic compression under pressure is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“rust-hued peace,” “steam ghosting”—each image advances story or atmosphere; figurative language is disciplined, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Familiar widow-grief trope is transformed through the specific circus lexicon and the inversion of cage-as-memory; the risk of lyric accumulation pays off in a charged final image that feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
