<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—intellectual detachment vs. filial hunger—are dramatized in the micro-choice to open the diary; the final renunciation of judgment carries visible cost in the unlit candle she leaves behind. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. The “lattice of love” realization is earned because the diary’s wagers sequentially expose her own blind bet. Flaw: we get only one embodied tremor; more bodily leakage under fluorescent library light would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern refracted into spectrum re-weights every prior scrawl, cost felt in the unlit candle she gifts forward. Causal chain holds—scrawls → diary → spectrum → city loop—each because/therefore tightening options. Mosaic of shards is taught by 25% (subway, library, subway) and transitions remain legible. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rain-washed stone and clover-mildew air are filtered through Mira’s probability nose, guiding her to the basement; the cracked mica pane literally refracts the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory hierarchy—wet paper over visual—mirrors her narrowing attention. Spatial choreography clean: lantern on lap → floor → returns desk. Minor missed beat: no tactile temp shift when she exits at dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand without forgiving”—tightens when diary forces her to see her own refusal to see; the final ride to the end of the line and back physically forecloses escape. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost legible in the pages she irreversibly disperses. Coincidence (finding matching scrawls for weeks) complicates rather than resolves. Pressure coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the wager motif: love as a bet against odds, paid in visibility rather than cash. Subtext lives in the unlit candle—an un-gamble passed forward. Final image reweights “bet on the thing you refuse to see” from paternal command to self-wager, avoiding moralizing. Resists tidy forgiveness; instead offers charged poise between mourning and motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature skews to scent and statistical metaphor (“odds were never in my favor”). Rhythm accelerates into staccato subway beats after long library breath. No head-hop; diction stays within Mira’s collegiate lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density: “rainwashed library at midsummer smelled of wet stone and old paper” does triple duty—time, place, POV filter. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to mimic pulse. Figurative language sparse and precise; no mixed metaphors. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” echo in commentary, not text—so no deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle: uses gambling lexicon to reframe grief work as a wager on visibility. Diary-as-field-guide flips self-help trope into recursive parental riddle. City-traversal as stochastic algorithm feels novel yet inevitable. Risk taken in lyric mosaic pays off in closure image. Could edge higher if clover motif were more than atmospheric.</comment>
