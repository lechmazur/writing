<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s interiority is sparse but embodied—raw-knuckled hands, pulse-warmed seat—yet the decisive renunciation (tucking the sphere beneath his tongue) is earned by the palimpsest promise and the girl’s instruction. The shift from ferryman to solitary bearer is legible and costly, though the girl’s motives remain opaque.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sphere distills thirty years into a syllable, the river becomes meadow, and the coach dissolves. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final reconfiguration reweights all prior crossings with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fog-bound crossing is not backdrop but active constraint: it mirrors sky, erases the coach, and births the sandbar. Micro-setting (the yarn needle, the ticking gutters) constrains choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—distill complexity into essence—tightens when the gutters fall silent and the thread siphons color. The coachman’s agency (threading the needle, walking the plank) drives the decisive intensification; the cost is the erasure of his life’s work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the palimpsest promise and the sphere: every story is a ferry, every ferry a thread, every thread a dissolution. The final meadow offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing—only the quiet place where words begin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“spindrift serenity,” “heron’s bone”—with rhythmic control that breathes with pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays coachman-bound, and elision (“memories percolate”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no purple drift. High density: “yarn unspooling, until the rain gutters stopped ticking” compresses action, setting, and stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ferryman as palimpsest, girl as promise embodied, river as mutable parchment. Risk-taking (lyric dissolution of physical world) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
