<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman’s interiority is rendered through embodied, atmospheric memory rather than label-speak; the final act of swallowing the sphere crystallizes a lifetime of crossings into a single, irreversible choice with felt cost. The girl remains functional but thin—more oracle than person—so relationship pressure is minimal. Still, his contradictory impulses (duty vs. release) play out in the walk across invisible planks, and the renunciation is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sphere under the tongue reweights every prior ferrying into one syllable of salt and stone, cost legible in the erased river. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases until grayscale drains the world, one tightening suffices. Orientation is taught early through fog and ticking gutters, waived at payoff. No causality breaks; the palimpsest promise motivates every step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fog, river, and yarn needle function as micro-setting that constrains footing and perception; the invisible ferry-plank is a tactile, lived-in navigation tool. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound (gutters) and touch (thread tautness) under crisis. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from coach to sandbar to meadow. The final meadow reflects sky only, a charged reconfiguration of the crossing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distill complexity into essence before silence—signals early and tightens once when gutters stop. Agency resides in the coachman’s decision to thread the needle with his own memories, foreclosing the ferrying life. Cost is the grayscale drain and the sphere’s lifetime weight. Coincidence (sandbar appearing) is not resolver but recognition of promise kept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the palimpsest image: every crossing overwritten until only one glowing line remains, reframed by the final droplet. No moralizing; the sphere’s pulse under the tongue offers non-literal resonance. Ambiguity lingers—whose promise, whose crossing—without confusion. Thematic weight grows from specific particulars (yarn, varnish, gutters) rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; compression (“reins slack in his raw-knuckled hands”) teaches the pattern early. Diction stays within the coachman’s mythic yet working-class lexicon. No head-hopping; the girl’s interior is never ventriloquized. Final cadence—“quiet place where words begin”—earns its lift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops. Figurative language is dense but patterned (palimpsest, spindrift, metronome) and pays off in the grayscale sphere. One mixed metaphor—“yarn needle thin as a heron’s bone”—is minor. Information density high; each line advances image or stakes. No scaffold or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ferry-to-nowhere trope is transmuted through the palimpsest seat and yarn-needle compass, making the crossing internal. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Specificity of “rain gutters ticking like a metronome” anchors the surreal. The final image—meadow reflecting only sky—feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
