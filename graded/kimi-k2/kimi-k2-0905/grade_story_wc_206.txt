<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the confession to the rust is specific and costly. The daughter remains off-stage, yet her absence drives the final choice with felt weight. Motivation intensifies cleanly from personal to civic stakes. No contradictions or therapy-speak intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is immediate. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky cracks and the city’s palette returns, paid for by Elias’s public honesty. Causal chain (chip → confession → chord → dawn) is tight and irreversible. No teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber and orrery are rendered through Elias’s tool-centric perception; copper, rust, and gear-breath constrain every move. The lantern’s steady flame and the rust-flake “bronze snow” charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the city’s light—tightens when Elias must choose between secrecy and honesty. The single escalation beat (confession to the rust) narrows options and exacts social-emotional cost. Agency drives resolution; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible in the public exposure of his guilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as lubricant for cosmic repair emerges through action, not statement. Subtext resides in the rust’s listening silence and the daughter’s unseen paintings. Final image of the paper bird reframes the cycle without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with a tinker’s perceptual signature—gears, chimes, metal breath. Syntax is precise and rhythmic; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal yet natural when it appears. Voice modulates with pressure, tightening under the rust’s scrutiny.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh (“bronze snow,” “throat for the city”) and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally; no filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses music-box mechanics, alchemical covenant, and stolen dawn in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse if the orrery were any other device. Specificity of the tinker’s craft and the rust covenant creates memorable texture. Risk-taking (honesty as literal lubricant) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
