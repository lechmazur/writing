<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and character-driven but drifts into abstract reflection; his decisive choice to leave clocks ticking at 3:17 ties motive to theme with embodied cost, yet some beats tilt toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causality coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens, ending with a Conceptual Repricing via the frozen watch/compass image. Closure lands; only minor temporal orientation confusion around cellar mechanics dents clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Specificity excels in the greenhouse swirl and frost-bitten Thames cellar, but the waterfall feels ornamental rather than pressing choices. Micro-setting does raise stakes, yet remains secondary to metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—signaled early; pressure tightens when Elias pockets the compass and wades into the pool, paying felt cost. Escalation sustains under the inferred lens with visible constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through motif and character arc rather than assertion; ending reweights prior débris into possibility, but a too-neat moral murmur tempers resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct accumulation-lens prose with rhythmic, slightly elliptical diction; no head-hopping. Voice control holds under symbolic height yet betrays scaffold in metaphor string repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Lovely compression and selective detail, marred by figurative over-stationery near the climax, minor loops, and template-cadence beats that blurt pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms tropes—broken clocks and phantom admirals—into a lyric meditation on time-as-waterfall; specific echo-charge earns cut-cloth risk, but derivative folk-admiral tag feels cautious.</comment>
