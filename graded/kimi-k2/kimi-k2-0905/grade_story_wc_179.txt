<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—pacifist schemer—drives every beat; the shadow-Lira crystallizes her unacknowledged anger, forcing embodied renunciation. Micro-choices (setting the box down, touching the shadow) visibly cost her. Emotional arc from denial to acceptance is embodied, not labeled. Slight abstraction in “cellular memory” risks diagnostic speak but is grounded by tactile detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira relinquishes the music box and accepts her own complicity, foreclosing the path of blame. Causal chain holds—each ghost’s release flows from Lira’s willingness to metabolize her own resentment. Orientation is taught early by the melting/reforming reality, so no penalty. Final image (three silhouettes against a horizon that forgets its beginning) reconfigures meaning with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary’s breathing walls and shifting floor constrain tactics: the space softens only when memory succeeds, turning stone to silk. Micro-setting of the broken music box functions as environment that must be handled, not merely observed. Sensory selection (smell of gunpowder, taste of strawberries) is filtered through POV urgency. Setting charges the final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can resentment be dissolved without force—tightens when the shadow-Lira appears, forcing Lira to pay with her own stored anger. One meaningful deepening: the cost shifts from external persuasion to internal surrender. Agency remains with Lira; coincidence does not resolve. Price is visceral—the cellar crumbles inside her chest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: forgiveness is metabolized carbon, not moral slogan. Subtext in the broken pin’s silence carries the weight of unsung lullabies. Final image reframes the entire premise—peace is willingness to keep turning the damaged wheel. No overt moralizing; resonance is earned through specific memory and loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; “shifting grace” and “cellular memory” are taught by pattern early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences during memory release, fragments under threat. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Lira’s perceptual signature. Distinct diction (“spirit skin,” “carbon that once formed wheat fields”) feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—glass melting, silk walls, carbon fields. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies to mirror breathing sanctuary. Minor risk of overwriting in “forgotten rivers down her chin,” but it serves the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—pacifist weaponizes memory in a reality-shifting sanctuary—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of ghost-soldier and war-child are transformed through embodied memory rather than exorcism. Final renunciation is non-obvious: silence, not song, teaches release. Risky lyric structure holds under pressure.</comment>
