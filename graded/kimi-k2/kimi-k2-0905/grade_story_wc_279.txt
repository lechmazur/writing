<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s need to rediscover meaning after erasing her life’s work is credibly embodied through tactile choices—grinding quartz, sweeping spirals—yet the interior contradiction between ‘meaning as chalk dust’ and the final acceptance could be sharper; the social perceptiveness is shown through ambient insect withholding and grotto etiquette more than in status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure lands with full Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the tile whispers “the mess is the only place unfinished enough to welcome you” and Mira scatters the mandala; accumulated hush converges into a legible before/after shift, the cost is the permanent disappearance of her work and the tile itself; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whispering grotto and lilac mist are not mere backdrop; they constrain her breath, impose silence rules, and yield a ‘pearl’ enclosure that actively shapes the final act; tactile grit of quartz and porcelain snow pin the sensory world underfoot while charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: the need to hear the grotto before the unlearning week ends. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hush folds inward and the tile delivers its singular, binding whisper; Mira’s agency drives the final choice—the sweeping scatter—whose cost is the irreversible loss of both mandala and artefact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Thematic question—how impermanence can cradle meaning—remains implicit throughout and is earned by the vanishing tile, the dissolving chalk spirals, and the final reconfiguration: meaning as motion to repeat. No overt statement is made; the motif of disappearance is paid off rather than recycled.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical compression is taught early (‘mist forgot its own name’) and sustained; perceptual signature stays consistent (color as emotion, silence weight), rhythmic modulation mirrors the hush tightening; no head-hopping or drift in psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose maintains natural rhythm, high density; only minor scaffold with a slight loop on “meaning felt like chalk dust” which is immediately freshened with “present but unformed.” Otherwise strong verbs, precise sensory cues, and zero mixed metaphors.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: the chalk-artist’s medium itself becomes engine of impermanence; emergent hush as a sentient social pressure is novel yet inevitable; every trope (magic tile, vanishing art) is transformed into a non-literal answer to what meaning costs, delivered without gimmickry.</comment>
