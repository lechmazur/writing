<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—yearning for permanence yet erasing her life’s work—drives every micro-choice; the final refusal to keep the mandala crystallizes this tension with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“lilac unease that would tint every future line”) anchors her arc without label-speak. The flaw of compulsive listening becomes the engine of change, not ornament. Earned stasis lands cleanly: she walks away lighter, pockets empty, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mandala’s scattering redefines meaning as motion, not object, with the porcelain snow melt as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added grain and hush layer deepens the stake until the radial storm reconfigures the world. No orientation drift; anchors (grotto, plaza, twilight) are clear by line 3. Pattern taught early (spirals within spirals) pays off in the final sweep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto’s damp stone and lilac mist constrain posture and breath, forcing Mira to kneel and whisper. The tile flake’s porcelain face and the quartz circle act as micro-settings that limit gesture and carry memory. Weather (mist folding into a pearl) directly enables the climactic silence. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → rake → sprinkle → sweep → scatter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with impermanence—tightens as each spiral completes only to be erased. Agency: Mira’s decision to scatter the mandala forecloses the option of keeping any artifact, with the tile’s blanking as visible price. Escalation is accumulative: hush thickens, heartbeat becomes intrusion, lilac unease ripens into acceptance. No coincidence; every intensification is authored by her hand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence and vanishing; no direct statement, only the final image of chalk lines already erasing under shoes. Subtext lives in gesture: sweeping a spiral into a straight path is refusal without speech. The whisper “the mess is the only place unfinished enough to welcome you” reweights the premise without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own chest cavity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “lilac unease drifted with the mist” compresses color, emotion, and motion. Perceptual signature—Mira notices withheld insect songs and chalk dust on her tongue—remains consistent. Rhythm modulates from long, inhaling sentences to the staccato storm of scattering grains. No head-hopping; interiority stays grounded in sensory detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors (“color she could feel on her skin”) are fresh yet physically coherent. High information density: “porcelain snow that melted on the wet stone” does triple duty—image, sound, erasure. No artifacts in the final third; closure image remains crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the ephemeral artist by fusing chalk, memory tile, and emergent hush into a single ritual. The synthesis feels inevitable: only a chalk artist would hear silence as invitation to draw. Specificity—spirals within spirals, lilac unease—creates freshness without quirk. Risky quiet ending lands because the cost is embodied in blank tile and empty pockets.</comment>
