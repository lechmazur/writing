<comment>Zale’s centuries-long insomnia and poetic calling are vividly embodied in his tactile rituals and micro-choices (pressing forehead to limestone, peeling the postcard). The internal contradiction—exhaustion versus compulsion—drives every beat. His final act of sealing the postcard into the shell earns the Earned Stasis: he renounces further sleepless vigil, accepting the cost of ordinary time. The only minor slip is a slightly abstract “smiled in his sleep,” but the prior embodied detail outweighs it.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tower becomes a living shellgram that will continue the watch, reweighting centuries of insomnia into generative bloom. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each dew-bead reflection tightens the pattern until the postcard’s sealing crystallizes the shift. Orientation is immediate (“beneath the gargantuan shell”), and the single spiral ascent forms one coherent scene. The cost—Zale’s surrender of sleeplessness—is legible in the final exhale of petals.</comment>

<comment>The nautilus cathedral is not backdrop but active organ: limestone drinks voice, walls sweat dew, apex chamber becomes womb. Micro-setting (petal, postcard, dew-bead planetarium) constrains every choice. Sensory hierarchy favors salt-taste wind and cool stone over visual catalog. The shell’s bioluminescent throat in the climax directly shapes the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform accumulated pain into beauty before sleeplessness consumes the poet. Pressure escalates through pattern intensification—each dew-bead reflection tightens the spiral until the bloom-armistice must be planted. Agency is renunciation: Zale cedes his sleepless guard to the shell. The cost is explicit: centuries of longing left behind to photosynthesize without him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative act of mailing pain forward until someone can photosynthesize it. The blossom armistice is never moralized; its meaning accrues through concrete images (petal inside shell, postcard sealed into stone). Final image—children planting cherry pits that are “growing armistices”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the mother’s injunction without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is poet-insomniac: synesthetic (“tasted of salt and regret”), recursive, yet precise. Syntax spirals like the staircase, mimicking obsession. Compression is taught early (“three centuries… yet every dusk”) and paid off in the choral echo. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Zale’s perceptual field even in dew-bead visions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers image and motion (“slipping through cracks shaped like ammonites”). Metaphors are coherent—reef-shadow joy, bioluminescent throat—without muddle. No loops or scaffold; redundancy is zero. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating toward the bloom-glow climax. Occasional elevated diction (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) is earned by voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of insomnia, nautilus architecture, and intergenerational postal bloom feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The blossom armistice reimagines pacifism as organic process. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Final reconfiguration—tower as living shellgram—transforms prior motifs into a new organism rather than mere symbol.</comment>
