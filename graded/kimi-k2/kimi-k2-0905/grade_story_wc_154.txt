<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is vivid—cordite-tongued, lotus-hearted—but the morphine haze flattens the contradiction needed at the climax; the boy’s “stay” is felt, yet the narrator’s final lightness arrives more by assertion than by earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each droplet, ink-run, and coral whorl layers until the cast becomes palimpsest; the closure image—coral grooves aligned with plaster spiral—pays off the pattern with conceptual cost visible in the discharge line “handle with tides.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium, banana-leaf drips, and plaster-cast micro-setting constrain every beat; the coral fragment literally charges the final image by resting on the cast, its grooves dictating the spiral that reweights trauma into sediment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translator’s guilt vs. need to unknot children’s confessions—tightens once: the birthday revelation forces him to speak the knots aloud; cost is legible in the “dew instead of blood” shift, though pressure plateaus during lyric exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translation-as-survival emerges through concrete recursion: every smudged glyph, coral whorl, and droplet re-enacts mistranslation; the final image reframes shared guilt into shared sediment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person voice sustains a medicated, oceanic cadence—distant shelling, watercolor grays—without head-hop; compression like “shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent” teaches the reader to read elliptically, paid off in the quiet percussion of the last line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric density stays purposeful: each metaphor (ink as braille, reef as sleeplessness) advances stake or atmosphere; no loops, but occasional modifier stacks (“petal-soft yet root-deep”) flirt with purple without dulling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of medicated battlefield triage with reef ecology feels inevitable; coral-as-memory and plaster-as-confession transform familiar war-trauma tropes into a singular, salt-stung image that could not swap settings without collapse.</comment>
