<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The translator’s interiority is vivid and embodied—tasting cordite, feeling coral ridges—but the moment of “confessing the birthday” is slightly over-articulated, blunting the internal contradiction. The micro-choice to voice the knots is well-motivated and carries cost. Relationship pressure is minimal; the boy is more oracle than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the coral aligned with the spiral reweights shared guilt into shared memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each droplet, smudge, and whisper layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the lighter coral and the ache turned dew.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is not mere backdrop; its droplets echo footsteps and dilute ink, constraining the act of translation itself. The coral fragment serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto wounds—tightens through the act of decrypting the cast. The deepening is driven by the translator’s agency: each voiced symbol narrows options until the spiral and coral fuse. Cost is felt in the sternum’s ache turned dew.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the coral-cast spiral: trauma and translation are co-authored by survivors. The final image of “dew instead of blood” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent” is character-particular. Syntax mirrors morphine drift without losing clarity. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to the translator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image advances texture or stakes. No loops or scaffold. The metaphor “lotus-hearted, petal-soft yet root-deep” risks purple but is earned by embodied cost. Rhythm modulates with the drip-drip of twilight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of coral fragment, child’s cast, and translator’s guilt creates a fresh angle on post-conflict witness literature. The spiral-coral alignment feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
