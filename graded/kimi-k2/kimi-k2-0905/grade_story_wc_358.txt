<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The investigator embodies competence but lacks full interior contradiction; her decisions serve the plot more than a revealed internal fault. No opposing motive surfaces under pressure, and her arc settles at a tidy competence-carrying rather than earned stasis with visible personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is coherent: survey → spiral discovery → escape. Closure delivers Conceptual Repricing (Marcus’s patch and the engine-port) with a felt planetary cost under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clean, scope fits one continuous corridor within word count; no causal leaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Steel labyrinth pulses as both maze and lung, constraining every vector of escape; containers breathe, anemometer spins, patch vibrates. Micro-setting (patch against palm and spiral corridor) ties directly to closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Single escalating stake—prove the engine before it consumes her—tightens to irreversible spiral collapse. Protagonist agency survives by mapping and exit, paying real fear and material cost (flight engineer’s data consumed). Pressure escalates under the pattern/accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges quietly through lived detail: built environments birth unintended consciousness. Patch and spiral act as non-didactic metaphors for human foresight outpaced by its own systems. No final moral states resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Third-person interiority is controlled and consistent; lyrical diction is matched to professional perception without head-hopping. Slight register lift in “singular convergence” is sustained and pays off, so no clarity break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Clean rhythm, vivid verbs; loops are minimal. Occasional figurative overlap (“bruised sky,” “dying afternoon”) reads atmospheric rather than overwritten. High information density in small space, propulsion maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Transforms shipping container port into atmospheric engine—a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Causality feels inevitable after initial premise; image of wind-as-organism lingers.</comment>
