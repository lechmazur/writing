<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—the mortician clings to beauty even as static becomes a map—and embodied emotion grounds her via “teeth chattered against cold starlight.” Yet the moment she decides to dissolve is more rhetorical than rooted: no prior beat lets me trace that step. Still, the self-sacrifice lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterns harvested from corpses swell density until they re-weight the character’s own mortality. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—her body becomes a lattice vessel—earned because each pattern infuses the chip that then dissolves in her. Causality holds without break, time folds but remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Setting is concrete yet fluid—“edge of the skyborne grotto” anchors early, “cloud moss” and “mirror pool fed by aurora” constrain movement and choice. The emerald chip’s micro-setting operates inside her sternum and recharges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, never cluttering causality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled early and narrows when she realizes the spark is her own. A single tightening beat occurs: she presses the chip to her sternum, irrevocably forfeiting her physical self. Agency is internal but decisive; cost is visible in the dispersal rather than escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the particulars—beauty as ferryman against forgetting—rather than any explicit statement. Final reconfiguration (her body turns into auroral lattice) non-verbally re-weights “beauty cannot rescue memory, it becomes memory.” Subtle and earned resonance without a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person single-POV remains taut and lyric; voice is ornamented yet controlled. Compression—“mirrors fracture… aurora pulses overhead”—is pattern-taught and legible. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent throughout, from brittle ice to warm static.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense, information-rich, and propulsive. Some figurative overlap—“fractured reflection… starlight drip… maps across cooling flesh”—edges lush yet the pattern is purposeful. Minor loop: the word “static” thrice in two paragraphs. Still, closure clarity survives unscathed.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Frame—beautician mortician harvesting souls into one emerald chip until she dissolves into aurora—is fresh and organic, not a cliché. Emotional specificity grounds the concept; cultural myth of dragon tear duct is original detail. Final image feels inevitable in hindsight, satisfying transformation test.</comment>
