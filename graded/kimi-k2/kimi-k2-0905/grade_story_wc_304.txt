<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath catch like a held note”), contradictions are present but not dramatized in-scene; the final dispersal is earned and costly, yet the sister/mother backstory is asserted rather than lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist’s self-sacrifice reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost (“she became a lantern… seed new constellations”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, final image reweights premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, mirror pool, and aurora constrain every move; the emerald chip doubles as micro-setting that charges the final dispersal. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—tightens through ritual action; the deepening occurs when she realizes the spark is her own. Cost is felt in her dissolution; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as ferryman emerges organically; final image of dispersal offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture and silence; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“dead skin cells arranged like constellations”). No head-hopping; compression and elision are pattern-taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional figurative layering approaches excess but never muddles cause/effect. Rhythm modulates with pressure; zero loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>“Beautician mortician” and dragon-tear emerald create a fresh synthesis; the skyborne grotto ritual feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
