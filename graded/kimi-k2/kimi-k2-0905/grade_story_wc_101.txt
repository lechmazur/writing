<comment>Mara’s micro-choices (pausing under the arbor, letting the boy glimpse the bell, deciding the ridge spiral must close) are embodied under rising pressure; her desire to protect children collides with looming scarcity, driving two visible trade-offs. The silence-amplified-as-protest trait is dramatized, not declared. Cost is paid in sleep sacrificed and formula smuggled. Minor: Lita and the boy register but never force Mara’s final stance, so relationships stay secondary.</comment>

<comment>One seamless scene held under the drive lens “Accumulative/Textural.” Each beat layers density and stakes: cart wheel noise → bell glimpse → triple runs plan → silent toll. Closure lands as Charged Poise: bell’s unfelt vibration reconfigures the valley’s solidarity without a sound. Exact on-page sentence: “below, shutters opened a finger’s width,” showing cost felt before and after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Arbor and bell act as micro-setting that constrains choice: shattered tiles threaten discovery; bell’s engraving guides the exit route. Wild sage scent threads tension through the final ridge ascent. One sentence – “scent rising like unbanned prayer” – fuses setting with political stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (smuggling hope to displaced children) tightens over one night. Rising price: rice tripling, memory soon rationed. Agency: Mara escalates to “triple the midnight food runs”; final invisible bell toll stakes claim that the next dawn may not include rice. Slight reliance on off-stage sanctions tempers 9.0+.</comment>

<comment>Emerges from silence, inheritance, and clandestine support rather than declaration. Final silent toll reframes all prior parcels as quiet defiance, charging the arbor’s emptiness. One potential anti-gate: “intergenerational support coded as food lists” hints at theme summary, but beats earn the phrase instead of asserting it.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrid, dense prose with controlled compression: “exile taught her that silence could be amplified quiet.” POV remains tight on Mara, no head-hops. Rhythm tightens under climax: single-sentence paragraphs mimic heartbeat when bell emerges. Distinct sensory signatures (lamb’s-wool muffling, terra-cotta glints).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Zero scaffold, high density. Vivid nouns, active verbs: “wheels disguised as ordinary vendor noise” does double work. Metaphors are coherent (silent bell as map) and never blur cause. Final line – “the ridge itself remembered how to sing” – crystallizes cost without overwriting.</comment>

<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: silent bell = covert anthem, formula smuggled in false cart bottom = maternal resistance, ridge spiral = living countdown. All choices stem from the characters’ material constraints; swapping any element disturbs the lattice. Minus 0.2 only for resonance with classic dissident-genesis tales.</comment>
