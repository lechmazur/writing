<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her heart “hammering louder than the bell” after the felt slips—and her micro-choices (melting her exile permit for wax, painting tile numbers on bread) enact a believable hierarchy of values. The endurance she models is internally consistent, yet the final communal reading of Lila’s note is handed to the group rather than forcing Mara to a personal renunciation that costs her a live option; the cost is distributed, not individualized, keeping her arc just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each midnight run adds density until the bell becomes archive and the ridge becomes text. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—knowledge is now literally inside the bell and inside their bodies—felt cost legible in “the bell carried both summons and scripture.” No causality breaks; every beat (saffron ink, bread eating, tile memorization) grows from prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terra-cotta tiles, silver bell, and powdered-milk tin are handled in tactile, lived ways that constrain tactics (tiles as text, bell as archive). Sensory selection narrows under curfew pressure—only the “whisper” of felt on metal, the scent of “blocked harbors.” The ridge’s cracks-as-syllables directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural survival—tightens when donations stop and flour vanishes; Mara’s response (painting tiles on bread, teaching children the route) is active and costly. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from receiving aid to becoming the archive. Cost is visible in the consumed bread and in Mara’s sacrificed permit; escalation stays coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern of ingestion—bread, milk, language—so that “we will echo inside our bones” lands as earned reconfiguration rather than slogan. The anonymous note reweights donations from mercy to investment, a conceptual turn that reframes all prior parcels. No final moralizing; resonance lingers in the bell’s hollow now sealed with memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual filter—“voice pitched to the hush between curfew bells”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors stealth: long sentences for climbs, fragments for danger. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. The lyric pattern is taught early and pays off in the final communal reading.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry double duty—e.g., “she carried both calories and curriculum”—with natural rhythm shifts under pressure. Only one paraphrase loop (“anonymous donations appeared… anonymous donations were not mercy”) but it occurs early and does not recur at closure. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—sanctions-era exile community turning architectural cracks into a living alphabet—is non-obvious and executed with conceptual rigor. Risky choices (eating the map, sealing the chronicle inside a bell) heighten stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; removal of any core element collapses the logic.</comment>
