<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya’s longing is vivid and embodied; her every micro-choice (painting the corridor, stepping into tide) flows from the private ache to reclaim the runaway dream. Interior contradiction is present—hollowed by absence yet willing to trade an unnamed memory—but the emotional cost is stated more than dramatized in body. The final saturation is rendered as luminous abstraction rather than a felt physical price, keeping the arc just shy of full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library now pulses with returned voices, the boat-mobile checks out memories, and Mireya resumes her post with palette sealed in dawn-gold—an Earned Stasis whose cost is the unnamed memory she traded. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each painted stroke and shutter click layers density until the cipher spell completes. The horizon-as-shy-animal conceit is taught early and repaid when the sky’s torn edge becomes the photograph that isn’t on film, so orientation debt is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The coral library, tide-licked basalt, and shell-page ridge are tactile, selective, and filtered through Mireya’s painterly attention; they guide her choices (where to stand, when to greet the ridge) and charge the final image of shelves pulsing with voices. Weather and water behave as cooperative magic yet remain internally consistent. The movable horizon constrains her tactic—she must bargain an unnameable memory—and thus meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recover the runaway dream to restore erased voices—tightens once: each exposure inhales painted light and exhales a cipher letter, thinning the air until the final glyph appears. Agency is hers; the bargain is accepted and paid. Cost is legible in the emptied camera and the memory she can no longer name, though the price could be even more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Longing as both private ache and communal restoration emerges through image rather than thesis: the paper boat of starlight, the library shelving hush now brimming with voices. The final mobile checkout reweights absence into luminous remembrance without moralizing. One hairline slip: “luminous absence now brimming” risks echoing the prompt’s tagline, but the reprise is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly anchored to Mireya’s painterly perception; perceptual signature is distinct—colors released like heat lightning, horizon as torn photograph. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer liquid clauses build toward the decisive snap, then fragment as light implodes. No head-hopping; elisions (“clocks forget their purpose”) are taught in the opening and paid off at closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic load without paraphrase loops. Mixed metaphors are controlled—“neon seaweed,” “cathedral of salt”—and serve the accumulative design. One near-overload in the final third (“airy saturation... gap between heartbeats”) flirts with abstraction but does not dull the closure image, keeping the score sub-9 by a hairline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The whispering library that shelves silence instead of books, the palette ground from sailors’ tears, and the photograph that costs an unnameable memory synthesize into a singular mythic system. Risk-taking—movable horizon, paper-boat dream—heightens stakes without gimmickry and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept commits fully: no retreat into generic fantasy furniture.</comment>
