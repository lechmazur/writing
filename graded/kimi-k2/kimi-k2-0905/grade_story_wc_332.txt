<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mireya’s interior contradiction—hollowed by absence yet fiercely private—drives every beat; the palette’s crack and the camera’s empty film chamber crystallize her cost. Embodied emotion (“airy saturation”) anchors the final renunciation. No status dynamics on page, but single-POV arc is complete and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s coral shelves pulse with coherent longing, voices restored at visible cost of Mireya’s own memory. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each painted color returns through her veins, reweighting the premise. Horizon “movable as a shy animal” taught early; pattern pays off when the photograph transfers directly to shelves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whispering causeway and coral lattice constrain movement and supply the cipher’s conduit; the palette itself becomes micro-setting that cracks under pressure. Sensory selection (salt breath, neon seaweed) filters through Mireya’s painterly bias. Final image of the paper boat mobile charges the library space with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream to restore erased voices—tightens when each exposure thins the air and the palette cracks. One decisive turn: the shutter click that inhales painted light and exhales the final glyph. Cost is legible in the hush now “containing every color she had painted.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of longing as palpable absence emerges through concrete events: lighthouses reshaped into question marks, voices released from books. Final image of patrons checking out the paper boat reweights absence into brimming possibility without moralizing. Subtext carried in gesture—Mireya shelves hush that now “contains” what was lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “tide tongues licked basalt runes,” “heat lightning outlining invisible things.” Compression taught early (“latticework of coral shelves that hummed”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue, but perceptual signature remains painterly, salt-stung, and consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “folded paper boat burning cold fire” does triple work as image, dream, and glyph. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for dawn bleed, staccato for shutter clicks. Zero loops; no mixed metaphors. Final line’s repetition of “whispering” recharges the motif with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: librarian who shelves silence, paints with starlight-salt pigment, and photographs horizons that steal unnamed memories. Transformation test passed—plot collapses if elements swapped. Risky lyric compression succeeds; concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
