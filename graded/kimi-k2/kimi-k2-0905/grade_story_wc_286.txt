<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lin’s calm, tactile interiority stays consistent; her micro-choice to press the leaf and later shape the hive embodies the “phototropic” trait with visible cost (wet clay, unfired risk). No contradictory impulses surface in-scene—she moves from listening to shaping to guiding the child with unbroken serenity—so the arc is more emblematic than conflicted. The ending renunciation (leaving without fire-hardening the hive) is credibly foreshadowed by her kiln wisdom, but the absence of any internal push-back keeps the portrait one-note. Still, within the lyric mode, the characterization sustains the fable’s pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the unfired hive and lantern projection reweight the rule-set—kindness itself becomes the kiln, no flame required. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (smoke, thrum, dew, fruit) layers density until the final overlap reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift—who, where, when signaled by line 3—and the single timeline strand pays off the mosaic of visions. Cost is legible in the hive’s unfired fragility and the tree’s second fruit given away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The apricot tree, cracked hives, and lantern glass operate as micro-setting that directly constrain choice: leaf angle guides Lin, hive slats offer clay memory, glass fractures steer sun patterns. Sensory hierarchy favors taste and touch—ash-honey air, wet clay, sharp fruit—filtered through Lin’s potter bias. Spatial choreography is clean: step-over, kneel, set beneath, lift higher. Environment evolves causally—dew appears after the thrum softens—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to tend kindness so a place can change”—is signaled early and tightened once: the clay hive must stay unfired, a visible price that forecloses kiln safety. Agency is accretive: Lin’s steady pulse, leaf press, hive shaping, lantern alignment—each beat adds density rather than reverses course. No external antagonist is needed; the wasteland’s refusal is the situational pressure. The final note softens but does not resolve, maintaining cost in the hive’s fragility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: unfired clay, unburned smoke, unborn bees—kindness as a non-violent kiln. No character states the moral; the child’s empty jar receives the second fruit, sealing the covenant in action. Ambiguity lingers: the oasis may vanish again, but memory travels forward, reweighting the premise without tidy comfort. The aftertaste of “sharp gentleness” is earned by the fruit’s flavor and the hive’s wet risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly aligned to Lin’s perceptual filter—sun patterns inside her eyes, thrum inside her skull—no head-hop. Syntax is rhythmic, cyclical, mirroring bee wings and kiln glazes; diction stays within a calm, zen-adjacent lexicon. Compression (“time stitched itself”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Voice remains distinct under pressure without drifting into pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Metaphors (smoke flattened, wax ghosts, torn silk) are dense but purposeful, never mixed, and accrue toward the final glaze image. Information density is high—each line advances image or stakes. One minor scaffold: “the thrum deepened, a bee-wing vibration inside her skull, splitting one moment into many” could lose “a bee-wing vibration” without loss, but the rhythm serves the lyric mode and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of beekeeping, kiln craft, and time-slippage feels fresh and inevitable; no trope checklist is visible. The unfired hive as a kiln of mercy is a non-obvious reconfiguration of both craft and kindness. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. If names and places were swapped, the core metaphor would collapse, proving specificity.</comment>
