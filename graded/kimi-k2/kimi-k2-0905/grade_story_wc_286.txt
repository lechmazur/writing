<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lin’s interiority is vivid—embodied pulse against apricot leaf, clay memory—but her decisive act (shaping the unfired hive) arrives more as mystical inevitability than earned contradiction under pressure; the cost is felt yet causally diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the unfired hive hardens without fire, sealing a covenant of kindness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final golden note reweights all timelines. Cost is legible in the vanishing footprints and the child’s empty jar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned oasis is rendered with selective, urgent detail—cracked white hives, apricot leaves angled like cupped palms—each object constraining Lin’s micro-choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why places resist change—tightens through sensory accumulation rather than causal reversals; the single deepening (bees return to wet clay) narrows options and carries visible cost (the unfired hive must hold). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of kindness as living memory emerges organically from Lin’s tactile acts and the tree’s phototropic response; the final image of the child’s jar reframes the entire journey without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“chimney smoke flattened against the copper sky” teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Lin’s throughout. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent (“wax ghosts,” “torn silk”); no loops or scaffold. Final cadence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of potter, beekeeper, and fractured timelines feels inevitable in hindsight. The unfired hive as kiln of mercy is a non-obvious but grounded transformation. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
