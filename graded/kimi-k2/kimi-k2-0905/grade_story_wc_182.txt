<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her whispered synonyms for regret make ink-flowers bloom, embodying contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to trade a year of her life for the unspoken word is earned by prior resourcefulness and carries visible cost. Relationship with the time traveler is a crucible: she risks her lifespan to free him, then accepts his silent nod as payment. No stock phrasing; every beat is filtered through her perceptual signature.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elara pronounces the missing word, losing a year of life and gaining the library’s absences. Causal chain holds—each glossary-step redefines itself because she descends, the diary’s seeds cut the traveler’s sentence, and the root-walls part only after the hybrid bud blooms. Orientation is anchored by the obsidian shelf and the mountain’s pulse within the first 120 words. One continuous descent scene with a single transition at the threshold.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop; its corridors spiral like staff lines, forcing Elara to read her way downward. The botanical diary is a micro-setting whose pages mutate under pressure—ink-flowers open, seeds fall through commas—directly constraining choices. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound: she tastes unheard symphonies and feels moonlight fail. Final image of wind-borne absences drifting toward cities recharges the setting’s living roots.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve forgotten mistakes before they flower into war—is signaled by the brass plate “Return What You Never Taught.” Escalation tightens when each glossary-step crumbles and reassembles, forcing Elara to pay a year of life to open the root-walls. Agency is hers: she folds the page into a compass, crossbreeds extinct pronouns, and speaks the unspeakable word. Cost is unmistakable—one year subtracted from her death and placed into the traveler’s chest.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of stealing absences: civilizations’ unlearned humility is replanted as second thoughts. Subtext operates in scent-spelled words and silent cello chords that haunt future historians. Final image—ink drying into a seed—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: rescue missions never end, they merely change dialects. No moralizing; complexity is embraced as the library already composes new lessons.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “staircase disguised as a glossary,” “comma slicing his wrist.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s—botanical metaphors, synonym-whispers, regret as pollen. No head-hopping; even the traveler’s flicker is filtered through her gaze. Syntax mirrors descent: short, stepping sentences under pressure, then swelling cello cadences at closure.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—pollen-dusted compass, petrified-paper desk—and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates during the rescue, then resolves into the quiet seed-drying line. High information density with no filler.</question>

<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The library of unlearned lessons is a fresh synthesis of Borgesian archive and eco-fantasy, made specific through Adelpha Green’s emotion-mapping seeds. Risk-taking—trading lifespan for a word—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: swap any detail and the emotional calculus collapses. Final hush of cello in historians’ dreams is an inevitable echo of the unheard symphony.</question>
