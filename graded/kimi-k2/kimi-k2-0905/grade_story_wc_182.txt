<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is embodied in concrete micro-choices (folding the page-compass, crushing the verbena), but interior contradiction is thin; the time traveler remains a prop rather than a crucible, so relationship pressure is absent. Motivation sharpens late—stealing absences for the world—yet the cost (one year off her death) is stated more than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library seals, absences drift outward, and the final image reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each lyrical beat layers density until the crescendo—though orientation is briefly disorienting before the pattern is taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is vividly tactile—obsidian shelves, root-walls spelling warnings—and constrains every move; even the diary functions as micro-setting that recharges the final release of absences. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection narrows under urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve unlearned lessons before they seed war—is signaled early and tightened by the linguistic cipher; the hybrid-word cost raises stakes. Agency is clear, but the price (a year of life) is more announced than viscerally felt, keeping escalation just shy of top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ignorance as cultivable seed, rescue as replanting silence. The final image of absences drifting toward cities offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext hums in gesture—the cello note, the synonym for hope—without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet legible; perceptual signature is consistent—Elara tastes symphony, folds regret into paper. Patterned elision (“time hiccuped”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible arcane-linguist lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; metaphors (crystal paragraph, comma slicing wrist) cohere without muddle. Occasional stacked modifiers (“labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain”) flirt with excess yet serve texture. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The library of unlearned lessons, seeded absences, and botanical grammar synthesize into a fresh mythic engine. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure; the concept feels inevitable in hindsight and could not be transplanted unchanged.</comment>
