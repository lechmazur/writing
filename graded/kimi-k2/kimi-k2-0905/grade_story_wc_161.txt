<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirela’s fleeing the smugglers’ ring and her decision to hide the meteorite chip both seed and pay off her internal turn toward trust; her silence while risky feels true to a fugitive still weighing loyalties. Calves “remembering” rooftop leaps is clean embodied emotion rather than label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The meteorite drop-closet for tomorrow’s memory cleanly sets off the attic sequence; Blackwood’s sanctuary offer escalates stakes by turning hiding into alliance, and her final silent release of wings is a perfect causal link to vanishing the archive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The camphor-and-sheet-music attic is weighted by the loft’s skylight, governing visibility and Inkspot’s cadence; space tightens each night she returns until the bright dust-mote chord blooms and withers, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Preserve the echo of lost songs” versus “smugglers’ paper trails” tightens the central choice: erase identity or bear witness; the pigeon loft and covert air-drops incrementally narrow options until Mirela’s release is foreclosed. </comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Preserving lost songs becomes both driving want and symbol of endurance—beauty surviving regime purge—rendered as a non-literal lullaby carried bird-to-bird and echoing in children’s jump-rope rhymes years later, never declared, always embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, visionary lens stays locked in Mirela’s skewed attic observations: oil-drop eyes, apricot Bucharest, dust motes as musical notation. Register never drifts; every descriptor tightened under the threat of constables or dementia.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm pulses in camphor-arpeggios, dust-note cadences, minimal scaffold; high-density image strings (“camphor and yellowed sonatas,” “oil-drop eyes that reflected...”) advance with no loops or near-duplicates, all under skylight pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The archived-lost-songs-as-avian-code premise feels fresh because it is rooted in specific bird-breading and hymnal watermarks—not quirk for its own sake—and ends with city sky quilts humming echoes survivors will hum unaware.</comment>
