<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mirela’s contradictory impulses—flight vs. preservation, guilt vs. hope—are embodied in the meteorite chip and Inkspot; her renunciation of the old identity and final dispersal of the song feel earned by prior micro-choices and visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each shard (arrival, cataloguing, sanctuary, disappearance) layers density until the final image reweights the premise—her absence and the sky-stitched song create a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The attic’s dust-mote swirl and skylight rectangle constrain Mirela’s balancing act and return in the final chord; rejected libretti nests and ration cards ground the world without clutter, all filtered through her fugitive attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve lost songs while evading capture—tightens as constables close in; Mirela’s agency drives the dispersal of the melody, paying the price of permanent exile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as migratory song emerges from the concrete act of encoding lullabies onto birds; the ending’s aerial quilt offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting erasure into communal remembrance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, sensorily precise voice remains anchored in Mirela’s perceptual signature; purposeful compression (“dust motes rose and fell in slow arpeggios”) teaches the pattern and pays off in the final dust chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; no loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with pressure; occasional elevated diction (“feathery envelopes for forged borders”) stays within the narrator’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing courier pigeons, meteorite seed, and attic archive into a fugitive lullaby feels fresh; the synthesis is inevitable in hindsight and the risk of lyric dispersal heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
