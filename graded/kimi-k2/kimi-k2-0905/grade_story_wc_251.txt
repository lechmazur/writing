<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Mara’s trait of “hearing unspoken words” is dramatized via specific chess pieces and real confessions, creating clear interior stakes, yet the final collective renunciation is somewhat generic—felt cost sits in the sapling but is shared across the town rather than singularly embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure delivers a conceptual repricing: the town’s rules reborn through “questions growing like moss.” Causal arc is visible as each staged window visibly leads people to the grotto, and the final image reweights all prior quiet into audible action—no causality break, though the mechanism is lightly magical rather than step-wise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Cobalt mist-library anchors space and mood in tactile detail; the window-displays expand geography without losing spatial legibility; the living sapling constrains Mara’s final gesture and binds to the grotto’s metallic trees, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can losing teach the game?”—escalates as the stakes shift from board to town, each confession tightening vulnerability; collective cost is felt, but escalation is thematic rather than external threat-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through image and act rather than declaration; the reversal of pawns stepping “off boards into sapling shadows” becomes non-literal answer to fixed play. Ambiguity lingers without abstraction drift.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is controlled, distinct, and sustained throughout. Metaphoric layering (“dented tin of chess pieces like contraband,” “magnetic grotto… trembling”) serves internal viewpoint without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm is musical and propulsive; few adjective strings; one minor filter stack: “She spoke the way she coached” (acceptable compression). No closure-muddle artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of chess mythos with town-wide ecological rebellion is fresh; image of “windows like low constellations” recontextualizes familiar quiet-curfew trope with earned visual logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The coach organizes the rebellion; her method (window displays) turns the plan literal, and her trait of hearing pieces directly yields the climax—three gates present, cost attached.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Magnetic grotto introduced early, handled mid-scene (she cradles it), then catalyzes the living tree’s placement—ties past diorama to living forest; closure-linked.</answer>

<question>9 C</question>
<answer>7.2</question>
<comment>Chorus of confessions and window rebellion actualizes the stake, not just theme; the sapling final act embodies “humble rebellion” as town rather than top-down.</question>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.1</question>
<comment>Hears pieces explicitly, leading her to Ellis; later governs confession prompt—cost exacted when truth is spoken aloud—present across beats.</question>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Cradling the living-sapling root is the decisive act that entwines real and miniature trees, charged into final image.</question>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Organizing twenty store-window installations is dramatized step by step; the mechanics lure townsfolk directly, shaping final turnout.</question>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Mara’s nightly refuge and staging ground; magnetic grotto placed on its shelves—site of confession and seed binding—grounds choices.</question>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.9</question>
<comment>“Amplified quiet” becomes shared pulse: first labeled then embodied when 2 a.m. silence transmutes into shared breathing.</question>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Second thought foresting is Ellis’s explicit desire; every confession adds visible sprout—want threaded through every beat.</question>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Tone modulates from sharp hush to choral pulse—quiet is progressively “amplified” into resonant collective breath audible at dawn.</question>
