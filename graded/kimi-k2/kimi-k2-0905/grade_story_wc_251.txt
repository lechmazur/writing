<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heard unspoken words the way other people heard wind”), but the late arrival of Ellis and the crowd dilutes sustained interior pressure; the final renunciation is earned yet feels slightly collective rather than singular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sapling planted in the grotto crystallizes the rebellion with visible cost (“real and false roots entwined”). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, though the synchronized-window montage is more lyrical than driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt library breathes and shifts like a rook; the magnetic grotto’s iron trees physically tug Mara’s compass, constraining her path. Sensory selection is purposeful, but the town’s geography remains lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what if losing is the only way the game learns?”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara renounces fixed games. Cost is felt, yet the external pressure is more atmospheric than antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the refusal to sacrifice pieces; the final image of pawns stepping into sapling shadows offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“stone walls breathing the cold hush”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“forests of second thoughts”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The chess-as-rebellion premise is familiar, yet the magnetic grotto and synchronized window displays transform it into a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Specificity anchors the universals.</comment>
