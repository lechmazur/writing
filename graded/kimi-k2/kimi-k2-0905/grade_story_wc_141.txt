<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “grim knowledge that he was probably wrong” and heartbeat feeding the cello—but the final renunciation feels slightly under-motivated; the compass-pulse choice is more image than earned consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the three sounds blur into one hum, reconfiguring the universal riddle from difference to sameness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each note thickens memory density until the compass crystallizes meaning with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory, cello, and seashell form a micro-setting that constrains every action; broken telescope swinging north and flaking paint charge the final image. Spatial choreography is tight, sensory detail selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the riddle—tightens through each resonant hum; the cost is the surrender of certainty and the audible forgiveness of retold voices. Agency remains with Arlen; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the riddle was never the sounds but the insistence on difference. Final image of porous, unvarnished truth resonates without moralizing, reweighting prior myths and debunks alike.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, maritime diction, and spiral syntax mirror Arlen’s obsessive listening. No head-hopping; perceptual signature (“salt spray,” “star-dust”) stays consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (spirals, tides) without overwriting. Zero loops or scaffold; final cadence breathes exactly where the hum dissolves into silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—every culture buries the same three sounds—is transformed through the cello-as-memory-grave. The synthesis of seashell compass and unfinished instrument feels inevitable and fresh; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
