<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arlen's self-contradiction – myth-buster who plays memory-alive cello – drives the arc; interiority vivid, yet final “gloomy cheerfulness” feels summary; cost is felt via lost seashell and deliberate leave of cello, but interior shift is more stated than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (images and tones accrete to CR closure). Closure on compass-pulse realization lands with conceptual cost (no proof but carried pulse), but final sentence drifts toward summary rather than crystallised image, capping high-band reach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Observatory cliff, broken telescope, cracked plaster constellations constrain posture and frame cello; telescope swings itself provides moment of charged presence, yet setting never narrows physical choice – acts more mood backdrop than tactical cage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Single stake: decode same three buried sounds. Tightening occurs when realization flips from “why identical” to “why audience insists on difference”; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, so lower than high band; agency is attention/refusal, cleanly depicted.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Thematic question reframes perception rather than mystery, earned by musical retellings. Resonant, non-literal answer – listeners create difference – avoids didacticism and is carried by image of drifting hum reassembling listener’s past; nuanced, avoids platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice texture rich with controlled diction: “bruised sky,” “sunburned pigment,” syntax breathes with cello phrases, no head-hop; perceptual ear-to-inner alignment remains tight; minor risk of lyric excess at climax but kept taut under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences do multiple jobs – description-action-metaphor triangulate in single lines, no loop or scaffold, rhythm modulates with cello pulses, high clarity; minor overwriting check in “salt spray: the grim knowledge…” – abstract intensifier – but never clouds cause or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Conceit unique: universal sonic ur-message decoded by myth-buster via literal instrument feeding on memory voices, synthesis of myth archaeology and musical séance; premise feels inevitable; risk distinction bonus for cello-as-resurrection device heightens closure without gimmick.</comment>
