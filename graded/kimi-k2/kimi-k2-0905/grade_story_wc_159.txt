<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is rich and embodied—her foxglove heart closing, the memory of Por’s kiss, the foxglove regret on her tongue—yet her contradictory impulses (preserve names vs. erase self) are stated more than dramatized in real time. The final self-sacrifice is foreshadowed but feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with in-scene. Still, her embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are vivid and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The story teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early and lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s silhouette offered to the chandelier reconfigures the museum’s stakes and charges the final image with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; causality is lyrical rather than linear, but the lens holds. Closure is on-page and legible under the Accumulative/Textural drive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The opal library, glass-orchid petals, fossilized-sigh lectern, and chandelier bulbs are specific, sensory, and purposeful; they constrain choice (petals drink sound, bulbs demand memory) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the marble spiral, mezzanine drawers, and twilight breath are anchored. Environment actively guides tactics and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—signals early and tightens through each memory-for-name trade; the final bulb’s demand for Lira herself is the decisive intensification. Agency is clear: every sacrifice is her choice, with visible cost. Pressure escalates via lyrical accumulation rather than causal reversals, consistent with the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation demands self-erasure, memory’s value is paid for with lived experience. Subtext operates through gesture (forehead to stone, silhouette offered) and charged imagery (foxglove regret). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about the cost of remembering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and internally coherent; syntax and diction (“diaphragms of sky and memory,” “phosphorescent plankton”) reflect Lira’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Compression and elision are pattern-taught and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; figurative language is disciplined and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; final image crystallizes without overwriting. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The glass-orchid caretaker, museum of extinct feelings, and memory-for-name economy synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious fable. Tropes of sacrifice and remembrance are transformed through specific world-logic and embodied cost. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet surprising, with no close echoes.</comment>
