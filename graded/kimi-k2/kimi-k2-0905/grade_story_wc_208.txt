<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maela’s contradictory impulses—yearning to decipher the slide yet yielding to the storm’s violence—play out in embodied micro-choices (wedging the slide, carving with memory). Her final renunciation of GPS is earned by the prior ritual and carries visible cost (loss of certainty). Interiority is specific and sensory; no stock therapy-speak. Flaw: “perpetually learning” is asserted more than dramatized beyond the opening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the miniature archway becomes a charged vessel that reweights all prior alliances. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern shift until the final image crystallizes meaning. Causality holds: each carving cut thickens the shadows, culminating in the fleet’s release. Cost is legible in the dissolved lantern slide and abandoned GPS.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is no postcard; its grooves constrain Maela’s carving path and later absorb the projected fleet. Salt-gray wood, turbine-hum, and moonlit spirals are selective, sensory, and filtered through her sculptor’s attention. The setting evolves: stone ledger → shadow theatre → glowing pocket throat. Micro-setting (driftwood fissure) literally holds the story’s hinge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the slide is gift or geas—tightens when the storm forces a decision. Escalation is textural: each cut increases the shadows’ weight until the archway’s debt is repaid. Agency is active carving, not passive reception; the final release costs the lantern’s physical form. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: every act of making is also an act of remembering, and escape can be arrival. Subtext lives in gesture—shadows kneel before the carved archway without a word of explanation. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: the future is “just horizon, just wood, just the next breath.” Complexity is scaffolded by simplicity, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “turbine-hum reverie,” “salt-gray wood,” “time-woven alliances” feel coined for this narrator alone. Syntax mirrors the storm’s surge and ebb; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful—ellipses taught early (“GPS had failed…”) and paid off in the final refusal. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never opaque: “gears of salt and starlight” compresses mechanism and myth in four words. Rhythm accelerates with lightning, then hushes into the single line of departure. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“geas,” “armature”) is justified by the narrator’s craft lexicon. Closure image is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: driftwood sculptor + magic lantern slide + storm-carved ledger is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The conceit that an archway is a palimpsest of rescues and debts feels newly minted. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—could not swap names or places without collapse.</comment>
