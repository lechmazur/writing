<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s grim optimism is embodied in every micro-choice—counting primes, rolling dice, smearing blood—so motive stays kinetic. Interiority is concrete (“ghost-weight of a hand”) and contradictory (panic vs. resolve). The final refusal to step through the ripple is earned by the entire texture of climbing; cost is the blood-smeared steps that keep turning. Only the “mathematician” backstory is slightly abstract, not dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the staircase forgets her, reweighting the rule-set with the chipped die as key. Causal chain—equation whisper, dice balance, blood sigma—drives the rupture that ends the perpetual motion. Orientation is taught early (“infinite staircase spiraled”), no drift. Cost is the bleeding palm and the staircase’s shiver, both on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The staircase is not backdrop; its perpetual motion constrains every choice and is finally ruptured. Micro-setting of the step itself becomes canvas for blood-sigma, charging the final image. Sensory selection (“velvet-heavy with the texture of almost”) is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean: steps fold like paper, no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightened when the dice balance on the missing corner. One meaningful deepening: the staircase slows, forcing her to choose between stasis and continued climbing. Agency drives the rupture; luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the perpetual climb itself and the blood she pays to keep it moving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive regret equation and the staircase’s refusal to accumulate time. Subtext lives in the chipped die’s asymmetry and the blood-sigma that marks time in a timeless place. Final image—the staircase forgetting her—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif constrains choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is mathematician-poet: “probability was a liar here,” “counting backwards from infinity.” Syntax mirrors the spiral—long sentences for ascent, fragments for rupture. No head-hopping; POV is locked to Elara. Compression (“grim optimism”) is taught early and paid off in the final smile.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise (“heartbeat skipping”) and physically coherent. Density is high: dice clatter, stone shivers, blood smears all in one breath. No overwriting; even the velvet-heavy air is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The infinite staircase as recursive regret engine is a fresh synthesis of Sisyphus and Gödel. The chipped die’s asymmetry becomes a key, transforming a familiar trope. Risk is high—non-linear, lyric, conceptual—but coherence never breaks. Specificity of “sigma symbol she once used to sum infinite series” anchors the abstract in lived detail.</comment>
