<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between public skeptic and private believer is dramatized through her trembling grip on the shell. The final renunciation—color for memory—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by the garden’s chromatic drain. Minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she admitted she wanted…”) mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden becomes public archive, the shell’s circuit completes, and Mara’s grayscale body is the felt price. Causal chain (shell → gate → pond → archive) is tight; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Orientation is anchored within 120 words and the lens (Causal) holds to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The velvet garden’s indigo hedges and foxglove tunnel constrain movement and perception, guiding Mara to the pond mirror. Micro-setting (shell, pond rim) functions as tool and constraint. Sensory detail is selective and urgent; color loss is both literal and symbolic. One minor spatial hiccup—“half swallowed by moonlit wisteria” could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the quarantined memory—is signaled early and escalates through each beat: shell’s whisper, gate’s song, pond’s replay. The tightening choice—singing the lullaby at the cost of color—narrows options and is irreversible. Cost is legible on the page (“twilight had drained to grayscale”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as communal resistance emerges through image and action, never stated. The final white flowers carrying copies of the forbidden lullaby reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the shell’s silence and Mara’s color-blind smile invites reflection on collective ownership of erased pasts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“petals unfolded backwards, stems exhaled chlorophyll mist”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices textures, frequencies, colors filtered through her loss. No head-hopping; POV remains tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is coherent—no mixed metaphors. One paraphrase loop (“memory… memory…”) is minor. High information density without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of state-quarantined memories accessed via resonant garden is fresh yet grounded. Transformation of skeptic into archivist feels inevitable. Specificity of the three-note lullaby and color-for-memory tradeoff makes the concept singular. Risky lyricism pays off in the final communal bloom.</comment>
