<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Naram-bel’s frugality, fear of empirical irony, and devotion to his sister are embodied in concrete micro-choices (bartering barley, whispering her name, pressing the tile to the door). The final renunciation—becoming “the silence between regimes”—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only minor drift: the sister remains off-page, so relationship crucible is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the astronomer’s Earned Stasis—vanishing to guard the chamber—reconfigures the palace’s future and carries undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; every beat links because/therefore. One transition (courtyard to inner sanctum) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Palace breathes through selective, purposeful detail: cedar doors, cracked lapis lions, copper door, starlight clerestory. The magic square tile functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy reflects Naram-bel’s priorities—dust like pale constellations, cool copper under palm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve knowledge before new king erases it. Pressure tightens once—tile’s projection reveals the hidden sanctum—forcing irrevocable choice. Cost is legible: eternal guardianship, vanishing from history. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mathematics as resistance to empire. Encrypted devotion is dramatized, not stated—tile’s lattice translates into dimension, covenant sealed in silence. Final image (dust that refuses to settle) reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in gestures: pressing forehead to tile, whispered name.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomer’s diction (“empirical irony,” “invisible hinges of heaven”) stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadences in dusk, clipped steps inside sanctum. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Compression (“time tasted of copper and ash”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density. Metaphors are precise—dust like pale constellations, equations murmuring in cuneiform. No mixed vehicles. Syntax accelerates under pressure. Final line lands clean: “dust that refused to settle.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magic-square-as-key reimagines Babylonian palace as vault of pure number. Risk-taking (renunciation over confrontation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of tile’s 34-sum and lapis weight makes premise irreplaceable. Transformation test: story fails if names or place change.</comment>
