<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (precision vs. doubt) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—becoming the carrier wave—earns its cost through prior causality and the tactile handling of coins. Minor slip: “stellar doubt” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s self-distillation into static reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each coin’s dissolution tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ambered deck liquefying into sunset actively constrains the final choice; the telescope’s receptor plate functions as micro-setting that charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One minor spatial drift: “amber walls glowed faintly” vs. “deck began to dim” could track cleaner.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wavelength alignment before the final pulse—tightens through each coin’s dissolution. Agency drives escalation; the last quarter’s scream forces the decisive stance crystallization. Cost is legible: her atoms shed memory as price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of turning extinct civilizations’ apologies into signal. The final whispered reversal—“You will remember this forgetting”—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“resinous floor fused from centuries of stardust and sap”). Patterned elision (backwards prophecy as static) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not overwrought. One paraphrase loop (“quiet enthusiasm” twice in close proximity) nicks perfection. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information density, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—universe as collapsed marble, coins as distilled regret—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (“hexagonal piece from Kepler-9b”) grounds the cosmic frame.</comment>
