<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The keeper’s arc hinges on a single, silent decision to transmit love at dawn; interior contradictions remain poetic but lack visceral cost, and reliance on metaphor can verge on abstraction. Earned stasis qualifies, but the shift feels more mythic than psychological.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as charged poise: the mother is reimagined via glass, salt, perfume, and withheld tenderness, crystallizing options in the final garden image. The inferred lens is accumulative-textural; a tightening pulse of light converts the lighthouse itself into a pulsing heart with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Gardenia, tobacco flower, and approaching rain saturate each beat; glass fountain, perfume molecules, and metronomic beacon collectively constrain the keeper’s tactic of soft transmission—absolute proof is impossible with shouting iron alone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Outer objective—guide the first sail back—is shadowed by the inner vow to reach the drowned mother; the single tightening (warmer reaches colder) is sufficient under the lyric lens, yet the sail’s slow turn risks coincidence as navigator.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Thematic resonance crystallizes around inheriting a mother’s frequencies while unlearning mechanical roars; the final image reweights all prior alarms into a tender scream. No moral is declared, only the prismatic cost of soft survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dense, lyrical syntax with patterned elision of commas and fractured clauses mirrors the keeper’s sub-audible listening; filter-verb slippage occurs but is taught early and repaid in the final heartbeat rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush, occasionally purple (“screaming tenderness,” “glass vibrating with memories”) and suffers synonym churn around fragrance verbs; however, the metaphor streamlines to a single, pulsing phrase in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Turning the lighthouse into a crystallizing, glass-vibrated heartbeat feels inevitable yet delightfully non-obvious; mermaid-mother traveling on purified intents offers a fresh synthesis of myth and physics.</comment>
