<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (“articulate unspoken needs”) stays legible, interiority vivid, embodied emotion registers, final choice to release petals earns renunciation cost; however, the echo functions less as a character crucible than a thematic mirror, flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure uses Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): open-mouth/listening-ear glyph plus released press re-weight prior stakes; Causal lens holds (encoding → glyph → storm). Missing orientation cost caps at 7.6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Courtyard, mist, and copper plate constrain posture and tools; final image of empty plate and glowing glyph “listens” as micro-setting closing image—environment charges cost. Vivid specificity, but lack of ground-reference to world-building anchors remains minor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unspoken needs vs. erasure) tightens with each stanza; micro-turn hits when echo warns “You’re encoding us away”; cost encoded into the glyph/petal release. Escalation coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: giving language to silenced longing, cost paid in renunciation of petals. Subtext lives in gestures, glyphs, moth wings—no overt moral. Ending reweights need as shared, not solitary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ballerina-poet syntax is consistent, lyric elision taught early and legible; “driftingly alert” registers selective attention; thunder-hum cadence modulates pressure without drift. Voice remains single-point without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dense, musical prose sustains momentum; no looped phrasings or redundancy. Imagery (“bracts bruised chromas,” “sonar pollen”) runs tight line-level. Clarity high, propulsion strong.</comment>

<comment>Freshens graffiti-as-code trope with storm-capture and flower-press archive. Risky lyric structure rides line between poem and story; payoff earns resonance minus a sliver for echo-could-be-dialogue ambiguity.</comment>
