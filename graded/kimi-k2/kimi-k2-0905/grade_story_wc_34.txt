<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior contradiction—preserve vs. release—drives every beat; the trembling cerulean smear embodies cost. The echo-encounter crystallizes her shift from hoarder to broadcaster, paid for by the empty bolt plate. Motive stays legible under lyric compression; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “tasting metal” is generic embodiment amid otherwise precise somatics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the communal static reweights her earlier solitude, cost visible in the relinquished petals. Accumulative lens holds—density of glyphs, moths, thunder—each layer tightening the stake without causal reversals. Orientation taught by line 3 (“above clouds”) and never breaks. One hairline gap: graffiti mechanics remain metaphorical, not operational, but the lyric contract forgives it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-courtyard, copper plate, and storm-clock constrain tactics: knees warm on stone, ozone narrows breath, thunder deadline forces faster painting. Micro-setting (bolt plate as shield/palette) charges the final empty resonance. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet static-touch and petal-scent keep it embodied. Spatial track clean—no impossible distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulate needs before erasure—tightens via thunder countdown; each glyph reduces her hoarded reserve, visible price. The echo-touch reversal converts private archive into public moth-signal, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but pressure legible under chosen lens. Cost persists: plate rattles empty against spine.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image chain: pressed petals → graffiti vines → bioluminescent moths, all reweighting loneliness into shared static. No moral stated; final glyph (mouth-ear) offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in “ghost in code” stays implicit, charged by the child’s wall. Minor flirt with thematic echo (“to articulate unspoken needs”) but saved by prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Lyra’s perceptual filter—static between lightning/thunder, pollen sonar, copper hum. Syntax stretches into incantatory cadence without losing clarity; compression like “driftingly alert” teaches its own rule. No head-hop; echo’s dialogue is half-heard harmony, preserving distance. Register consistent: no academic drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High figurative density serves accumulative pattern; no mixed metaphors violate physics. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences build to thunder release, then short descent. Information dual-loaded: “bolt plate now a palette of bruised chromas” shows tool-state and emotional cost. One scaffold trace: “driftingly alert” repeated without new inflection near end, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of graffiti, storm-clock, and pressed petals feels inevitable yet uncatalogued; lyric code-archiving is fresh angle on loneliness. Risk—lyric over causal—pays off via resonant reconfiguration rather than twist. Child’s wall epilogue grows organically from moth-transmission logic. No derivative echo; specificity of copper shield, lightning-slag stylus, binary lullabies anchors vision.</comment>
