<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prophet’s interiority is lyrically particular—his belief that “obstacles were only instruments not yet tuned” governs every micro-choice, from striking barrels to swinging at silence. Yet we never feel a contradictory impulse that might fracture his certainty; the absence of internal dissent keeps him just short of full three-dimensional pressure. Still, his embodied listening—pressing ear to wind, copying petal-notations—renders him an individual, not type. The cost is present but diffuse: the raft’s future is staked on his sonic gamble, a price felt more by the community than by his own psyche.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the raft moves under a spiral of its own sound, the silence converted to groove with visible forward motion and communal sweat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layered echo increases density until pattern break (the crown of tubes) reweights the stake. Orientation is taught lyrically—place and time float, but the drift itself becomes the anchor, so no penalty applies. One causality nit: the cyclonic eye arrives as gift, not consequence, slightly diluting the “earned” quotient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating orchard is never static backdrop; peach cambium, salt-soaked roots, and clinking glass buoys all double as percussion that propels the raft. Micro-setting—the parchment glued with petals—literally steers navigation, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is prophet-centric: sound first, then turquoise droplets, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography remains clean even during the communal drum-circle on rails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the Doldrum Wall—surfaces early and tightens when engines fail. The prophet’s dub ritual is the single meaningful escalation that converts stillness into breeze, foreclosing the option of waiting. Cost is legible: the raft must become a speaker, exposing sleepers to endless fractal echoes, a communal fatigue implied but not yet felt. Agency is pure; the cyclone assist is luck, yet it complicates rather than resolves, preserving causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “silence is just untuned potential”—no character articulates it; it accrues through struck absence and spiral clouds. The final image of raft-as-orchestra reweights every prior knock and chime without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: conversion of obstacle may merely trade one fragility for another, a complexity left alive. No motif is token; each sounding object returns transformed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person floats yet clings to the prophet’s perceptual filter—sounds arrive before sights, metaphors stay sonic. Rhythm mimics dub mix: looping clauses, delayed verbs, fractal echoes in syntax. No head-hopping; children’s interiority is implied only through external dance. The elevated diction (“alto cumuli sliding into bass stratus”) is justified by the prophet’s synesthetic vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propulsion high; each image carries dual duty (sound + motion). One paraphrase loop—“fractal generating, each echo birthing a smaller echo”—is deliberate pattern-teaching, not artifact. No mixed metaphors; cloud-lyre and nautilus remain coherent. Final third is clean, allowing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The drifting orchard is fresh, yet the piece’s real invention is sonic navigation: converting silence into wind via communal dub. Risk is high—an entire climax built on swinging at nothing—but payoff lands. Transformation test fails: this exact emotional arc could only exist here. The spiral-crown rigging feels inevitable in hindsight, a synthesis of prior sound imagery.</comment>
