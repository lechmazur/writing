<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prophet’s interiority is embodied in tactile sound-making and micro-choices; his conversion motive intensifies through escalating pressure. No contradictory impulses on the page, yet the final stance crystallizes with visible cost—the raft’s survival becomes his renunciation of silence. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A. Single POV holds clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Doldrum Wall is not defeated but transmuted into instrument, cost paid by collective labor and audible risk. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of layered sound builds until cadence shift propels raft. Orientation anchors within first 120 words; no causality breaks. Final image reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating orchard constrains every tactic—salt-soaked roots limit speed, glass buoys become percussion tools. Micro-setting of copper-mesh cone and bamboo crown directly enables climax. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the final image: raft as vibrating speaker. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—raft must escape Doldrum Wall—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of rhythms increases until silence becomes groove. Agency lies in prophet’s iterative dubbing; cost is sweat, time, and risk of failure. One decisive intensification suffices; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sound converting stillness into motion; no direct statement. Final spiral image reweights prior cloud-reading and fractal pattern without moralizing. Subtext in shared heartbeat drumming braids solitude into chorus. Resonant ambiguity lingers—success feels provisional, earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature rooted in acoustic attention. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences calm, fragments tighten during crisis. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Distinct diction (“cambium and salt-soaked root”) reflects prophet’s craft. Dialogue absent, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“fractal generating, each echo birthing a smaller echo.” Metaphors organic and consistent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates naturally during climax. Line-level artifacts absent; clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Premise of sonic-propelled orchard is fresh synthesis; tropes transformed through grounded acoustic engineering. Spiral nautilus reprise feels inevitable. Specificity of whale-bone mallet and drumfish skin anchors invention. Risk-taking in lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
