<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“borrowed time grated against her ribs”), motives escalate from preservation to self-sacrifice; the final renunciation (remaining as archivist) is earned by the prior surrender of heat. Minor slip: “wild serenity” is asserted more than dramatized in mid-beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the oak doorway reconfigures inheritance from storm to library, cost is the protagonist’s exile from passage. Causal chain (egg → spiral → cap → sapling) holds; only one transition (ice retreat) is cleanly handled. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound atrium, starlight, and the acorn cap function as micro-setting that constrains every move (heat loss, root cracking floor). Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; dome fracture reappears in closure. A hairline generic in “polar night” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve seed-memory vs. chaos—tightens when each seed pressed into soil costs body-heat. One decisive deepening: spiral’s shift from devourer to heartwood narrows options irrevocably. Cost is visceral (her warmth, her exclusion from the doorway).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of inheritance-as-debt emerges through image and action; final line “pay by planting what you cannot bear to lose” reweights prior motifs without sermon. Subtext in spiral’s hunger = unbound time, oak’s order = paid debt. Complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“furiously tranquil hunger”). Syntax mirrors spiral motion; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—temperature as texture, starlight as root-map—holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, almost no scaffolding; each sentence layers image and consequence. Metaphors are coherent (velvet over iron). One minor paraphrase loop (“borrowed time” phrasing) does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate myth and seed-archive feels inevitable; vortex-as-library is fresh synthesis. Specificity of extinct squash and tooth-scarred cap anchors novelty. Risk in lyric entropy-decrease pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
