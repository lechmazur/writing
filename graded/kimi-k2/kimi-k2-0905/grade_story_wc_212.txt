<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but consistent; the acorn cap warmth and pulse choice embody contradictory impulses. The final “circulation” split is earned by the lineage breath and costs her the seeds. No second character on page, so relationship bullets skipped. Voice stays particular to her gardener-perceiver filter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: splitting the bead re-weights time’s rule-set and charges her heartbeat with visible cost. Causal chain holds—sap slows vortex, seeds settle, she walks out hearing borrowed time. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One transition (atrium → snowfield) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains every move; frost retreat geometry and starlight through thinning ice charge the final image. Micro-setting of acorn cap functions as pivot object. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and temperature, filtered through gardener expertise. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as seeds orbit then settle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reopen linear time”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when sap drop slows the vortex, foreclosing preservation or surrender. Cost is the split bead now lodged in her pulse. Agency drives the final circulation choice; coincidence absent. One meaningful deepening satisfies 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of seed-saving as possibility stewardship emerges through action, not statement. Final image of “silk tearing and mending” reweights borrowed time without moralizing. Motif of spiral/vortex recurs with shifting meaning. Ambiguity lingers: she bears time’s cost yet seeds wait anew.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to her perceptual filter; diction of horticulture and cosmology feels character-bound. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for awe, clipped for choice moment. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets skipped. Patterned elision (“furiously tranquil”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, pattern-taught. High information density: frost retreat, seed orbit, pulse split all within three lines. Final silk/mend image is precise, not purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cosmic-egg + seed-saver + entropy reversal synthesizes into fresh mythic climate fable. Risk of abstraction grounded by tactile acorn cap and gardener muscle memory. Transformation test: swap acorn for any other token and the lineage breath fails. Wild serenity tone feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
