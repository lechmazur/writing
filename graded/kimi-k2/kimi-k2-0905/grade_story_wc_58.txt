<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“ink-stained fingers trembling”), motives deepen as the thread’s true nature is revealed, and the final self-recognition is earned by prior causality. Micro-choice of planting the last inch of thread crystallizes her transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the thread’s unmaking reweights absence into presence, cost is legible in the empty notebook and aching joints, and the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first shard to final image without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden’s autumn light and leaf-patterns are filtered through POV bias, constrain her ritual, and charge the final image (“paths spelled words”). Micro-setting of thread in soil functions as charged object that alters later choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform absence into presence—tightens as each inch of thread shortens; pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density increase. Final planting forecloses her role as obituary writer with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: writing deaths for the living is reframed as choosing one’s ending. Final image (“absence became presence”) offers non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through the traveler’s obituary-writer lens. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, free of loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Rhythm modulates with pressure, culminating in the crystalline final sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—obituaries for the living as healing cartography—is fresh and fully committed; transformation test passes. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, yielding inevitable resonance.</comment>
