<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The survivor’s grief-driven compulsion to harvest “unused potential” is embodied and escalating; every micro-choice (smashing breakers, leaping) is rooted in the same wound. Interiority stays concrete and particular—no therapy-speak. The final renunciation (choosing to become the perturbation that redirects the drone) is earned by the prior causal chain and carries visible cost: his life. Flaw: the bride’s late appearance is more symbol than crucible, slightly blunting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the fall reconfigures the telescope’s aim, trading one death for many lives. Causal lens holds—each beat (geode maps → hunt → observatory tilt → dive) links by “therefore.” Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. Minor drift: the phrase “mechanical grief” edges toward abstraction, but the final image reweights the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating observatory’s transparent floor, helium hiss, and cooling circuit breakers are vivid, selective, and tied to action; the desert three miles below is sensed through wind patterns that will later reroute a drone. Micro-setting (geode against telescope) constrains the pivotal choice. One spatial hiccup: “outer railing” appears without prior placement, but the final image still charges the setting as the fall alters the telescope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvesting unlived futures to avert further deaths—is signaled early and tightens once: the realization he’s “death’s accountant” forces the dive. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; each hunt costs geode dust and narrows options. The visible price (loss of self, literal fall) is legible on the page. Slight over-intensity in phrasing (“bleak exhilaration” twice) but pressure never stalls.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief commodified into a resource, the moral cost of turning tragedy into currency. Subtext operates through image (geode dust like wedding cake) rather than statement. The final dive offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer—becoming the unlived potential for others. One near-miss: “death’s accountant” flirts with thesis, but the image of swirling dust as champagne flutes rescues ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and internally coherent; perceptual signature favors fractured light, dust, and star-maps. Compression (“I wasn’t supposed to be here”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the survivor. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short staccato as breakers trip, longer cadence in reflection. One register drift: “perturbation theory” feels briefly academic, but context grounds it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (geode as second heart, futures pooling) stay coherent and concrete. No loops or synonym churn. Minor overwriting: “intangibly tangible” risks tautology, but the phrase is immediately embodied by the weight of unlived lives. Final line lands with clean, earned cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—quantum grief-mining via perturbation theory—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (post-apocalyptic survivor, magical crystal) are transformed through specific physics-inflected grief logic. The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by concrete sensory anchors. No close echoes; the final image of the fall as “someone else’s unfiltered awakening” reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
