<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"geode's hum had pulled me upward"—but the protagonist’s shift from grief to predatory harvest feels slightly under-motivated; the cost of becoming “death’s accountant” is asserted more than dramatized. Still, contradictory impulses (grief vs exploitation) coexist in scene, and the final renunciation lands with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the fall re-aims the drone, trading one death for others. Causal chain holds—each geode fragment spent buys a perturbation—and the final image reconfigures meaning without exposition. Orientation is immediate; lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Observatory and desert are sharply sketched—“helium sacs hissing,” “transparent floor”—and the geode itself functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice. Spatial choreography is flawless; the telescope’s .003-degree shift is a felt environmental limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harvesting unlived futures—escalates as each geode shard is spent, tightening until the protagonist’s own potential is the final currency. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is viscerally legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief commodified into resource. The geode’s dust becoming “wedding guests raising champagne flutes” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the cost of survival. No explicit thesis; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, scientifically precise yet emotionally raw. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (“tasted like my wedding cake”). Syntax modulates with pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Minor scaffold—“each facet showed futures that died”—is earned by context. No loops or mixed vehicles; final image is uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses quantum grief-harvesting with drone-war realism in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky second-person drift into “you” in the penultimate paragraph is justified by the conceptual reframe. No derivative echoes.</comment>
