<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—soles tasting dust, heart as second heartbeat—yet the “awkwardly confident” label is asserted rather than embodied; the final choice to ride sound into orbit is earned by the stone circle’s pulse and the shuttle’s awakening, so motivation coheres despite the slight label slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shuttle lifts on song, broadcasting the lullaby across militia channels—an undeniable reconfiguration of the rebellion’s pause. Causal chain (hum → duet → ignition) holds; cost is the planet left behind, felt in the whispered promise to return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned hangar is tactile—cracked ferrocrete, rusted gantries, dormant consoles—yet the stone circle beneath and the twin-sun margin act as micro-settings that constrain the final harmonic launch; specificity anchors every beat without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“keep the sky open”—tightens when the lull becomes a held breath; the stone circle’s hum escalates pressure, forcing the stargazer to convert silence into song-powered ignition. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges: rebellion as inhalation, individual as exhale. The lullaby woven into stone harmonics reweights the pause from stagnation to potential without moralizing; final image of song-trail instead of fire crystallizes the idea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded—“blue soup” of swallows, “dumb metal flowers”—with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to crescendo. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to barefoot stargazer’s perceptual signature throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language (“plasma flowers,” “coins on horizon”) is selective and pattern-taught. One mixed metaphor (“cathedral of thunderous serenity”) is minor; no loops or scaffold obscure clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of stone-henge acoustics with derelict spaceport feels inevitable; rebellion-as-breath metaphor is fresh and risk-laden. Specificity—opera glasses as lens and ignition focus—transforms familiar salvage tropes into singular vision.</comment>
