<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s interiority is textured—her bread-ritual, emerald lens, and “rescue is resonance” stance all grow from a coherent motive. Micro-choices (fitting the lens into the lute, stepping forward flour-dusted) visibly cost her social safety and anchor the ending. The shift from savior to stage-provider is earned and embodied. Minor: Milo’s shiver-recovery feels slightly expedient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chord through the emerald lens crystallizes the new communal stance with felt cost (Council boots in honey, lanterns re-igniting). Causal chain—bread scent → Milo’s arrival → lute signal → artisans’ return—holds cleanly. Orientation is swift; only one minor spatial hiccup (travertine bridge to workshop descent) but it doesn’t fracture the lens. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto’s limestone balconies, perpetual mist, and Byzantine spoons are filtered through Aurelia’s curatorial eye and constrain her tactics (sound-hole placement, honey slick). Waterfall roar modulating into harmony charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; only the “abyssal plunge pool” feels slightly ornamental. Micro-setting (lute as resonator) functions as setting-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the crafts be forgotten?”—tightens through each beat: silence, Milo’s news, Council decree, final chord. Agency is collective but Aurelia’s decisive stance (public declaration, honey trap) narrows options and forces Council retreat with visible social cost. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reliance on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and abandonment; “art is placement” crystallizes without moralizing. The emerald lens reweights from fracture to fusion; bread initials migrate from private ritual to public signal. Subtext in honey-slick floor and lute-cocoons carries the dread without naming it. Final image offers non-literal answer: resonance over rescue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—curatorial diction (“historically oriented artifacts”) braided with sensory immediacy (“cardamom and survival”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Aurelia notices through tools and textures. No head-hopping; Milo’s dialogue is spare and gasping, distinct from her measured cadence. Rhythm modulates with tension; no mechanical loops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers scent, sound, or social stakes. Figurative language is selective—“lutes hung like cocoons” earns its place. No synonym churn or scaffold. Minor: “rosewater dread” is repeated; each use reweights meaning, so the pattern is purposeful. Closure line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeper politics, curatorial ethics, and subterranean acoustics feels fresh and inevitable. The emerald lens repurposed as lute resonator is a non-obvious yet grounded transformation. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final chord. No close echoes; the grotto-city premise is specific and lived-in.</comment>
