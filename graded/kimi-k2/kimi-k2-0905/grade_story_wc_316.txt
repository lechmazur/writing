<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara/Zero’s split-soul duality is embodied in every gesture; the tremor in Zero’s wrist crystallizes shared fear. Interior contradiction pulses—“grief for the selves lost, joy for the love regained”—without therapy-speak. The final synthesis earns its cost by dissolving both parents into one body holding a laughing child.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing fluid poured over joined hands dissolves the brain and rewrites custody into singular parenthood. Causal chain holds—each confession vivifies neurons, each pulse tightens stakes—until the rewrite wave arrives and the fused survivor steps onto new earth with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Floating rock dojo, bamboo halls creaking above a rewritten Pacific, anchors who/where in the first 40 words. The jarred brain becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its glowing fluid literally vivifies their skin. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from kneeling pair to joined hands to dissolved dojo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—sole custody via emotional spark—tightens with each confession round; the brain’s violet/crystal pulses make cost visible. Agency crystallizes when Mara chooses synthesis instead of victory, foreclosing Zero’s dissolution. Pressure escalates under causal lens until the rewrite wave forces the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: “only by holding the opposite do we become real” is enacted, not stated, when two mothers fuse. Subtext lives in the brain’s glow and the child’s untranslatable word. Final image reweights the premise—one body, two memories—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, compressed, lyrical: “history rewrote itself for the seventh time that week” teaches the pattern at once. Perceptual signature fuses scientific detachment—“neural map”—with synesthetic ache—“tasting color.” No head-hopping; the final “she” remains coherent after fusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, every sentence advancing image or stake: “swirling the nutrient fluid” compresses action and metaphor. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Final cadence—“footprints already fading”—breathes perfectly after the luminous dissolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Clone-custody-via-brain-spark is a fresh synthesis of scifi and ritual combat. The gender-split opposite-self twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky fusion ending commits fully; no retreat to binary victory. Specificity—“pale jellyfish still firing micro-thoughts”—grounds the concept.</comment>
