<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Briar’s contradictory impulses—love for the enemy vs. guardianship of the trees—are dramatized through the seed’s bite and her kneeling confession; the cost is felt when the vine binds her arm, foreclosing retreat. Interiority is specific, embodied, and free of label-speak. Motivation tightens from avoidance to spoken guilt, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard rewinds counterclockwise, Briar half-bound, lake sealed—cost legible in the vine’s restraint and the confession absorbed. Causal chain (failed freeze → shattered mirror → lake summons → spoken guilt) holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by the root-bobbing and mirrored water at ~110 words; deliberate disorientation pays off in the silver mirror beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex is not backdrop; its rotating roots literally shape Briar’s path and the expanding-circle method. The mirrored lake surface becomes the final constraint, forcing confession. Sensory selection is urgent—creaking trunks, split apples like skulls—filtered through Briar’s guilt-narrowed attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“confess or remain unseen”—tightens when the mirror refuses frozen silence. Escalation is one deepening: the gyre stills, silver surface demands spoken truth. Agency is Briar’s kneeling unbending; cost is the vine’s grip and the orchard’s new secret. Pressure coheres under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of guilt and guardianship emerges from the orchard’s slow rings and the seed’s selective hunger; no moralizing. The final image—confession growing into tomorrow’s storms—reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the seed’s restraint and counterclockwise rewind invites reflection on cycles of blame and growth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“creaking like old siege towers remembering the push of war”). Perceptual signature is Briar’s: she notices rot-apple skulls and blood-steamed ice, not tourist vistas. No head-hopping; interior monologue stays concrete. Compression in “blades withdrawn from wet stone” sharpens the confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each line advances image or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—seed as prayer bead, apples as skulls—never muddled. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally. Minor elevation (“crystallized final moment”) fits the lyric register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar druid-nature trope is transformed through the flesh-eating seed that chooses comradeship over consumption. The frozen-confession mirror refusing cowardice is a fresh inflection. Specificity of the counterclockwise orchard rewind and sap-scar language makes the vision singular. Risk in lyric density pays off in resonance.</comment>
