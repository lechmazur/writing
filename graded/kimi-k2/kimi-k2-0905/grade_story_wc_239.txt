<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The witness’s interior state—former map-maker of endings turned seeker of illusion’s root—remains concrete and stakes-heightening through micro-choices (counting steps, kneeling, pressing forehead). Erasure of her name letter-by-letter offers tactile cost; final “punctured self” renunciation is earned via prior spiral walk. Flaw: late-arriving spiral arithmetic (“seven steps left...”) is told rather than embodied in motion, trimming immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the library shelves itself inside her as earned stasis, carrying both hush and spiral into whatever ‘illusion unfolds next.’ Spiral arbitration is taught early, tightened through erasure ritual, and resolved with undeniable conceptual cost—she no longer possesses a name. Causality remains coherent under accumulative/textural lens; no teleports or causal skips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Basalt column, flapping pages tasting of star-dust, and dictionary-pregnant bulge all constrain the witness’s tactics and charge the closing image (“dictionary closed like a kiss”). Spatial choreography holds; mirror of definitions provides setting-as-tool that reconfigures self-perception. Micro-setting (marble floor spiral) drives final act, cementing environment as active force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stakes—unravel cosmic illusions vs remaining witness—are anchored from entrance. Spiral intensifies stakes via word-off-page defection and memory-slide into stone; every beat narrows options toward final surrender. Cost is visible: identity erased, memories traded for orbital arbitration. One reversal is sufficient for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tangible event: illusions collapse not at apocalypse but at fusion of witness/witnessed. Final sentence reweights premise without statement: “the witness is the witnessed... spiral’s still center.” Subtext operates in silence—final hush swallowed into her pocket—charging resonance non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is highly distinct: synesthetic gust of “tasted of starlight,” spiral rhetoric, kinetic verbs like corkscrew, accretion disks. POV adheres strictly; lyrical compression (dictaphone moths, dictionary pregnant) is pattern-taught and paid off at kiss-close. No head-hop, no register drift, impeccable ear for stressed rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Syntactic variety mirrors spiral—step-step-tipping climax without loopy filler. Concrete nouns (basalt, moths) replace modifiers; no mixed metaphors except minor “accretion disks around invisible mass” which is quickly clarified. Clean grammar, zero scaffold, high density. Minor echo: “walking deeper into herself with every outward circuit”—effective rather than repetitive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms apocalyptic trope into mythic cartography of endings-as-beginnings. Fresh handling of “universe’s hiccup” folds spacetime into human heartbeats; originality arises from specificity—dictionary pages as negotiation committee. Premise commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
