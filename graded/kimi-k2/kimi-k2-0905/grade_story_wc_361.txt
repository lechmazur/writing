<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “jittery” trait is shown through clutching the pendant and racing pulse, but the interior contradiction is thin; the final acceptance feels inherited from Corwin rather than wrested under pressure. The woman’s centuries-heavy voice is asserted, not embodied. Still, the courier’s micro-choices (pausing, surrendering the pendant) track with motive and cost is felt when he loses the artifact and identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: pendant dissolves, Elias steps into myth—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain is light but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each relic carried germinates the final transformation. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no penalty. One minor causality gap: the woman’s “request” is retroactive, but the beat still tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid, selective, and filters through Elias’s courier gaze; the path as “seam where reality grew thin” directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather and light constrain visibility and metaphoric possibility without stalling motion. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias remain merely courier or become message—signals early and tightens when the pendant vibrates off-script. One meaningful deepening: pendant leaps unbidden, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual but legible: loss of prior identity. Agency is largely receptive, slightly capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-to-myth germination emerges through image sequence rather than statement; final line lets the legend “germinate” without moralizing. Subtext in the woman’s palm-up gesture reprises Corwin’s pedagogy, reconfiguring mentorship. Ambiguity remains purposeful—Elias’s new nature is felt, not defined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature strong in “negotiation between solid earth and liquid sky.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadence calms, fragments tighten at pendant leap. No head-hopping; diction remains within courier’s plausible lexicon. One lyrical lapse: “weight of centuries” is tell-not-show.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sympathetic vibration synchronize”) skirts register drift but stays patterned early enough to read as voice choice. Closure image is uncluttered and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor-fade trope is refreshed by courier-as-message inversion and aurora seam setting. Dragonfly pendant’s dissolution into sky feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk taken with accumulative, reflective structure pays off in final reconfiguration. Slight deduction for mythic cadence that flirts with archetype.</comment>
