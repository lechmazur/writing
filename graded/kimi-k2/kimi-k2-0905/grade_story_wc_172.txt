<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—guilt vs. preservation—are embodied in salt-tears and split nails; the final renunciation (leaving the egg) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete (“he’d heard them too, every night since the rivers died”). Flawed sentimentality complicates choices without safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost flock dissolves into the salt, reweighting the premise—preservation via devastation. Causal chain holds (drought → exposed map → egg release). One clean transition (storm’s lull). Cost is legible in the final image of “fractured grace that sang each time the wind crossed the waste.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Salt flat, calcified nest, and corroded music box constrain every move; the cracked mirror surface literally guides the dig. Sensory hierarchy (taste of salt, mother-of-pearl gleam) is filtered through POV urgency. Final image of salt holding the echo recharges the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the birds’ echo—tightens once: the release irrevocably trades extinction for memory. Agency is the act of winding the box and leaving the egg; cost is the permanent drought and his own haunted future. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: preservation requires destruction. Subtext lives in the music box’s arthritic click and the salt tears. Final image reweights the premise—immortality as fracture—without moralizing. Complexity lingers: no redemption, only cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is selective (“fossilized feathers that caught the weak light like mother-of-pearl”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences swell, then contract at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are precise (“thunder growled,” “melody that cracked the air like ice”). High information density: “salt tears mixing with the mineral crust” does triple duty. No line-level artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—manufactured drought to expose an extinct bird’s echo—is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test: story collapses if lithium mines or salt map removed. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity (“calcified nest,” “corroded green brass”) anchors universals.</comment>
