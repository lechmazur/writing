<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luma’s contradictory impulses—clutching grief while coaxing light—are embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the warm shard, painting with her own pooled light). The final renunciation of souvenirs in favor of internalized joy is earned by the prior cost of each brushstroke. Interiority is specific and painterly, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor cap at 8.7 because the grandfather remains off-page, so relationship pressure is inferred rather than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural’s private dawn reweights the premise—joy was not lost, only latent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each translucent glaze and pigment orbit tightens the weave until the fresco fragment grafts itself to the wall, sealing the cost. Orientation is taught early via fog folds and orchard ruins; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the “sigh of present sorrow” paid per brushstroke.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district, cider-house wall, and fog-drowned light function as micro-settings that constrain every choice: the wall must be “living,” the fog must be coaxed. Sensory detail is selective—fermented stars, pewter quilt—filtered through Luma’s painter priorities. Spatial choreography is clean: from toppled press to cider house, distances track. The final image of the mural glowing inside the fog qualifies for 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost joy—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each failed beam. Agency is exercised in the decision to paint with her own pooled light, paying a visible cost per brushstroke. Escalation follows Accumulative pattern: each pigment name orbiting her raises the stakes until the graft binds. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: joy as latent image awaiting development. The fresco fragment, film-strip projection, and final mural form a triangulation that reweights the concept without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—pocketing warmth, stepping back empty-handed. Final image offers non-literal answer: the laughing child continues inside the wall, a private dawn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and consistent: “sunbeams out of the fog,” “cinema screen waiting for its reel.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within lexicon of color and light. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer clauses for wonder, clipped fragments for cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “centuries of orchard light arrested mid-kiss” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are coherent (fog as quilt, graft as flowering tree). Minor risk of purple is reined in by tactile verbs: pocketed, pressed, grafted.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—painter who literally paints with light to develop lost memories—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of ghostly knowledge network and memory film are transformed through specific sensory craft. Risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test: story collapses if Luma were any other kind of artist.</comment>
