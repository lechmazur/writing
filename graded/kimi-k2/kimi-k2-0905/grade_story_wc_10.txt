<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s need to finish the symphony she hears inside remains explicit and steadily escalating; the fork-by-fork calibration becomes the embodied micro-choice that exposes grief and wonder. Voice stays character-specific without lapsing into therapeutic gloss. The only drag is the near-perfect emotional calibration that edges her too quickly to awe at the close.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork strike stacks heat-mapped sound into a rising visual crescendo until the conservatory blooms. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—”a sunrise trapped under ice”—a crystallized final image that reconfigures silence as lived resonance. Cost is literal in the scanner battery death, felt in Mara’s irrevocable exile from audible music. No causal holes or retroactive fixes disturb the through-line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory, the tuning fork case, and even the misted exhales are rendered through precise sensory filtration (zero-degree glass ‘bites’ mittens, frost ‘sliding like liquid notes’) that continuously constrain how Mara can ‘play.’ The dome’s thaw occurs as physical consequence tied to tonal energy. World rules remain self-consistent without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The primary stake—translate silence or risk inner deafness—tightens with each fork. Each calibration forfeits a bit more privacy and safety, the price culminating in the scanner’s death and the irretrievable archive. Absence of audible music renders each loss audible to the reader.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Silence recast as a dialect of heat and light is not preached but discovered in successive actions, culminating in that final child-shaped treble-clef cloud. Story refrains from tidy moral, allowing open after-taste.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice never slips from Mara’s perceptual bias: brass is perceived as warm river, percussion as constellation. Compression and ellipsis remain legible because the pattern (strike → heat bloom → color) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is muscular and varied; every image pushes pressure rather than decorates. No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or boilerplate cadences mar the cresting beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concept of “thermal sonics” reframes synesthesia into story mechanics rather than gimmick. Stakes, character, and closure hinge on this singular inversion, transforming a conservatory ghost walk into vital artistic reinvention.</comment>
