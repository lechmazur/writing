<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s inner tug-of-war is tracked (clinging to tuning forks while rhythms still batter her chest), but the translation from survivor guilt to translator calling is more asserted than dramatized across beats; the emotional crescendo lacks embodied cost beyond breath-clouds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight causal arc under lyrical skin: each fork strike = because producing visible thermal image therefore compounding Mara’s understanding until Conceptual Repricing lands—‘silence was never silent.’ Closure legible, momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Winterglass panes, frost sheets, and thermal aurora imagery constrain every choice; setting literally ices over sound and melts in fifths at the climax—environment reshapes outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake “translate silence” escalates from impossible vacuum to heat-map palette narrowing possibilities; each fork strike sharpens stakes while preserving cost (Mara cedes audible future, gains color language).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Emergent theme of translation-as-resistance blooms without sermon; the final frost drip reweights silence as polyglot thermal music, avoiding tidy moral while resonating with prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, slightly elevated diction is character-specific (scientist-poet hybrid); rhythm flexes with pressure levels and never head-hops. Compression and ellipsis taught early, closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud cadence, high info-density; only mild metaphor congestion near climax (“sunrise trapped under ice”). One moment of redundancy—“the audience of memories warmed in response” after the preceding thermal description—but not on closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic apocalypse turned synesthetic symphony. Risky conceit sustained; tuning-fork color notation feels newly inevitable in hindsight without stealing coherence, earning risk distinction.</comment>
