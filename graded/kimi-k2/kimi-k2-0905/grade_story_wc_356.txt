<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Myrrh’s olfactory sensitivity and ambition are embodied in every beat—testing the seed, stitching it, breathing through her mouth. The internal shift from ambition to gratitude is earned by the tree’s stillness and her mother’s passing breath. Micro-choices (folding the doodle, piercing bark) reveal hierarchy of values. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV interiority is precise and contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Myrrh’s ambition loosens into gratitude, cost legible in the relinquished notebook left for “whoever the wind-spirits were.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of scent, sway, and breath tightens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric but coherent. One transition (descent) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The treetop village is not backdrop but organism: planks narrow to “mere suggestion,” bark scars guide graft choice, wind-spirits demand fragrance. Micro-setting (bridge, cambium, indigo paper) constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: scent before sight, iron before bloom. Final image of drifting “sweet death” recharges the opening wildflower hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—fuse seed without alerting pollinators—tightens through sensory stakes and sway tolerance. One meaningful deepening: the village’s stillness astonishes her, reconfiguring her ambition. Cost is felt in the notebook relinquished and the stench risked. No external antagonist; pressure is ecological and internal, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of serenity within motion emerges from graft ritual, mother’s spirals, and final spiral of smoke around the seed. No moralizing; wisdom is dramatized in breath, sway, and relinquishment. Final image reweights earlier ambition without statement. Subtext in the exchanged breath with mother and the blank indigo paper left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and POV-anchored: “seed exhaled the faintest breath of carrion promise.” Diction stays within herbalist lexicon; syntax mirrors sway and scent. No dialogue, but interior monologue is rhythmic and specific. Patterned elision (“journalized”) is taught early and paid off in final notebook gift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “planks narrowing until the bridge became a limb, then a twig, then mere suggestion.” No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or choice. Metaphors are coherent (tide thinks, village sways). Rhythm modulates with altitude and scent intensity. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of olfactory botany, arboreal ritual, and familial custom feels fresh yet inevitable. Corpse-flower graft in a breathing treetop is specific and non-obvious. Transformation test: story collapses without scent-driven stakes and indigo doodle. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no derivative echoes.</comment>
