<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“serenely electric pins mapped constellations across her skin”), but the arc leans on a single epiphanic pivot rather than a chain of micro-choices; the final renunciation is felt yet causally compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard dissolves into a sunrise of lost broadcasts, reweighting silence from threat to cocoon. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each discarded assumption layers density until the final cadence shift releases every voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower 7, the gorge, and lunar perigee are not backdrop but active constraints: the city’s sway and moon-pull widen the literal gap that births the new transmission bridge. The hollywood star fragment and transmitter guts serve as micro-settings that guide the tuning act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the shard from devouring all transmissions—escalates through each discarded assumption, tightening until the interpreter trades her last sequin of fame for universal lullabies. Cost is visible: the gold sublimates, the coat is lighter by “one lifetime of conclusions.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: every ending is a fold where the tape loops. The shard’s dissolution reconfigures loss into return, and the gorge’s whispered voices embody the idea without exposition. No moralizing—only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to radio static and cosmic hush. Syntax breathes with lunar gravity; no head-hopping or register drift. The final “soft click of a needle” crystallizes the cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors are coherent—“antennas humming like crickets that had learned grammar”—and never obscure causality. High density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The shard-of-hush premise, hollywood star fragment, and lunar perigee synthesize into a fresh mythos of signal archaeology. Risky lyric compression pays off: the cosmic radio tower city feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
