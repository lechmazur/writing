<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for stored love yet fearing its release—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (handling the reel, scratching new lyrics). Her final renunciation of the blank letter carries visible cost: the wax seal broken, ashes in pocket. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; her spatial imagination alters tactics under pressure. The only minor slip is a faint therapeutic gloss in “love unused is not gone,” quickly redeemed by the film-strip splice image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mother’s letter is no longer blank, the stored love is released, and Mara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost—ashes in pocket, film coiled for future projection. Causal chain holds: psychometry → vision → lyric completion → envelope found. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no teleporting props. One seamless transition from booth to auditorium keeps lens coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The projection booth’s rusted reel, crystal sphere, and silver screen constrain every choice: Mara must thread the strip, the projector’s cough limits timing, the balcony seat yields the cigarette case. Micro-setting (nitrate scent, velvet curtains) filters through POV urgency. Final image—the empty seat dissolving into light—recharges the setting as vault rather than attic. Only a touch of generic “abandoned palace” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost stanza—tightens when the film moves by itself, forcing Mara to descend and confront the on-screen letter. Escalation is causal: each vision narrows options until the only path is to inscribe release. Cost is visible: the blank envelope becomes inscribed, the palace darkness redefined. No coincidence resolves; the projector’s cough is earned by prior neglect.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern: stored love loops until projected. The envelope’s transformation from blank to inscribed reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s fingertips glowing like the sphere, pigeons as white sprocket holes. Final image (ashes in pocket, coiled film) offers non-literal answer: love is never unused, only awaiting projection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “dust floated like slow film frames,” “storm without rain, like applause trapped.” Perceptual signature is spatially imaginative—Mara overlays remembered brightness onto gloom. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences for memory, fragments during threading. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Dialogue is absent, appropriate to solitary ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “She threaded the strip again, set the lamp to low, and watched her addition bloom on the vast screen like silent lightning.” No loops or scaffold; metaphors are precise and consistent. Rhythm accelerates during threading, breathes during song. Occasional elevated diction (“psychometry,” “emulsion”) fits POV expertise. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—unused love crystallized in orphaned film—feels fresh yet inevitable. Psychometry via projection booth is a non-obvious synthesis. Tropes (abandoned theater, lost letter) are transformed through tactile specificity: nitrate scent, sprocket-hole pigeons. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
