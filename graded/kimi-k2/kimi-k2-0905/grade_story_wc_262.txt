<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s yearning is embodied in tactile ritual (tweezers, crystal, projector) and drives every beat; the mother-lovesong link gives interior contradiction real cost. Micro-choices—scratching new lyrics, threading the reel—externalize shift from hoarding to release. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of epiphany (“love unused is not gone…”) that momentarily flattens the embodied arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust, nitrate scent, monochrome beam) thickens until the added lyric frame reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing reel stored in her chest—whose cost is the blank letter now permanently inked and relinquished. Causality is lyric rather than plot, but the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Projection booth, balcony seat, and cigarette case are handled, not catalogued; their 20-year decay constrains what Mara can touch or alter. The micro-setting of perforated film edges and sprocket holes becomes the conduit for love’s release. Rain finally hitting the marquee externalizes the internal splice, locking atmosphere to arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the lost stanza to complete the mother’s goodbye—tightens once: blank paper → complete chorus. The tightening is single but decisive, forcing Mara to inscribe release instead of preservation. Cost is legible: the letter leaves her possession forever, ashes in pocket.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accreted motif of “unused love” as stored energy that demands projection, not possession. Final image—film strip nesting inside her chest—reprises the incubation idea without moralizing. Subtext in the unmailed letter and blank paper carries the emotional irony that only the daughter’s surrender can finish the mother’s song.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s spatial imagination; perceptual signature is cinematic (“slow film frames,” “white sprocket holes against the night”). Syntax lengthens and contracts with the projector’s rhythm, teaching the reader the lyric cadence early. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction feels native to a crystal-gazer who thinks in light beams.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm mirrors mechanical whir and emotional crescendo; sentence variety avoids template cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned—film metaphors are taught and repaid—so no artifact penalty. Only hairline slip: “incubate the leftover feelings” is slightly clinical amid otherwise sensory phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fuses psychometry, abandoned cinema, and orphaned film into a fresh emotional engine: love as literal footage that must be re-threaded to run forward. The mother’s unsent letter becoming the blank page Mara must complete is an inevitable twist that feels newly minted. Risk—lyric rather than causal plot—heightens coherence without obscuring stakes.</comment>
