<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific; the summoner’s contradictory impulses (to speak vs. to hush) are dramatized through micro-choices like pressing the wing to his sternum. Motivation is rooted in past trauma yet intensifies under present pressure. The final swallowing of the sphere is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor: no second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sphere swallowed reweights the world—birdsong is “innocent” again. Causal chain holds: map silence → fold cranes → speak “.” → vacuum swallows prophecy → internalized cost. Orientation is immediate; lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught by pattern of hush-accumulation and paid off in final galaxy image. Cost is legible: “inside his chest the sphere still rotated.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Brook, moonlight, reeds, and paper cranes are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the water’s flow constrains every tactical move. Micro-setting (origami wing) becomes the vessel and later the galaxy, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis: “tasted copper” as code bleeds. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silence must defeat encoded prophecy—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. Agency is exercised via mapping, folding, and the spoken “.”; cost is the swallowed sphere that forever murmurs against bone. One meaningful deepening: drumbeat faltering when confronted by grammar of ending. No reversals needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—tranquility as mastery of fire, not absence—emerges from concrete acts: folding hush, swallowing prophecy. Subtext operates in gesture (tucking crane behind ear) and image (private galaxy). Final reconfiguration reweights prior material without moralizing: “to carry quiet is never silent.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—selective attention to hush, ripple, heart-space. Syntax modulates with pressure: long cadences for mapping, single spoken “.” as gate. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Experimental elisions (“.” spoken aloud) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “terrestrially cosmic” repeats but serves motif. No loops or synonym churn. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—summoner who folds silence into cranes to devour prophecy—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Tropes (lone mage, origami familiar) are transformed through embodied cost and cosmic scale. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific detail (paper wing pulse matching brook) anchors universals.</comment>
