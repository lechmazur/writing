<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s quietly deliberate nature is embodied in her tactile, methodical handling of the key and the automaton; the moment she trades her own wandering shadow to anchor everyone else’s crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is sparse but precise, and the final whispered rune shows a micro-choice that seals her transformation. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s decisive act of placing the key into her shadow’s hands re-weights reality, restoring noon’s shadows at the price of her own former detachment. Causal chain—key → automaton → spiral walk → sacrifice—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; the island, orrery floor, and drifting chronology are anchored within 120 words and serve the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory’s brass rings and mirrored automaton chest function as micro-setting that directly constrain Lyra’s looping path; the moonshadow sundial at the impossible fold of time charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—moonlight angle, brass clicks, mirror void—each guiding choice rather than decorating. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Lyra rotates the rings and steps the Möbius spiral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the world’s lost shadows—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Lyra realizes she must surrender her own. One meaningful deepening: the automaton’s hollow chest reveals her detached shadow, forcing the trade-off. Cost is felt on page: her silhouette, once restless, now kneels obediently, and the fused key heart-valve signals irreversibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of sealing absence: “some awakenings must be sealed before they can be safely opened.” Subtext operates in the silent migration of shadows and the final note’s invitation to close one’s own circle. No moralizing; the open eye balanced on a spoon rune offers resonant, non-literal wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, matching Lyra’s quiet deliberation: “clockwork automaton slumped beside the transit telescope” compresses world and mood. Syntax tightens under pressure—“gears reversed, dragging the observatory’s rings”—mirroring retrograde heartbeat. No dialogue; narrative texture alone carries subtext and urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and free of loops: each sentence layers image, motion, and consequence. Metaphors are precise—“constellations poured like liquid”—and never muddle causality. Rhythm accelerates through the spiral walk and settles into the hushed final cadence, earning the lyrical close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The spoon-bent reality premise is transformed through tactile specificity: brass rings, moonshadow sundial, fused key-heart. Risky structural choice—walking a Möbius strip to invert inside/outside—pays off in a reconfiguration that feels inevitable. No close echoes; the final sigil of “an open eye balanced on a spoon” is fresh and integral.</comment>
