<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s quiet deliberation is shown through tactile ritual (tracing the key, winding backward) that escalates to self-sacrifice; the interior contradiction—yearning to restore shadows while surrendering her own—drives every beat. The only slack is the single-sentence epiphany “Lyra understood…” which tells rather than dramatizes the leap; still, the final stance is earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused key/heart and the restored world create a charged poise whose cost is her perpetual exile aloft. Causal chain holds—key→automaton→Möbius spiral→shadow reunion—each step foreclosing options. The spoon-bent reality rule is taught early and never broken; orientation is anchored by word 60. One causal micro-gap: how Lyra intuits the “method demanded” is told, not cued, but it lands inside the lyric lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orrery floor, brass rings, and moonlit key function as micro-setting that literally constrains her path; every rotation tightens her choices. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (gloved fingers, clock-spring voice). The floating isle never becomes postcard scenery because its altitude becomes the price she pays. Only the continental view from the balcony drifts toward generic sublime, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shadows’ absence—tightens through each backward click; the final reversal fuses her own shadow to the machine, a visible forfeiture. Pressure escalates by accumulative pattern: each loop peels away another layer of self until inside/outside invert. No external antagonist is needed; the geometry itself supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible on-page: the automaton’s fused key-chest and her marooned silhouette.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “remembering what absence teaches” emerges from the image circuit of hollow mirrors, vanished silhouettes, and the final open-eye spoon sigil—never stated until the whispered rune, whose shape crystallizes the reconfiguration. Subtext operates in gesture: her shadow kneeling palms-up performs the story’s argument about reclamation through surrender. No moralizing final sentence; the lullaby hum lets the reader carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cerebral, its syntax elongated like clockwork unwinding: “stars outside smeared into silver spoons.” The diction stays within a scholar’s lexicon without academic leakage. Compression is taught early (“time creased like crumpled parchment”) and paid off in the liquid constellations. One rhythmic hiccup: three consecutive sentences opening with “The…” in the balcony paragraph, but the pattern is not systemic enough to break cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—action + metaphoric reverb—without scaffold. No paraphrase loops; each image extends the spoon/shadow motif rather than repeating it. Metaphors stay physically coherent (Möbius band of night) and avoid mixed vehicles. A single filter-verb cluster (“she saw her own shadow—detached, waving goodbye”) is justified as focalizer shock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The spoon-bent reality and shadow migration invert familiar tropes into a fresh cosmology; the rune ᚦ as “sealed awakening” reweights Norse futhorc into conceptual engine. Risk-taking—Möbius topology as plot device—pays off narratively and thematically. Specificity (iris diaphragms widening like memory) prevents abstraction from floating free. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, meeting the 9+ transformation test.</comment>
