<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—exile as escape vs. legacy as burden—are embodied in the copper nail and drive every micro-choice; the final renunciation to stay carries palpable cost. Interiority is concrete and specific; no stock phrasing. The thumbprint in verdigris crystallizes earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s choice to remain rewrites both her own exile and Edda’s erasure. Causal chain holds—each stanza decoded narrows options until the wreck’s discovery forces the final stance. Cost is legible in the copper nail’s permanent scar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Weather Station Cirrus-9 is evoked through spongey plankwalks, mildewed aluminum, and screaming barometers; the environment constrains every action. The copper nail functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring Edda’s erased bravery—tightens with each decoded stanza. The nine-nautical-mile revelation narrows options and forces the dawn launch. Cost is visible: the copper nail brands Mara’s palm, the Ministry’s denial scars the sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as weather, bravery as inconvenient truth. The final etched coordinates refract “purposeful direction instead of anonymous dread,” reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the nail’s coffin origin and the thumbprint’s verdigris.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—Mara’s perceptual signature filters every detail through cartographic precision and salt-cipher hunger. Rhythm modulates with squall intensity. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers map, weather, and legacy. Figurative language is purposeful—“sky’s spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies” charges closure. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of meteorology, archival obsession, and reversible exile feels inevitable yet fresh. The salt-cipher micro-maps invert coastlines in a way only this voice could devise. Risk-taking (lyric density, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
