<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but remains character-specific; the bamboo whisk and calloused fingers anchor embodied knowledge. Motive—"to appreciate hidden effort"—is stated early and re-asserted through ritual action, yet the final renunciation (stepping onto shadow) feels slightly abstract; cost is poetic rather than visceral. Still, her micro-choices (whisking air, whistling) track a coherent arc from observation to participation in the pattern she studies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the philosopher steps onto a staircase of absence, crystallizing her new stance as invisible maintainer. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each whisk stroke thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; causality is lyrical but legible. Cost is conceptual (erasure of footprints, perpetual vanishing) rather than concrete, yet undeniable within the story’s logic.</comment>

<comment>Whispering parapet, wet flagstones, and fireflies create a tactile micro-cosmos; the bamboo whisk doubles as both tool and setting-constraint, guiding motion and attention. Weather (rain, cloud-crossed moon) directly alters visibility and stakes. Spatial choreography is clean; the descent along moon-path shadows is tracked without drift. Environment and body mutually shape choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—revealing hidden patterns—tightens through each whisk stroke and firefly constellation; the final shadow path narrows options to a single act of trust. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but pressure remains coherent. A visible price (footprints erased, self-erasure) is implied; stronger visceral cost would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: maintenance, invisibility, and the ethics of unseen labor. Subtext resides in gesture—the whisk stirring moonlight—rather than declaration. Final image reframes prior nets and knots as metaphysical ligatures without moralizing. Resonance lingers because the philosopher’s choice embodies the theme rather than articulating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, and philosophically precise; diction favors “scintillatingly somber wonder” and “demure audacity,” both coined yet apt. Rhythm modulates with ascent and descent, mirroring breath. No dialogue, yet the wind-taught whistle functions as spoken ritual. Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive, meriting high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative layering (“fireflies drift like sparks from an invisible forge”) is purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly”) risks purple but stays within character’s philosophical register. Minor risk of overwriting does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending, moon-path geometry, and tea-whisk ritual creates a singular mythic micro-culture. Tropes (philosopher-hermit, firefly season) are transformed through occupational specificity and embodied philosophy. Risk-taking (walking on absence) heightens stakes without gimmickry; inevitability feels earned in hindsight.</comment>
