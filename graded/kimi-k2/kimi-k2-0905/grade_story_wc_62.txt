<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choices (ribbon press, chisel tap) reveal hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—softness vs. stone—act simultaneously under pressure. The final renunciation (no name on the gravestone) is earned by prior causality and carries visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral carved in stone reweights collective grief with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reversed stride adds density until the ribbon-dye constellation crystallizes. No orientation debt; greenhouse anchors by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s moss, rust, and cracked slate constrain movement and mirror decay. The avocado tree’s root-cracked cist becomes the literal pivot for the final act. Sensory hierarchy (scent of lilies, sap like marble) is filtered through Elara’s carver perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape collective grief before butterflies depart—is signaled early and tightened by each reversed footstep. Agency: Elara’s decision to dye the ribbon and release the pattern narrows options (she forfeits personal memorial for communal rite). Cost is visible in the sap-pale ribbon tied aloft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from spiral-as-gyre image: grief widens rather than circles. Subtext in the ghost’s lily-scent name and the traded poem stanzas. Final image reweights premise—stone learns to remember through living dye—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: carver’s tactile attention to stone, sap, and dye. Rhythm modulates from meditative slowness to thundering calm. No head-hopping; ghost’s voice remains external resonance. Compression in “We are the echo learning its own name” is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“glass panes rattling like loosened teeth in the jaw of time” does triple work. Metaphor coherence maintained; no mixed vehicles. Final line “laughed, the sound startling a cloud of butterflies” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carver + spectral mentorship + butterfly migration as grief cartography. Spiral gyre concept transforms familiar mourning ritual into living constellation. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off; premise could not survive name or setting swap.</comment>
