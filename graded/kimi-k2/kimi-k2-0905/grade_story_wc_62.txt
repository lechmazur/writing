<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The carver’s quiet, stone-slow interiority and the butterfly-guided revelation feel lived-in, but her early passivity and limited micro-choices during the climax mute the decisive change expected at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>One seamless scene, a clear causal arc (quiet carving → butterfly route → greenhouse epiphany), and a resonant reconfiguration earned through prior beats. Grandmother’s disembodied mentorship and final ribbon-to-wings transformation reweights grief into active memorial-making.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Crystal-vibrating greenhouse, cracked terracotta, and oak-tombstone entwinement are tactile and burdensome; the space physically narrows options and visually mirrors collective grief’s weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>A single escalating pressure—grief too heavy to speak—tightens through poem trades and culminates in chrysalis of poems; the cost (carving in sleep) lands, though it’s summarized rather than dramatized on page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief-as-transformation emerges through metaphoric butterfly chrysalis; subtext in traded poems and unspoken loss is effective, though final “learned” epiphany leans slightly declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, meditative voice is consistent and embodied; slight register drift in the grandmother’s thunder-calm speech risks distancing, yet rhythmic control during storm crescendo keeps tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lush but purposeful; sentence rhythm accelerates with storm buildup. Some metaphor layering (“thundering calm” tautology) and gentle glide from “grief felt heavier” intrude in apex beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Grief-as-gardens is a fresh inversion of memorial stones; specific poem titles woven into butterfly wings provides unmistakable signature even within familiar magical-realist terrain.</comment>
