<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“latent radiance of all forgotten thirsts pulsed inside it”), but the arc leans on abstract destiny rather than contradictory impulses in-scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: reverse yoyo → counter-gears → time-fold → slit string → workshop reset; the mural prophecy pays off the orientation debt, and the cracked stone’s coldness is an unmistakable on-page cost that reweights possibility. Lens stays causal to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt slickness, copper-thread hair string, and the tower breathing like a bell are selective, pressure-driven details; the lighthouse itself constrains the torque experiment and reappears emptied in the coda, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape dawn death—tightens when each failed yoyo trick loosens a brick and the stone grows visibly heavier; the fold forces an either/or that he slices open, paying the price of his gift. One clear escalation line under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trading prophecy for possibility emerges through the yoyo’s reversal and the forward-ticking clocks; no moralizing, only the cracked stone’s silence and the nameless greeting to judges, a resonant reconfiguration that invites counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured and clockmaker-specific—“reverse-engineer the puzzle of the ancient yoyo”—with rhythmic control under pressure; compressed lyric elision is taught early and paid off at the spiral door, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density—“time folded like paper”—with varied sentence rhythm; one mixed metaphor (“dying star” dragging downward) and a near-loop (“slow exhale of low tide” repeated) keep it from 9, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The counterclock-clockmaker who weaponizes a rusted yoyo as an escapement to tear time is a fresh, risk-laden synthesis; the hunger stone’s drought warning repurposed as temporal fuel feels inevitable yet non-obvious, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
