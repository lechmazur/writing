<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The clock-maker’s contradictory impulses—yearning to outrun death yet relinquishing his gift—are embodied in every tactile choice; the final renunciation costs him his art and lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lattice holds: each yoyo attempt loosens bricks → reveals gears → demands counter-torque → births the clockwise door; the cut string severs prophecy and reconfigures time on the page with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Basalt steps, rusted yoyo, hunger-stone ember, and levitating bricks are never backdrop; they physically constrain motion and charge the final workshop image where the cracked stone sits spent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single stake—escape pre-dawn death—tightens with every failed trick; the cost escalates from loosened bricks to lost gift, culminating in a decisive trade-off legible under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of agency versus fate emerges through concrete reversals; the cracked hunger stone and forward-ticking clocks reweight the premise without sermon, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; phrases like “latent radiance of all forgotten thirsts” feel character-bound, and compression heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density; each sentence advances image or causality. Metaphors (“dying star,” “hourglass dripping in reverse”) serve pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Reversing time via a yoyo escapement is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight; the synthesis of clockwork, drought stone, and lighthouse gears feels singular and risk-heightened.</comment>
