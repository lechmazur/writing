<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the narrator’s guilt and longing pulse through every beat. The brother’s frozen fourteen-year-old self is sketched with aching specificity. Motivation—seeking the unspoken apology—drives every micro-choice. Cost is felt when the shard dissolves and the letters become moths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology seeds forward, reconfiguring both past and future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final drop of water heals the lip. Causality is lyric but legible: shard → mirror → corridor → spoken word. Cost is crystallized in the empty pocket and the warm rainspout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth breathes, constraining movement and guiding choice; its salt air and singing spirits are not backdrop but pressure. The shard, the window-condensation, and the root-corridor function as micro-settings that force action. Spatial choreography is coherent; bodies and objects track cleanly. Final image—the warm rainspout—recharges every prior motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the apology be spoken?—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. The medium’s guidance, the shard’s transformation, and the corridor’s opening escalate pressure under the Accumulative lens. The protagonist’s agency crystallizes in kneeling and offering the shard. Cost is the irreversible release of the shard and the letters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: apology as living seed, not echo. Subtext operates in gesture—the shard offered, the moths released—never in statement. The final image of the warm rainspout reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; every sentence carries salt and moonlight. Perceptual signature is distinct: “tide-pool silver,” “barnacle-wrapped tenderness.” No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses at climax, longer breaths in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every image advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful and patterned—moonlight as both wound and healer. Read-aloud rhythm is musical without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—entering the seam before an apology—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of ghostly guides and magical objects are transformed through fierce tenderness and ecological specificity. The synthesis of mangrove spirits, gargoyle shard, and unsent letters is non-obvious yet coherent. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
