<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Protagonist’s interiority combines guilty paralysis and longing without cliché; the moment of apology is textured through embodied emotion (“moonlight knitting crystals”) and completes a textured arc of refusal-turned-renunciation—closure is clean and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Closure is a crystallizing Charged Poise: the spoken “I’m sorry” seeds the brother’s future, reconfiguring regret into motion under an inferred causal lens guided by the shard’s journey. Causality threads every beat without break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mangrove labyrinth’s breathing roots double as micro-setting that constrains motion and metaphysical corridor; sensory thrust is specific (salt tide, moonlit lungs) and folds into action without static catalogue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unspoken apology—intensifies via escalating spatial and temporal pressure until the final corridor forecloses the avoidance path; felt cost is the acknowledged loss of years and unspoken truths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the paradox that apology only exists in the space before it is spoken; iterative returns of “come back whole” and lunar cycles reprice the emotional rule-set without ever lecturing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Consistently lyrical yet grounded; first-person interiority modulates between child-memories and adult guilt without strain. Singing-spirit voices feel indigenous, never expository filter words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm mirrors tides; each clause advances pressure (“footprints closed like skin behind her”). No loops, zero ornamental metaphors; clarity even at peak spiritual chorus.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Moment-before-deciding framing, gargoyle shard as reflective conduit, and singing spirits cohere as one synthesized whole; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
