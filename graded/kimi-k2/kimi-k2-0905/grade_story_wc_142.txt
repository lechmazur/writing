<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lina’s “culture-shock absorber” title tells more than shows early on, yet her interior tension—dreading tugs yet needing continuity—grounds every choice. The stone chip’s ritualistic kneading feels intimate; body, memory, and threat pulse in a single gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closing “we are still becoming” grafitti reprice offers Resonant Reconfiguration: the carnival survives, but at the mutable cost of letting change in. One tight, legible drive accumulates from encoded wall marks to inspectors’ retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “three kilometers off the drowned coast” is repeated via wake smells, rope flex, salt-bruised wood; distance and motion constrain every tactic. Raft geography becomes a character the cast keeps retuning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The privatization threat is clear; the actual tightening turns on graffiti re-positioning the entire layout overnight. One on-page reversal forecloses passive surrender with visible social cost (disruption, sleepless crews).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Theme of adaptable heritage versus saleable culture emerges from the decision to invert the decks rather than moralize. The image of mocked corporate grins on carnival masks crystallizes without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>The voice is textured, sensorial, never neutral: “popcorn smoke” over water, “gold-toothed pipes.” Sustained close-third remains stable while letting lyric rhythm echo the calliope wheeze—it teaches its cadence early and delivers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Phrases do double duty: “dark from remembering land prices” compresses history and dread. Some micro loops (“giggled, and their laughter felt like ballast”) lightly echo themselves but never clog momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>This drowned-carnival raft city is freshly alive: tarot tents, sunrise bread for barefoot queues, encoded grafitti resistance. Tropes float but are re-weighted by the specific lived ritual of Lina’s stone-chip habit.</comment>
