<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulses—preserve vs. survive—surface in every beat (graffiti choice, midnight speech, sunrise sabotage). The stone chip embodies her lineage and doubt; its final release crystallizes an earned, costly stance. Interiority is textured, embodied, and specific; no therapy-speak. One minor slip: the “culture shock absorber” label is asserted rather than dramatized in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the city’s overnight reconfiguration reweights options while the Syndicate retreats, cost legible in Lina’s thumping necklace and the unreadable deck. Causal chain holds: graffiti summons → midnight plan → dawn sabotage → inspectors baffled. Orientation is immediate; transitions are clean. One micro-drag: inspectors’ confusion summarized rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft city’s pontoons, popcorn smoke, and shifting decks constrain every choice; even the stone chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Lina’s priorities. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. Corporate teal and surveyor orange are vivid antagonistic intrusions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carnival’s survival vs. commodification—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened through each beat. Lina’s agency drives escalation: graffiti signal, midnight plan, dawn sabotage. Cost is visible—loss of certainty, possible scuttling, mocked investors. One beat could be sharper: inspectors’ retreat feels slightly off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “becoming vs. owning” emerges through carnival masks painted over logos, dissolving rice-paper poems, and Lina’s final search for a new symbol. Subtext in graffiti codes and children’s riddles resists moralizing. Final image of the unreadable city offers resonant, non-literal answer. One near-slip: “culture shock absorber” flirts with thematic label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (“colors that felt wrong”) is unmistakably Lina’s. Syntax modulates with urgency; carnival argot never slips into exposition. No head-hopping; POV distance is consistent. Compression and elision (e.g., “gravity became negotiable”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is purposeful—no purple drift. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by voice. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: floating carnival as resistance organism, graffiti as tactical language, privatization as creeping color. No close echoes; premise is fully inhabited. Risk-taking (overnight citywide reorganization) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
