<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chen’s contradictory impulses—spy’s reflex to encode vs. sage’s urge to vanish—play out in embodied micro-choices (palming film, slipping fortune, rowing away). The final renunciation costs him identity and home, earned by prior beats where every fortune he wrote became shackles. Interiority stays concrete, never diagnostic. Voice distinct in cadence and lexicon.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Chen’s deliberate disappearance forecloses the spy path with visible cost—he trades specs for blank paper, island for wind. Causal chain holds: each fortune seeded consequences, the keeper’s pocketed slip triggers recognition too late. Lens is causal; no orientation debt. One transition (stairs to skiff) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse, granite spine, and turning beam constrain every move—exposure, escape route, final image. Salt wind and moonlit combers act as metronome; the lithophone island literally tunes his ribs. Spatial choreography precise; no white-room drift. Environment charges the final Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: freedom from the prophecy trap. Pressure tightens when the accidental line “rock inside you” begins to manifest; Chen’s only escape is self-exile. One decisive tightening—rowing away—pays the price of permanent severance. No coincidence resolves; keeper’s late realization complicates, not rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges: the danger of words that outlive their author. Subtext in every gesture—fortune as handcuff, light as confession. Final image of island humming a chord he now carries reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is freedom real or another encoded fate?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, with salt-stung diction and rhythmic pulse matching beam rotations. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Chen. Dialogue sparse, subtext-laden (“the sea keeps its secrets by speaking them aloud”). Microdot specs and hollow bolt handled with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: “moonlit combers smash the granite spine—white explosions that looked like negatives” does triple duty. Rhythm accelerates during escape, breathes during reflection. No mixed metaphors; every image serves atmosphere or stakes. Clean grammar, purposeful fragments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spy-thriller gadgetry meets maritime myth, fortune-cookie koans as cryptographic payloads. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Transformation test: swap island for city and the emotional arc collapses. Specificity of lithophone granite and Fresnel lens feels inevitable.</comment>
