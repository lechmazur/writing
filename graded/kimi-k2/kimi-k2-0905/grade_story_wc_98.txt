<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calyx’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot press on basalt, the coppery seed on her tongue—but the climactic memory-for-trade choice arrives with only a single line of hesitation; the teacher’s name vanishes without a prior micro-choice that shows its weight, so the cost feels declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal arc is tight: ridge erosion threat → dream entry → fissure found → seed planted → memory lost → ridge saved. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost—“her mind hollow where a mentor’s name had been”—and the lens holds as every beat follows because/therefore logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge itself becomes a character: warm basalt underfoot, vanilla lattice overhead, dragon-scale plates in dream. Each sensory detail constrains action—orchid fibers braided into the fissure—and the final image of the flowering spine standing against monsoon is charged by the setting’s tactile presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—ridge collapse—escalates through a single decisive tightening: the monochrome canyon widens unless doubt is woven. The price (loss of mentor’s name) is visible on the page and alters Calyx’s future tactics, satisfying the closure cost test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory survives not because it is true but because people agree to guard it while knowing they might be wrong. The final image of “luminous doubt” crystallizes this without sermon, reweighting every prior petal and fissure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined—“orchids and iron” darkness, “luminous fish” smiles—anchored in Calyx’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping; dream transitions are signaled by sensory shift rather than rupture. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer coils for wonder, clipped beats for urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. Occasional near-purple (“empirically whimsical hush”) is pattern-taught early and paid off, so it reads as texture rather than clutter. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors in the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The reality-checker who trades her own certainty to save collective uncertainty is a fresh synthesis; the dream-dragon ridge made of layered memory feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
