<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremor of certainty in her pulse”), but the poet’s contradictory impulses are more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned yet feels slightly abstract rather than personally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake’s unsealing and the colonnade’s silence crystallize the new order with visible conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly from first quartz note to final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (quartz pillars, lantern-moths, ice) is selective and purpose-driven; the lake’s phase-change directly constrains and then enables the final crossing, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewrite law through art—tightens via each paraphrase; the single decisive intensification (ice becomes membrane) forecloses the old prohibition with felt environmental cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: borders as mutable language, law as draft light; the final couplet offers a resonant, non-moral answer that reweights all prior imagery without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed syntax, internal rhyme, synesthetic leaps—remains controlled and purposeful; no head-hopping, psychic distance stable, voice modulates with emotional crest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; occasional poetic stacking (“lantern-moth hush regathered, richer now with possibility’s tremor”) risks overwriting but never stalls momentum or muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar liberation-of-art trope is transformed through crystalline specificity: quartz harmonics, phoneme shift “None shall stay,” ice-wings; the synthesis feels inevitable and risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
