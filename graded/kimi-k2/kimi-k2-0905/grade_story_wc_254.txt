<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is vivid—her pulse as recusant signature, her aesthetic creed driving each step—but we never see contradictory impulses collide in-scene; the risk of mispronunciation is stated, not dramatized. The final couplet crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied. Still, the voice is singular and the arc coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the lake re-liquifies, law becomes environment, and the colonnade falls silent—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than stepwise; the pattern is taught early and held. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors remain stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>From the first line the cobalt atrium, quartz pillars, and lantern-moth hush are sensuously anchored; the frozen lake’s phase-change constrains every footfall. Micro-setting (quartz lattice, ice membrane) doubles as tool and antagonist. Final image of ice folding into wings recharges the opening tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“dissolve the boundary law”—is signaled early and escalates through each paraphrased syllable; the tightening is the ice’s audible shift from solid to chorus. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the poet risks becoming a statue of precedent. Agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as environmental force, borders as editable text. The final couplet reframes the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the quartz’s A-flat, the moths’ green glow—images that reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-oracular, syntactically lush yet disciplined; perceptual signature is unmistakable—“lantern-moth hush,” “cobalt glass calligraphy.” Compression and elision are pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the poet’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image, sound, and concept without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—ice as moral surface, quartz as resonant throat. No loops or scaffold; minor elevated diction is voice-motivated. Final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of legal decree, musical architecture, and glacial physics feels freshly synthesized. Risk-taking (law rewritten as refracted light) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: the story would collapse if any named element were swapped.</comment>
