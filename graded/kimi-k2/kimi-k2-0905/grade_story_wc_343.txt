<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning for discovery while fearing the ship’s death—drives every micro-choice; the moment she kneels to trace spirals embodies both curiosity and desperation. The final act of reading aloud crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she trades private grief for communal light. Relationships remain off-stage, but her isolation is credibly embodied and then dissolved through the shared glow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship’s lamps blaze anew, the crew’s maps fold into one horizon, and Lira’s chalk line becomes the next destination—cost paid in her mother’s fragment and her own vulnerability. Causal chain is tight: hopscotch spirals → phrasebook translation → light-feed ignition → collective course. No orientation drift; anchors set within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Brass-ribbed airship, moonlit cargo deck, and chalk-scuffed floorboards are rendered with tactile economy; each constrains Lira’s movements and choices. The hopscotch board evolves from abandoned game to navigational key, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but selective detail (silver ladders of moonlight, flour-fine dust) mirrors internal stakes without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the dying ship—tightens through Lira’s agency; each beat narrows options from wandering to deciphering to performing the story. The reversal is her decision to share private grief aloud, costing secrecy and risking ridicule, yet reigniting the engines. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence (starling helix) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living cartography that can re-light the world. Subtext hums in the half-erased chalk and the phrasebook’s “light remembers its way home.” Final image of shared horizon avoids moralizing, offering instead a resonant reconfiguration of isolation into communion. No thematic drift; every motif serves the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a cartographer’s eye for pattern and a grieving daughter’s ache. Syntax modulates from languid observation (“brass ribs creaking like an old librarian”) to urgent imperative (“Now let’s give her a destination”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Lira’s throughout. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in silence and shared glances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. Metaphors (candle unsure whether to gutter or blaze) are fresh and coherent. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are surgical. Final line (“story that would not be stranded again”) lands clean, recharging earlier motifs without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of antique airship, linguistic cartography, and starling murmuration feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The hopscotch board as celestial map is a non-obvious synthesis that transforms grief into navigation. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; the vision is singular and fully committed.</comment>
