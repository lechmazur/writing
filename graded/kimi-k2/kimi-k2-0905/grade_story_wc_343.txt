<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is embodied in tactile beats (tracing coastlines, blowing dust, reading aloud) and her interior contradiction—yearning for inclusion yet choosing solitary discovery—drives the climax. The mother’s phrasebook functions as an externalized motive that converts to decisive action under pressure, earning the ship’s re-ignition and the crew’s recognition. Cost is visible: she remains alone at the chart table, but the air now “carries shared light,” a credible partial satisfaction. Voice stays particular; no diagnostic self-talk or stock phrases intrude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship’s lamps blaze anew, the crew’s maps fold into one horizon, and Lira’s private spiral becomes a named passage—cost is the continuing solitude inside communal light. Causal chain holds: hopscotch scuffs → translated spirals → spoken dialects → light-feed ignites → shared destination. Orientation is clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One scaffold paraphrase (“stranded luminance” repeated) keeps it sub-9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Airship is lived-in: brass ribs creak, copper pipes sweat, moonlight stripes cargo grates—details filter through Lira’s cartographer gaze and constrain her choices (she reads the floor as a map). Starling murmuration externalizes the spiral pattern she later speaks aloud, charging the final image. No geography drift; scale stays micro and purposeful. One missing sensory anchor (sound of engines at climax) prevents 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ship’s dying light vs. Lira’s need to prove language-as-latitude—tightens when she alone can feed the “story-bulb.” Mid-story micro-turn: hopscotch scuffs shift from child’s game to navigational key, narrowing options to “speak or drift ghost.” Her recitation escalates under time pressure; starlings mirror the act, making the cost visible in collective gaze. Persistent constraint: the phrasebook is finite; once used, its mystery is spent—felt but not over-dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—language as hidden latitude—emerges through pattern, not statement: chalk spirals, bird helix, spoken dialects, newly inked passage. Final image reweights earlier isolation: shared horizon drawn by her hand, yet she remains apart, complicating the triumph. No moralizing; meaning stays implicit. One near-echo of “light remembers its way home” flirts with Echo but is saved by its function as ignition fuel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Lira’s perceptual bias—coastlines that “insist they don’t exist,” lamps “unsure whether to gutter or blaze.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during sprint to engine galley, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; crew dialogue is filtered through her ears, preserving distance. One register lift (“conceptual repricing”) sits in narration beyond her lexicon, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene: long sensory sentences aboard quiet deck, staccato verbs during light crisis. Metaphors are coherent—starlings as uncharted currents, lamps as faltering heart—never mixed. One paraphrase loop (“stranded luminance” 2×) and a filter-stack (“she sensed, she felt”) dock 0.3. Otherwise high density: dust, chalk, dialect, steam delivered without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of linguistic cartography and living airship feels fresh; the hopscotch-board-as-map is a specific, memorable inflection. Starling double-helix payoff grows credibly from earlier bird imagery. Premise risks whimsy but grounds itself in tactile procedure and earned cost. Slight whiff of “story as fuel” trope keeps it sub-9.</comment>
