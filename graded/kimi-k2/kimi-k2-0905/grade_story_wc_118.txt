<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and specific (“felt nothing, the way a tuning fork feels after the last note has gone”). Motive—collecting stories walls have heard—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation (becoming the axis) is earned and costly. Flaws and contradictions are present but not foregrounded; still, the arc is credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian trades solitude to become the displaced axis, cost legible in “carrying nothing—because the story, at last, carried her.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of diary fragments → tapestry → silo wall teaches the reader early and lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reclaimed silo library is tactile and constraining—spiral walkway, concrete bay, copper glow through high windows. The micro-setting (tapestry pressed to wall) becomes the pivot for the final reconfiguration. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the axis and decide what to do with it. Pressure tightens via each diary fragment; the final beat forces a choice—merge with the axis or remain alone. Cost is felt in the blank tapestry and the historian’s emptied hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory, reclamation, and the cost of bearing witness. Subtext lives in silence (“bronze quiet”), the blank tapestry, and the historian’s final step into “starless dark.” No moralizing; resonance is earned through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression (“soot-flecked handwriting,” “threads tightening like muscles remembering an old flight”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“dragons circling that invisible pivot”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise—post-human archivist realigning the world’s axis via half-burned diaries and a dragon tapestry—is non-obvious and fully committed. Synthesis of mythic and post-apocalyptic feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (loose fortress stone, bronze quiet) anchors universals.</comment>
