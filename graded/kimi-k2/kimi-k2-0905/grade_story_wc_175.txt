<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrically specific (“ghost of its texture against her fingertips”), but her contradictory impulses stay mostly summarized rather than enacted in live beats; the final renunciation is earned yet emotionally monotone because the on-page cost is only lightly embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released wire-cathedral reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, taught early by the repeating knotting motif and paid off when the structure dissolves into migration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s cloud-soil and transient roots directly constrain Elara’s kneeling posture and the memorial’s lifespan; the monarchs’ spirals act as environmental pincers that lift the artifact, making setting an active agent rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—“honor overlooked histories”—tighten once when the twin butterfly arrives and claims the wing, forcing Elara to relinquish her creation; the price (loss of tangible memorial) is legible but compressed into a single beat, limiting escalation depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the dissolve-then-flight of the wire-wing constellation, implying memory survives only by letting go; the final image reconfigures earlier motifs without moralizing, though the refrain “histories that dissolve” edges close to echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual filter (“silver wire catching starlight”); rhythmic compression mirrors her hammering heart without syntactic monotony, and no head-hop occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high but patterned (knot, wing, wire, cloud) and pays off at closure; one paraphrase loop (“blushing stillness” repeated) and a filter-verb cluster mid-scene prevent a cleaner 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The monarch-migration memorial is a fresh synthesis; the wire-cathedral lifted by living butterflies transforms eco-lyric into conceptual sculpture, and the risk of total ephemerality heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
