<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to hurl the prism reconfigures the town’s windows and seals her renunciation of solitary hoarding. The scar-as-constellation beat crystallizes contradictory impulses—self-wounding yet self-mapping—under pressure. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the earned stasis (accepting future cracks) carries visible cost. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s dispersal heals the town’s mundane fractures, reweighting Mara’s private craft into public gift. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each ringed memory tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the prism itself and the implicit acceptance of future storms. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered with salt-wind, kelp, rust, and pier-post drip—selective sensory hierarchy filtered through Mara’s glazier eye. The prism-as-micro-setting constrains her final choice: its facets dictate the sevenfold light-path that seals the town’s windows. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Weather and tide act as temporal pressure, tightening the pre-sunrise window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—illuminate value before sunrise—is signaled early and tightened by each expanding ring. Agency is exercised in the decisive throw; the cost is the prism’s loss and the acceptance of inevitable future cracks. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the quiet radiance of chipped, dented, scarred things. Subtext operates in the silent prism-flare and the bay’s humming harmonic. Final image of sealed windows reframes prior relics without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity lingers—next storm will come—yet the reweighting is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, salt-tinged, and glazier-specific: “storms slid off them like apologies.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell—short declaratives at climax. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Patterned elision (ledger entries written by the night) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “latent auroral residue still folded in the upper atmosphere.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long cadence for dawn hush, staccato for prism throw. Information density high; every sentence advances image or stakes. Zero artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—harbor glazier who reads light-debts in tide-rings—is fresh and non-obvious. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, proving specificity. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the seven-blade healing. No close echoes; synthesis feels inevitable. Bold structural choice (single accumulative shard) heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
