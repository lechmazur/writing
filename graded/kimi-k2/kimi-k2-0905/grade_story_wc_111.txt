<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara emerges as believably weathered and quietly contradictory; the interior tug-of-war between needing control and surrendering to the garden gives her nuance. The final choice—accepting servant-hood while wearing the waiting glove—feels like the earned endpoint of four decades of embodied doubt. Emotional cost is legible in the moment she bites the impossible apple and again in the raised-hand farewell. Still, one too many neat summary strings ("teaching them to dream of rain") dampen immediacy at key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure satisfies with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze parts not as escape but as new room in a house that was already hers. Cost surfaces in the glove’s ancient fit and the apple’s compressed seasons—gifts that cannot be replicated tomorrow. Under Accumulative/Textural drive, the story deepens pattern more than plot, ending in Charged Poise rather than decisive action. Slight causality stutter lingers at the moment the maze first realigns; the hedges’ "immediate" response reads as situational magic rather than motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Space is sharply tactile: soil-crust under fingernails, spider-silk cloth catching dawn. The glove and apple function as micro-setting anchors physically constraining Elara’s final choices. Sensory detail is selective; we feel temperature and texture precisely when stakes crystallize. One mild echo (“withered” repeats in vine dresser and rose arbor) knocks it short of 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden mastery vs servant surrender) is signaled early and tightened by the 0.03% luck score. Mid-story apple delivery functions as deepening rather than resolution—it doubles the pressure to accept or resist complicity. Agency is decisional, not combative: she chooses to embrace servitude with visible cost. Co-incidence serves only as catalyst; the apple does not resolve the core conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around reciprocity and the quiet dignity of tending the untendable. Motifs return organically—cracked glass becomes not ornament but aperture for light—so the garden’s final parting reads as reconfiguration rather than exposition. No bald moral intrudes. One line tilts dangerously close to thematic statement (“demonstrating its understanding of probability transcended human mathematics”), nudging the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Free indirect style is clean, sustained, and selective; the prose hears the world through Elara’s weathered attention. Non-standard rhythms (“maze walls parted to reveal...”) serve breath rather than flourish. No head-hopping or register drift interrupts the single POV. Only occasional lyrical surfeit softens immediacy for a hairline moment mid-climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is largely variegated; information density is high without artifact churn. One loop—“commemorated elaborately” reappears twice within four lines—flirts with redundancy. Sentences accelerate under pressure where needed, then drop into quiet hush at the closing gate. Micro-moves (hedges shifting “slightly”) read as intentional cadence rather than slack scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The premise (probability scoring meets sentient garden) is fresh yet grounded in the familiar trope of co-dominance between gardener and green. Specificity in cracked marbles, spider-silk cloth, and the impossible apple keeps the world from generic fantasy. One risk: lyric phrasing occasionally flirts with familiar ecological reverence. Overall, the synthesis feels new, risky, and inevitable rather than gimmick.</comment>
