<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her cracked marbles, withered hands, and the glove that “fit her withered hand perfectly” anchor her contradictions. The central flaw (belief in mastery vs. servitude) is dramatized through micro-choices: placing marbles, biting the apple, accepting the glove. The final stance—renunciation of control with visible cost—earns its resonance because every beat has shown her tending the garden’s language. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s gift of the impossible apple and the ancient glove crystallize the partnership and foreclose any illusion of control. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each marble memory and seasonal taste layer density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is unmistakable: the 0.03% luck score and the literal withering of her body. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (fountain, grove, gate) remain coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden maze is not backdrop but active agent: hedges “shifted slightly,” walls “parted,” branches “lowered themselves.” Micro-setting (marbles, glove, apple) constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—moonlight on wisteria, “perfect sweetness” of compressed seasons—filtered through Elara’s lifelong priorities. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “living labyrinth” edges toward the poetic-generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who tends whom—tightens through the apple beat: the garden’s impossible fruit forces Elara to relinquish mastery. Agency is renunciation, cost is the irreversible knowledge that her decades of control were reciprocal servitude. Pressure escalates via the measurable-luck conceit (0.03%) and the garden’s immediate, unasked response. No coincidence resolves; the grove is prepared long before her arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: cracked marbles, moonlit wisteria, drought-dreaming tomatoes. The final image—glove holding marbles—offers a non-literal answer: broken things, cherished, become maps. No moralizing; the garden’s knowledge of her name is felt, not stated. Subtext hums in every leaf-rustle and soil-scented silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “soil-borne secrets,” “constellation of broken memories.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s aged patience—long sentences for reflection, sudden fragments under wonder. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“all compressed into perfect sweetness”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is absent by design; interior monologue carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “forgotten promises,” “impossible vitality.” Rhythm breathes with scene needs—slow polish, sharp bite. No mixed metaphors or register drift. High information density: “garden believed she was its master” condenses forty years of negotiation into eight words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The measurable-luck conceit is fresh yet fully integrated; the garden’s rejection of arithmetic feels inevitable. Transformation test passed: swap names or climate and the emotional arc collapses. Specificity anchors universals—moonlit wisteria, spider-silk cloth. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible.</comment>
