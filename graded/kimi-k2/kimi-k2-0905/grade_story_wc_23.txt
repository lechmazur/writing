<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is richly embodied (“copper wiring of her throat”) and motives deepen through tactile micro-choices (soldering hair, stepping into spiral). Final renunciation—becoming the place others will navigate—earns its cost via prior causal chain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station lifts as idea, folding grief into reclaimed geography. Causal lens holds—each call tightens options until the spiral closes with visible price (her body dissolving to cedar-scented dust).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signal station, censer foot, and moonlit dish constrain every move; spatial choreography is precise (“boots between bronze foot and metal veins”). Final image—white flowers opening only in starlight—recharges setting as living memorial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reverse migration to reclaim lost geography) escalates via each cryptic call, narrowing choices until protagonist pays with self-dissolution. Cost is visceral and irreversible, felt in the crumbling censer foot and sprouting flowers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete reversals: migration undone by memory, loss translated into geography. Final image of flowers that bloom only in starlight offers non-literal answer—raw solace without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“moonlight moved it, a fraction each night, the way sorrow shifts”). Patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping, perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image, memory, and motion. Metaphors interlock without muddle; rhythm accelerates under pressure. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: starlit signal station as psychic lighthouse, reverse migration as literal reclamation of land via memory. Risky lyric structure pays off; premise transformed through specific lived detail.</comment>
