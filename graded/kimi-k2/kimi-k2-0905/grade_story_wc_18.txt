<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mirror-maker’s contradictory impulses—capture versus release—are dramatized in the final orchard beat; the renunciation costs him his original craft purpose, felt in the lighter-pocket/heavier-heart image. Interiority stays concrete, anchored to frost, fog, and brass. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible absent by scope. Flaw drives mistake: erasing boundaries traps him inside one; recognition lands with embodied chill.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: he dismantles the capture device, foreclosing the dream-trade forever; cost is the loss of his former mirrors’ power, legible in “his pockets lighter… heavier by understanding.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mirrored/frost images tightens until the final scatter of shards reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props. One causal micro-turn: hesitation under threat of limitation triggers dismantling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fog-slick orchard, broken sextant, and frost function as micro-setting that constrains footing, breathing rhythm, and ultimately the decision to scatter shards. Selective sensory triage—metallic breath, powdered-glass frost—mirrors internal state without cataloging. Spatial choreography clean: four trees form chamber, shards track to earth. Weather evolves from twilight frost to dream-snow, charging final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover runaway dream—tightens when capture threatens to imprison infinity; pressure peaks at “form meant limitation.” One meaningful deepening: dream’s reflective reply reweights stakes from acquisition to release. Agency visible in deliberate dismantling; cost is permanent loss of mirror magic. Coincidence absent; escalation purely internal yet legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: boundary-drawing as self-imprisonment. Final image of orchard humming glass-mountains reconfigures earlier ruin into living prism without moralizing. No abstract labels; insight crystallizes through action. Subtext in scattered shards-as-seeds implies generative surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature metallic, reflective, frost-bitten. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breathing cadence, teaching patterned elision early. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Diction stays within artisan-astronomer lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with orchard respiration; sentence variety supports momentum. High density: “frost to momentary diamonds” does image + cost in five words. One paraphrase loop faint (“between what is and what might be” echoed) but does not touch closure. Metaphors consistent—glass, frost, starlight—no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—mirror-maker hunting escaped dream—feels fresh; sextant-as-lens-for-possibility is specific invention. Transformation test fails if relocated: fog-orchard, shard-seeds, and breathing sync are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off with resonant closure. No derivative echoes; archetype of craftsman is subverted by refusal to trap infinity.</comment>
