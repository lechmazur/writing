<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locksmith’s interior contradiction—his own fear once sewn shut—surfaces only in the final beat; until then he is a cipher whose motives are asserted (“asked no payment except a lock of hair”) rather than dramatized under pressure. The single micro-choice—offering his forehead to the trembling mouth—earns the closure, but the absence of any earlier visible flaw or cost keeps the arc just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver curl tucked behind his ear reweights every prior lock opened and makes the cost of bearing freed secrets audible. The accumulative lens is taught by the repeating hair/ribbon motif and holds without contradiction; the final image crystallizes options while the deer-of-light runs on, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nexus breathes and folds only when the sky “forgot its colors,” a rule learned through action; the ribbon’s shift from midnight-blue to empty wrist to silver curl tracks spatially and charges the final image. Sensory selection stays inside the locksmith’s twilight vigil—starlight braiding hair, scent of longing—so environment, body, and tool constrain every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the idea of peace from fear—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the mouth sewn shut refuses to open; the locksmith’s backward step disorients dread itself, a single meaningful escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: he takes his own ancient fear back onto his body, ribbon now circling his wrist and silver curl behind his ear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterated image of hair-as-key: every lock once opened becomes part of the opener, so liberation is never external but carried. The final anti-map drawn in negative space reweights the premise without moralizing—freedom is a path defined by where no one has yet stepped—and the deer-of-light leaves glowing hoofprints in the reader’s mind rather than a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the locksmith’s perceptual signature—starlight braiding hair, scent of “improbable longing”—and modulates rhythm from long incantatory sentences to the clipped final laugh. No head-hopping; patterned elision (“sang—not with voice, but with silence shaped into resonance”) is taught early and paid off when the mouth sighs wind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—each sentence advances image or stakes—but occasional modifier stacks (“an imagining so fragile it had been hidden even from itself”) flirt with overwriting without muddling causality. Zero loops, clean grammar, and the final crystalline image prevent any artifact from touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cosmic locksmith + hair-key + fear-vault feels inevitable yet unseen before; the backward step that disorients dread itself is a fresh tactical inversion. Risk-taking—lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals—heightens coherence and pays off in the silver-curl self-return, a symmetry that reconfigures the entire myth without gimmickry.</comment>
