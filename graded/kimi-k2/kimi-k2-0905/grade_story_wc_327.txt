<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller’s fear-of-silence motive is vivid and embodied; her calcifying sacrifice is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete (“skin into drum”) and contradictory impulses (fear of curse vs fear of silence) act simultaneously. The final renunciation—one life for many voices—carries visible cost scaled to the length. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-awareness; voice remains singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s palm releases the language forever, a Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each echo layers density until the final crystallization. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“canyon wall”) and never drifts. No causal breaks; every beat (“swallowed the diamond”) tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes, bone towers, and flawed diamond function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the spiral artery literally shapes footstep-to-voice translation. Sensory specificity (“taste the lost language’s grammar of textures”) is selective and POV-filtered. Environmental details evolve with the curse—ivory skin, crystal heart—charging the final image. No static repetition; each echo reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the river-tongue or accept silence—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates through texture-to-sound translation. One decisive tightening: swallowing the diamond calcifies her body while releasing the language. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is visceral (heart slows to fossil tempo) and scales to the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living tissue that outlives any single body. Subtext operates in gesture—her open palm at the end is both surrender and transmission. No moralizing; the final image of travelers carrying “sand-dune consonants” reweights the premise without statement. Complexity is preserved: curse and gift are indistinguishable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric close-third stays consistent; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic (“tongue over unglazed pottery”). Syntax mirrors the spiral descent—long sentences coil, then fracture into phonemes. No register drift; diction remains within storyteller’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or texture. Figurative language is precise (“her copper veins like loose wires”) and never muddles causality. Rhythm accelerates with heartbeat meter, then calcifies into stasis. No mixed metaphors; physical logic holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—translating texture into sound via bodily sacrifice—is non-obvious and fully committed. Synthesis of bird-flight patterning, bone-flute acoustics, and linguistic preservation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky second-person invitation at the end pays off by extending the language beyond the page. No derivative templates; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
