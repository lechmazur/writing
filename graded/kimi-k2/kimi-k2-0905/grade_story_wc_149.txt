<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ghost bride’s contradictory impulses—loving mercy and lethal poison—are embodied in every beat; her final dissolution into river-salt carries the cost of centuries-old guilt. The boy’s arc from captive to chosen is cleanly motivated by the bead’s heat and her touch. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the boy’s voice lacks full individuation, keeping this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s sinking reweights the lineage’s fate and dissolves the ghost, a felt cost under the Causal lens. Every beat follows because/therefore logic; no teleporting props or retro-patching. The mosaic of shards is taught early and resolves to one coherent image. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s blue-glowing sludge and mercury rain constrain every grafting cut; the frozen river becomes the final tool that drowns the tumor. Details are selective, filtered through the boy’s apothecary-trained eye. Spatial choreography is flawless. The orchard’s endless night charges the closing dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the boy before the tumor is harvested—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened each time the bead pulses hotter. The ghost’s debt escalates the pressure; the masters’ scalpels raise it further. The final choice to drown the seed forecloses the orchard’s future with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spiral bead and poisoned fruit: mercy and murder are the same vine. Subtext lives in the boy learning the “lovingly venomous” craft from the woman who once killed his line. The ending offers no moral—only the image of a saved boy and a dark greenhouse that will never bloom again.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, each sentence sculpted to the ghost’s mournful cadence and the boy’s sharper, thinner diction. Compression and elision are taught early (“ephemeral cameo”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV distance stays controlled. The river’s black water and the bead’s spiral echo in rhythm and image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent—moon-dust, mercury rain, grafting whip. No loops, no scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“alchemical orchard greenhouse”) is earned by the apothecary world. Final line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The ghost-bride-as-debt-collector and tumor-as-poisoned-fruit synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. The orchard’s endless night and the bead’s spiral are particular inventions, not tropes. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic shards) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The lineage-saving twist reconfigures the original murder into absolution.</comment>
