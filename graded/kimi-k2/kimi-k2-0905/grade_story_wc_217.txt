<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is embodied in micro-choices—tucking the feather, tuning the string, drawing the spiral—each revealing his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (letting the spiral dissolve) is earned by the prior accumulation of attention and carries visible cost. The woman remains functional rather than individuated, but the poet’s contradiction between completion and acceptance is dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral dissolves yet the chord persists, reconfiguring meaning without tidy resolution. Causality is accumulative/textural—each fragment gathered intensifies the final resonance. The Orientation Test is met within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, wet sand, and driftwood log constrain movement and supply materials for the spiral. The drake feather and broken zither function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the poet’s attention; weather and tide actively shape the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and tightened through each gathered shard. The spiral’s dissolution is the single meaningful deepening that forecloses completion as a goal. Cost is felt in the poet’s relinquishment of finished form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between fracture and harmony; no explicit statement intrudes. The final image—“Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the feather’s transfer and the kite’s re-braided tail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is the poet’s synesthetic attention (“burnished hush,” “syllables were tiny mirrors”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under the gull’s cry, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports the tidal rhythm; figurative language is controlled and never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—collaborative tending of fracture through art—feels fresh in its refusal of resolution. Specific details (torn feather, cracked zither, plastic soldier) transform familiar shoreline tropes. The synthesis of sound, image, and silence is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
