<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambrose’s lifelong compulsion to archive is embodied in every gesture; the wax shaving forces a micro-choice that re-weights his vow. Interior contradiction—archive vs. silence—plays out in real time, culminating in the Earned Stasis of accepting the foghorn inside him. Cost is palpable: he forfeits solitude and becomes the city’s grief vessel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the foghorn migrates into Ambrose, reconfiguring the premise from “sound dies” to “sound migrates.” Causal chain (wax → memory → acceptance) is tight; the 1958 flashback is anchored to present stimuli and tilts the final stance. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is no backdrop; the Judean date palm and quince ink literally host the prophecy, constraining the final act of inscription. Micro-setting (wax basin, greenhouse glass) charges the closing image of velvet disquiet. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful; every leaf and fruit carries mnemonic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to silence or embody the city’s grief—tightens when the shaving dissolves and the prophecy names him. One decisive deepening: immersion redefines options from containment to surrender. Cost is visible on the page as he presses forehead to bark and awaits the first knock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of archiving the unarchivable: vows become living burdens. The Hittite verb “to remain” reweights every prior oath without moralizing. Final image of velvet disquiet offers non-literal resonance—grief as atmospheric residue—earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is archaic, tactile, and precise—“quince-juice ink,” “xylem like a lullaby”—yet never purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: Ambrose hears languages the way others hear music. No head-hopping; compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths in the orchard, staccato when the shaving dissolves. Figurative language is sparse, accurate, and never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—dead language prophecy born from child-cranked phonograph—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test: could not swap out Hittite, wax, or foghorn without collapsing the story. Risky lyric structure pays off; the city’s grief migrating into a single scribe feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
