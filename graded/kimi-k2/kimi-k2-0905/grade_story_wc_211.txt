<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambrose’s interior contradiction—archivist of promises now forced to become the living archive—drives every beat; the 1958 memory flash cements motive and fear. Embodied reactions (knees tilt, cheeks burn) keep emotion off-label. Final endurance costs him identity: “neither alive nor dead, only remaining” lands as earned stasis. Only minor slip: quince-ink stylus appears late without prior cue, slightly blurring tool-use continuity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (wax shaving, water basin, ledger) layers density until the closing transmutation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Ambrose’s voice becomes the foghorn—felt cost legible in “soft velvet disquiet.” Causality is lyric but coherent: immerse → dissolve → migrate. Orientation anchors (Pier 39, rooftop orchard, 1958 Sacramento) arrive before 120-word mark; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop orchard functions as micro-setting: drip-fed stone basin, quince-ink distillery, 2,000-year palm seed constrain Ambrose’s ritual choices. Foghorn silence migrates into his body, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile—wax warmth, subsonic hum—matching archivist’s ear-centric vocation. Spatial choreography clean; no floating greenhouse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—archive or be archived—tightens when wax speaks Hittite, forcing immersion choice that dissolves the artifact into him. One meaningful deepening: childhood memory reveals he’s always been the vessel, narrowing options from record to embody. Cost visible: “soft velvet disquiet” drapes city rooftops, his pulse now their unresolved chord. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory and promise are not stored but suffered. Motif “to remain” mutates from archival ideal to existential curse via fruit-faces and ledger braille. Final image reweights premise—silence becomes substance—without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: pressing forehead to 2,000-year seed conveys surrender more than exposition ever could.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings to Ambrose’s antiquarian sensorium: “wax was once his ink” compresses vocation and nostalgia in five words. Rhythm swells with long sentences then fractures at climax—“the orchard tilt under his knees” mirroring vertigo. No head-hopping; phonograph children stay external silhouettes. Register stays within scribe’s lexicon; Hittite verb feels discovered, not shown off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud cadence varies; paragraph lengths breathe with revelation beats. Figurative language dense but patterned (sound → memory → plant vasculature) so closure remains clear. No synonym loops; “wax shaving” recurs with new charge each time. Minor scaffold: “He understood” appears twice in quick succession—drops score a hair.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Foghorn migrating into human larynx via children’s field-trip friction is fresh, inevitable in hindsight. Specificities—quince-ink, medlar fruit, 1958 state-fair cylinder—anchor concept in lived texture. Risk of dead-language prophecy pays off because cost is bodily. Could not swap Ambrose with generic archivist without breaking engine.</comment>
