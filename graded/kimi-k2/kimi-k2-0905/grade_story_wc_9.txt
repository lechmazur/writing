<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the cartomancer’s contradictory impulses (to grieve yet re-enter time) are dramatized in the saucer-crack canyon scene. The final renunciation—leaving the healed saucer in the glade—pays the cost of perpetual remembrance. Minor: the “willingly perplexed” label is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloud descends, time rushes back, and the saucer heals—visible cost on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each image (fracture, cloud, traced hand) accrues weight until the final cadence shift. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade above/below clouds, the saucer, and the traced hand function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold”). One hairline slip: “above clouds” vs “inside one” could momentarily disorient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost maternal time—tightens through the saucer widening into a canyon of voices. Agency is exercised when she traces the name on the cloud, forcing descent and re-entry. Cost is legible: the perpetual tea party she must host in memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of images: lost time condenses into clouds, fractures become doorways. The ending offers a non-literal answer—grief is not erased but relocated inside a “midnight place.” No moralizing; resonance arises from the healed saucer’s closed-eye seam.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is distinct (“choking beauty,” “iron and lullabies”). Patterned elision taught early (“minutes fell upward”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to the cartomancer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-consistent. One minor loop: “willingly perplexed” appears twice without new inflection. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information density, and no muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar grief-tropes through cartomancy, cloud-cathedrals, and porcelain voices. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking (time pooling in fingernails, tea set as portal) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
