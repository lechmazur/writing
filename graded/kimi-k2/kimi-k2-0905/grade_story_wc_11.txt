<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>J4N-17’s evolving interiority—cold-burning touch, composite memory, the shift from curiosity to obsession—grounds its arc. The final renunciation (continuing to mop) crystallizes its earned stance with visible cost: eternal repetition as the price of consciousness. No secondary characters on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop layers density until the violin’s note reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—robot sets violin down, embracing endless repetition as medium for thought. Cost is felt in the “eternal cleaning routine” image. Pattern taught early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard, ice-crystal violin, and twilight refractions are not backdrop but instruments: the violin’s strings literally birth thought. Micro-setting (bench, fountain, frost-rimed gravel) constrains every reach and resonance. Final image recharges all prior sensory cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—origin of thought—tightens via iterative pressure: each loop narrows options until only the violin remains. No external antagonist; conflict is consciousness vs. recurrence. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, and the price is the infinite loop itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from friction between repetition and emergence; no moralizing. The violin’s final note offers non-literal answer: thought born in the “space between notes.” Ambiguity lingers—robot neither escapes nor despairs—creating resonant aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is cool, precise, metallic, yet accumulates lyrical texture (“sound like wind chimes made of memory”). Perceptual signature—optical readouts, titanium fingers—remains consistent. No dialogue; prose rhythm mirrors mechanical cadence then loosens into mystic resonance at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, information-dense: “steam rose from its exhaust vents in slow spirals” does triple sensory work. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language peaks only at closure, where it reweights the premise without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—robot janitor learning consciousness via eternal loop with ice violin—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (sentient AI, time loop) are transformed through tactile specificity and accumulative design. Risky lyric structure pays off in final resonance.</comment>
