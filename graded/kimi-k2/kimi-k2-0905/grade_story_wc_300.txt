<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s fear of living rooms and her porous surrender to the cave’s sorrow are embodied in trembling breath and copper roots biting her temples; the crown’s acceptance is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interior contradiction pulses—she inspects tombs yet seeks forgiveness—driving every step. The mother’s cameo supplies motive without overt exposition. No secondary on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the mirror’s reconfiguration crystallizes the collective ache into living light. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s transformation into eternal witness—charged by the pearl’s dissolution and the silhouettes’ communal pulse. Cost is legible: she forfeits the surface world and her own bodily autonomy. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal veins, mineral tears, and the quartz mirror are not backdrop but agents: the calcite answers the pearl, the crown roots into stone, the mirror reconfigures reality. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and sonic—salt-iron air, humming throat—mirroring Mara’s internal resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Setting constrains the final choice and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolving walls between hearts—tightens through each confession absorbed; the pearl’s warming and the crown’s bite mark escalating cost. One meaningful deepening: the moment Mara kneels and speaks her own confession, irrevocably binding her to the cave’s collective sorrow. Agency remains hers; coincidence never rescues. Pressure culminates in the mirror’s rippling reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation of abandoned hopes calcified into stone, culminating in a non-literal answer: the cave’s heart learns to beat again through shared sorrow. No moralizing; resonance is carried by image—the woman imprinted in living light. Subtext operates in the pearl’s silent Morse and the builders’ translucent plea. Final image reweights the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“crystal caves that had been forgotten by every map,” “mineral tears that caught her headlamp and fractured it into rainbows trapped in mid-sob.” Syntax mirrors breath and echo; no head-hopping. Compression taught early—“heartbeat of a hesitation between sirens”—and paid off at closure. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors are coherent—“stalactites hung like frozen chords”—and serve the resonant hush. Minor risk of excess lyricism in “choir of faint chimes,” but cadence supports the climactic beat rather than obscuring it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic bunker inspector with crystal-cave psychopomp feels inevitable yet fresh; the pearl as absolution device and crown as witness tool are non-obvious syntheses. Transformation test passed: story would collapse if names or setting were swapped. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
