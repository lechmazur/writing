<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—terror of living rooms vs duty—grounds every step. The confession beat “I inspect tombs…” lands with embodied cost. Final crown acceptance marks earned renunciation with visible roots in hair. Micro-choices—pearl to wall, tongue to stone—charge through image not therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens clear; each mineral tear and etched line raises sorrow-density until mirror blossoms. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: crown places Mara in perpetual stasis with acknowledged cost—the pearl dissolved forever. Linkages hold; no teleport or reset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal walls—salt, iron, membrane—act as living organ, constraining movement and forcing tactile confession. Mirror chamber functions as micro-setting dictating final posture. Pearl and crown are extensions of the body-as-environment, grounding choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake announced early: dissolve heart-walls. Escalation is density increase of sorrow-light until choice crystallizes—wear crown, remain, pearl forfeit. Cost legible: perpetual tending traded for surface life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of shared grief as living tissue coheres through concrete spiral, mineral tears, root-crown—not thesis—ending crystallizes global heart repaired by listening. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distanced third modulates lyric compression; syntax “hummed like a throat holding back” teaches reader early; final choir of chimes remains legible under accretive lens. No POV drift maintained through to glass silhouette.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with beats—“stalactites hung like frozen chords”—propulsive without overwriting. All metaphors cohere under geological body motif. Only minor stem “the whole cave seemed—” could trim one beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Transforms familiar cave-quest into communal heart-cistern keeper; mythic role feels specific to Mara's flaw, not transferable. Pearl-into-mirror bloom is fresh reprise that retroactively reframes mother’s gift. Risk of permanent stasis taken without safety.</comment>
