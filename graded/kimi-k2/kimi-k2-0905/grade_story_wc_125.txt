<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is textured—ink-stained fingers, the rope’s weight, the need to “discover the texture of time”—but the energy beings remain abstractions, so the external pressure feels conceptual rather than personal. The final refusal is credible, yet the cost is more asserted (“impossible and perfect and mine”) than dramatized in body or relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator walks out still flesh, rope belted, while the beings follow—cost is the weight of perpetual choice. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each image (garden, rope, clay prints) layers until the final stance crystallizes. One scaffold loop (“rough where it broke, smooth where it held”) repeats without new pressure, a minor drag.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto is tactile—warm clay, finger grooves, starlight the color of “dried blood”—and the rope micro-setting constrains the final choice by being literally cinched around the body. Spatial track is clean; no orientation debt. The energy beings’ shimmer is evoked but not anchored to a sensory channel, keeping the piece just shy of 9-band object charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transcend or remain—arrives early; pressure tightens when the narrator handles Marcus’s rope and feels the literal fiber of refusal. Escalation is textural: each recalled loss (Mrs. Chen’s tomatoes, clay prints) adds density until the final footfall renounces weightless eternity. Cost is present but generalized; a sharper concrete forfeiture would push 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope, garden, and starlight: the mortal texture of unfinished choice. No moralizing; the final song is an open circuit. The energy beings’ incomprehension subtly reframes transcendence as erasure, letting ambiguity linger. One near-echo—“impossible choices” repeated—leans toward prompt-language but stays within character reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person lyric is consistent—syntax lengthens and contracts like breath, perceptual bias toward tactile detail (“pulse of something ancient and electric”). No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. Register holds; only “therapy-speak” risk is the phrase “impossible choices,” softened by being the POV’s own poetic shorthand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer image and idea without scaffold. One paraphrase loop noted above; otherwise no filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphor. Rhythm modulates with walking cadence; final line opens outward. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of cosmic transcendence offer with roadside poet’s rope-belted refusal feels fresh; the trope is tilted through tactile mortal detail rather than spectacle. Risk is moderate—quiet ending, lyric accumulation—but coherence holds. Could edge higher with a sharper specific consequence unique to this grotto.</comment>
