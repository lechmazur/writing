<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is textured and embodied—ink-stained fingers, rope-burns on skin—but the final refusal to transcend feels more asserted than earned; no prior beat shows the specific cost of staying flesh. Marcus’s off-stage escape supplies motive texture yet remains a narrative convenience rather than a crucible for the poet’s own choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet walks into starlight still flesh, rope coiled like a question, the energy beings following at a distance—cost is the weight of perpetual choosing. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each image (rope, tomatoes, clay finger-marks) layers density until the final stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto breathes, pulses, and retains Marcus’s finger-dug impressions—setting as active witness. Starlight “the color of dried blood” charges the final image, constraining the poet’s refusal with visceral specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transcend or remain—tightens through sensory accumulation rather than plot reversals; the poet’s agency is the act of bearing witness while walking away. Cost is felt in the rope’s weight and the energy beings’ puzzled trailing, but escalation is more lyrical than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the texture of choice itself: “rough where it broke, smooth where it held.” Final image of walking the unwritten road reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, compressed, tactile (“liquid starlight,” “memory of perfume in an empty room”)—and sustains perceptual signature under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to the poet’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“like heat above summer asphalt”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar alien-offer trope is transformed through tactile specificity and the poet’s refusal to treat transcendence as resolution. Fresh angle: valuing the weight of choice over weightless eternity.</comment>
