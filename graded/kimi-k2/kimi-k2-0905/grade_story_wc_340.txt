<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity is vividly embodied—she polishes the goggles, traces the cipher, hums the staff—so her shift from obedient servant to clandestine planter feels inevitable. The final renunciation (staying below) carries visible cost: she forfeits status, warmth, safety. One hairline slip: the duke’s-son chord is more symbol than crucible; it doesn’t force her hand, merely echoes it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira refuses to ascend again, roots herself in the hothouse; the cost is the life she leaves above. Causal chain holds—goggles → cipher → map → seed → stay—each beat narrows options. No orientation debt; icebound spire, elevator, servant role are anchored by line 3. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brass elevator, frost-lens facets, apricot humidity—every detail is filtered through Lira’s cleaner-eye and constrains action (she can’t open the rusted door without the ash trade). The cracked goggles function as micro-setting, refracting light that literally reorders diary pages. Final image of scattered light “like children chasing geese” recharges the earlier refraction and charges her choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she deliver the seed or report upstairs?—is signaled when she straps the goggles on. Mid-story tightening: the gust re-sorts pages, clicking the diary lock shut unless she acts now. Cost is legible: she trades thimble, risks dismissal, buries herself in sub-zero basement. One minor slack: the piano chord complicates mood but not tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—joy smuggled into sorrow’s fortress—emerges through apricot vs. winter, seed vs. spire, without sermon. The laughing mouth water-stain reappears as spiral staff, reconfiguring grief into music, then into growth. Final image of “roots and branches alike” offers non-literal answer: expansion, not escape. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Lira’s perceptual signature—bergamot ghost, brass cold, coal-ash warmth. Syntax flexes with pressure: long breathless clauses in elevator, staccato trades in descent, lyrical uplift in hothouse. No head-hopping; piano boy’s interior is only inferred through music falter. Distinctive diction throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “snow drifted…like a soft apology” does double descriptive-emotional work. One micro-loop: “pages had blown everywhere; she gathered them” could compress, but it’s followed by immediate pattern payoff. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays physical (metal taste, furnace lungs). Clean grammar, varied rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen-airship + underground-orchard synthesis feels fresh yet inevitable; apricot seed as joy-smuggler reframes steampunk fatalism. Encrypted diary decoded by refracted light is a novel mechanic, not gimmick, because it forces page reordering and map discovery. Risk-taking (ten-floor descent in <800 words) tightens rather than fragments. No derivative-premise penalty.</comment>
