<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arlo’s contradictory impulses—taxed dreams vs. subversive planting—are dramatized in real time; the final smile and sprint crystallize his rogue stance with visible cost. Interiority is specific, embodied, and consistent. Minor slip: Inspector Voss remains a cipher, so relationship crucible is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted seed becomes a city-wide flowering “Resist,” reweighting reality with conceptual cost. Causal chain (seed → warp → glyph → dawn bloom) holds under a Causal lens. One transition (greenhouse to alley sprint) is legible. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass, orchid bees, and moonlit soil constrain every move; the seed-as-micro-setting literally rewrites reality. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean; drone lens and footsteps track believably.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guard the spark before the Bureau snuffs it—tightens when Voss appears and the satellite clock looms. Agency drives escalation: Arlo plants, recites Lucretius, sprints. Cost is felt in taxed thoughts and risk of capture. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of taxed imagination vs. subversive creativity emerges through concrete acts, not statement. Final flowering “Resist” offers non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext in vegetal code and pollen clouds deepens without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors,” “nectar and nerves.” Syntax and diction mirror Arlo’s rogue-scholar mind. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Dialogue sparse but coded and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor register drift (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. Final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: taxable thoughts + vegetal code + community-garden insurgency feels inevitable yet new. Tropes (rogue scholar, surveillance dystopia) are transformed through sensory specificity and lived stakes. Risk-taking (warp grammar) heightens coherence.</comment>
