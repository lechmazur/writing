<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—gears, creel, ribbon all externalize motive—but the librarian’s contradictory impulses (preserve vs release) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ribbon wound round the creel, the promise to “routine you into stars,” and the hollow in her chest reconfigure stakes with felt absence; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atrium’s tidal rise, brass roots knitting archive to seabed, and moonlit skylight actively constrain her choices; the bamboo creel as micro-setting charges the final image when it drinks memories and expands one ring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder without caging identity—tightens when moon pulls contradictions outward; smelting identities into ribbon is the decisive act that forecloses easy separation, paid for by her own looming erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: identity as migratory flux, wonder sustained only in motion; final whispered promise and expanding creel reweight premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, metallic yet tender; perceptual signature filters every image through brass, salt, moon-phase mesh; rhythmic control tightens under pressure, no head-hopping, consistent lyric distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, propulsive; figurative layering is disciplined, no mixed metaphors or loops; “salt settled on brass like frost that had never heard of cold” exemplifies precision without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of steampunk librarian, lunar tidal archive, and migratory souls feels inevitable; no stock tropes, every image particular; risk in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
