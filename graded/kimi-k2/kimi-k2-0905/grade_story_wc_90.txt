<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Halcyon’s pacifism is embodied in every micro-choice—threading photos with her own hair, refusing hologram warnings—culminating in the costly renunciation of escape. The contradiction between joy and grief is dramatized in scene, not summarized. Her final Earned Stasis (choosing to stay and tend the archive) is fully earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the hatch seals behind her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship becomes seed rather than coffin, the dimension opens, and Halcyon’s stance crystallizes with undeniable cost. Causal linkage holds throughout—because she stitches joy into the sail, therefore the ship lightens and breaches the bruise. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Lens is Causal and remains stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The recycled hull, gravity spinner, and drifting garden are not backdrop but active constraints: the spinner responds to emotion, the hull must bloom to root. Micro-settings (engine shrine, photograph sail) are tactile and bias-filtered. Final image of vines of light growing from the hull recharges the setting as living archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension with joy heavy enough to counterbalance ten billion deaths—is signaled early and tightened by each beat. The sail’s completion and Halcyon’s fusion with Kwan Yin’s sorrow create the decisive intensification. Cost is legible: she forfeits return, seals the hatch, chooses permanent stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-as-mirror emerges from concrete acts: stitching ghosts, dissolving the Tear into upward rain. No explicit moralizing; the final image of lantern-seed reweights the premise. Subtext in hologram warnings (“the door you open may not be mercy”) is paid off by Halcyon’s lived answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Distinct perceptual signature: “gravitationally lighter when happy,” “hull plates singing.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Halcyon. Compression taught early (“ribs of a dozen dead cruisers”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Figurative language is patterned and purposeful—e.g., “needle through silk.” No mixed metaphors. High information density without clutter. Final line’s “quiet lantern rather than a final bomb” crystallizes earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist after humanity’s end, recycled ship as living seed, joy-as-gravity engine. Tropes transformed through grounded specifics (hair-thread sail, Tear dissolving upward). Risky lyric structure remains legible under Causal lens. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
