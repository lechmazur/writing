<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon’s pacifism is not a label but a lived, embodied practice: every micro-choice—humming while alone, stitching photographs with hair-thread, refusing to flinch at the corridor of accusatory faces—externalizes an internally consistent moral physics. The contradiction between solitary joy and collective grief is held in scene, not alternated in summary, and the final renunciation (stay, tend, never leave) costs her the last human future, a price rendered in the dissolving Tear and rooting ship. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into diagnostic speak; even “shadow work” is handled as tactile labor. The only limit keeping this from 9+ is that no second on-page character pressures her stance in real time; the hologram mothers warn but cannot impose consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship roots, the hatch seals, Halcyon chooses an eternity of service—cost paid on-page (“she had come to stay”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: emotional density (photograph sail, upward rain, blooming vines) reweights the stake from solitary survival to archival guardianship. Causality is lyric but traceable—happiness literally lightens the hull, permitting dimensional transit—so the final rooted stasis is the logical inversion of that buoyancy. No orientation debt; who/where/when is clear by line 5 and reinforced each shard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled hull, gravity spinner, and photograph sail are not backdrop but tools that constrain tactics: only emotional mass can open the bruise, only hair-filament can hold the sail, only a salvaged centrifuge can serve as shrine. Sensory triage is POV-driven—what Halcyon notices is what soothes her (bare feet on deck plates, warmth of jade, vinegar scent of old paper). Spatial choreography is immaculate: every object’s position tracks across the beats (Tear migrates from palm to sail-center to dissolving rain). Environment charges the final image as the ship literalizes into a lantern-garden, making setting inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension or remain exiled—tightens once, photograph by photograph, until joy outweighs ten billion deaths. The tightening is irreversible: once the sail is raised and the Tear dissolved, the corridor opens and the hatch begins to seal, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible on-page (vacuum tugs at her heels; she accepts permanent exile). Under Accumulative lens the pressure is emotional density, not external antagonist, satisfying the single-deepening requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the moral calculus of memory: a species that chose extinction can still opt for posthumous mercy by becoming an archive. No character states this; it is performed through the sail, the rooting ship, the upward rain. Subtext hums in the lullaby no child will hear—an unspoken indictment and benediction in one. Final image of drifting lantern-garden offers a non-literal answer: redemption is not survival but stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays latched to Halcyon’s perceptual filter—gravitational lightness, photograph vinegar, deck-plate chill—without ever ventriloquizing omniscience. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath: long anaphoric cadences when she sews, fragment shards at dimensional threshold. Patterned elision (“mouths moving in silent warnings”) is taught early and paid off at the corridor of whispers. No head-hop, no register drift; even the goddess reference stays within her cultural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate music: sentence variety, paragraph breath, no scaffold loops. Metaphors are coherent—ship as seed, gravity as sorrow—never mixed. High density without purple: “hull plates singing” does double sensorial work. One hairline slip: “watering the recycled hull until it bloomed with vines of light” risks faint cliché bloom, but the inversion of rain falling upward rescues it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses space opera wreckage with Buddhist-inflected shadow work and emotional physics; the synthesis feels inevitable, not grafted. Risk is maximal—no antagonist, no dialogue, no Earth—but coherence never frays. The photograph-as-sail, Tear-as-seed, ship-as-lantern sequence transforms familiar salvage-yard imagery into post-human grace. Transformation test fails if names change: only this pacifist, this goddess relic, this gravitational happiness could produce this ending.</comment>
