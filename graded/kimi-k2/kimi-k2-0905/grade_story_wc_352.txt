<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ilyra’s prism-minded perception and thirty-year obsession are concrete, but her final “third option” feels abstract rather than a visible choice; the interior contradiction is present yet never embodied in a micro-action that costs her something tangible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inverted-gravity hour is a taught pattern that cleanly gates the threshold effects; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when she becomes the living archive, but the cost is more stated than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto’s mist, violet fungi, and living-calculation walls are vivid and selective; the ceiling-become-doorway physically constrains her ascent, charging the final image of spirals carved everywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—locating forgotten combinations—tightens once gravity inverts and the doodle locks; pressure escalates via the grotto’s revelation, but the protagonist’s agency in the final absorption is more surrender than decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through the grotto’s feeding on forgetting; the final reconfiguration—she becomes the catalogued absence—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Voice is consistently lyric and prism-fractured; perceptual signature (“fracturing the violet light into constituent truths”) is distinct and sustained, with purposeful compression that never head-hops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“tasted of iron and old promises,” “seeds of vigilance took root”) risk overwriting; no loops or scaffolding, rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Living archive that inverts gravity to feed on forgetting is a fresh synthesis; the spirals-doodle motif transforms from sketch to lock to eternal inscription, feeling inevitable yet non-derivative.</comment>
