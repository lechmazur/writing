<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her ritual with the crocodile tooth and the “modestly fearless” heartbeat anchor her motives. The micro-choice to press the tooth against the harp string crystallizes her values and carries a felt cost (the child’s laughter entering her ribs). Minor slip: “modestly fearless” is label-adjacent but is immediately embodied in her silent stance under the gorge’s pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV arc; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gorge exhales, confessions soften) with visible cost (Elara’s palm dissolves into salt water). Causal linkage: because she risks contact with the harp, the giggle re-integrates. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is not backdrop but active throat—its breathing, its confessions, its warped harp—constraining every move. The crocodile tooth and harp string function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and urgent; no static catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: integrate the child’s giggle or leave it forever fractured. Pressure tightens when the giggle flees the harp; Elara’s agency (climbing, touching string) forces the decisive re-integration. Cost is palpable—her palm burns with salt and pine. No coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: healing requires letting the wound sing its wrong notes. Subtext lives in gesture—the tooth against the string, the gorge leaning in. Final image of footprints glowing with “luminous ache” reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “quiet metronome against the ribs of dawn,” “throat of stone,” “sour chords that bent memories.” POV remains stable and embodied; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (“she spoke—not with voice…”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High-density, propulsive prose; every sentence layers image, action, or consequence. Metaphors are precise and mutually reinforcing; no mixed vehicles. Minor filter-verb in “she felt the tooth’s faint pulse” is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: soul-collector who gathers laughter-splinters via crocodile-tooth talisman in a gorge that digests confessions. The harp as memory-warping instrument is non-obvious and fully integrated. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
