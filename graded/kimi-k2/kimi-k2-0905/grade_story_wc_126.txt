<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—honoring tradition yet refusing its finality—drive every micro-choice; the seed-planting, wire-bridge, and deliberate non-resolution all arise from her need to “unbind” the bowl from silence. Interiority is embodied in soot-smudged fingertips and the tremor she feels through soil, not labels. The cost—abandoning the bowl and the finished note—feels earned because her earlier refusal to resolve melodies foreshadows this renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the greenhouse keeps “breathing unfinished music,” reconfiguring the family tradition from bonfire spectacle to solitary invitation. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each withheld cadence tightens the thematic stake until the final image crystallizes the cost—Mara walks away having traded communal catharsis for uncertain genesis. The lens holds cleanly from first withheld harmonic to last unfurling leaf.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are not backdrop; the cracked trunks release “memories of blossom and monsoon,” and the drowned bell answers in percussion, constraining Mara’s choice of an underwater root-path for the seed. Micro-setting (the bowl-turned-resonator) literally shapes the final music. Every sensory detail is filtered through her acoustic bias, making the environment an active collaborator.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in the unfinished—escalates via deliberate non-resolution of each musical phrase; the chronic hush tightens as the orchard exhales and the bell clinks, forcing Mara to renounce closure itself. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; the cost is the solitude of an endless cadence. One meaningful deepening suffices and is felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: the refusal to finish a note becomes an ethical stance against consumption and finality. Subtext resides in the bowl’s migration from coin-collector to seed-bed to resonator—each transformation wordless yet legible. The ending offers no moral, only the “vast, simple magnificence” of an unanswered question now rooted in living tissue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s acoustic synesthesia; condensation drips are “minor sevenths begging resolution.” Syntax stretches and suspends like the unresolved cadences she plays. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter; every metaphor is tuned to her perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerated: “the chronic hush answered, widening like a held breath” compresses atmosphere, stakes, and bodily sensation into one clause. Rhythm accelerates during bow strokes, then breathes in deliberate caesuras. No loops, no mixed metaphors; even the ash-slick mud is precise and tactile.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic orchard, shipwreck amphitheater, and acoustic ritual feels inevitable, not contrived. The “unresolved cadence” trope is inverted: instead of tension-release, tension-root. Specificity—scorched mango pits, frayed rigging wire bridge—anchors the surreal frame in lived consequence. Risk is taken and paid off.</comment>
