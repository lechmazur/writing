<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marek’s guilt, pride, and need for atonement are embodied in tactile fidgeting and micro-choices (righting the fallen king). The lone-king stitch pattern externalizes his self-blame and offers a credible path to self-forgiveness. The final pocketing of the king crystallizes earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marek’s act of setting the king upright re-animates the village and reframes his exile. Causal linkage is tight—every decoded stitch foreshadows the acceptance move—and the cost (perpetual unborn storm becoming real thunder) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry border are not backdrop; they constrain movement and mirror Marek’s psyche. The labyrinth’s corridors literally map his regret folds, and the tapestry threads provide the tactical code that unlocks the ending. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each decoded move; the suicidal king sequence escalates the internal cost. The final walk through the physical maze is a decisive narrowing of options that forecloses endless rumination. Agency is clear, and the thunder’s arrival externalizes the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness is not forgetting but reconfiguring the game so loss instructs. The tapestry’s suicidal king, the labyrinth mirror, and the resurrected village all reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image—“the board is wider than the mistake”—resonates non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marek’s perceptual signature; syntax tightens under pressure (“fierce repose of tournament halls”). No head-hopping; every observed detail is filtered through chess logic. Voice modulation tracks emotional intensity without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “woven hush lay over every cobblestone like thick felt” does triple sensory work. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler. Sentence rhythm mirrors the staccato of chess notation and the hush of frozen time. Artifacts zero.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusing chess notation, embroidery, and suspended-time fantasy yields a fresh synthesis. The suicidal king gambit as embroidered penance is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the thunder release. No derivative templates.</comment>
