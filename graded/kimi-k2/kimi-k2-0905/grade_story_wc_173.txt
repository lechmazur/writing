<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lys’s interiority is rich—her chaste status, stolen memories, and bodily poetic all collide in the final renunciation. The contract burning in ash and her barefoot blood-dew prints crystallize a credible, costly shift from commodity to conduit. Minor drift: “alarming serenity” is repeated rather than deepened. Still, the earned stasis feels lived-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s mirror-darkness reweights every prior echo and role. Causal chain—knotting stolen memories → unlocking core → scattering echoes—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; the courtyard and sanctuary anchor by line 3. Persistent cost: her chastity becomes voluntary, not contractual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The silver courtyard’s mercury-weeping statues and thawing cereus physically constrain her path and echo her predecessors’ fates. The prism’s quartz facets refract stakes into bruised light that later collapses into sand—setting as active antagonist. Micro-setting (veins of silver in alabaster) maps her own heart, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—break the lullaby or lose collective desire—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened by each untied knot. Agency is hers alone; the courtyard snow retreating beat-by-beat externalizes rising cost. One decisive reversal: stepping into the mirror-darkness, surrendering personal memories to awaken the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of stolen vs. chosen desire emerges through concrete acts—echo-harvest, knot-untying, statue-hollowing—never thesis. The final garden of glowing silhouettes offers a non-literal answer: liberation is terrifying and collective. Subtext hums in mercury tears turned orbiting stars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; syntax mirrors heartbeat iambs and refracted light. “Bodily poetic” and “arterial red” feel native to Lys’s courtesan-poet diction. No head-hopping; compression (“between sigh and smile”) is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (lace veils = frost + courtesan veil). No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates through knot-release beats, then exhales in the low chord that vibrates pelvic bones. Minor purple in “frozen teardrop” but forgiven under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The echo-harvest, chaste courtesan, and prism sanctuary synthesize into a fresh myth that feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off: collapsing sanctuary into chiming sand reconfigures the entire frame. No derivative echoes; the garden of glowing statues is singular.</comment>
