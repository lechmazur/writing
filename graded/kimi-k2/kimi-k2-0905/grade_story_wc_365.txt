<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the map-maker’s sensory obsession and guilt are palpable. Her contradictory impulse—charting absence while weaponizing knowledge—drives the climax. The final renunciation (“chart consequences”) is earned by the prior revelation of complicity. Minor: younger-self cameo is more tableau than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the loom collapses to a single ethical thread with undeniable cost (“I funded the cover-up”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of parallel bays tightens into one irrevocable stance. Transitions across shards are legible and purposeful. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Repair bay, shard, and loom function as micro-settings that physically redirect her body and choices. Sensory specificity (rust-dust, emerald hum) is selective and stakes-driven. The floating vacuum bay constrains zero-g tactics. Final bruised-gold dawn recharges the bay’s broken ribs into a legible question.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover the weight of a withheld truth”—escalates through each bay until the lover’s locker delivers the crushing payload. Each parallel strand raises the emotional cost; the final tightening forces her to redirect every future commission. Cost is visceral: swallowed data-cube, glass shard spent, complicity exposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the sensory map-maker’s guilt: knowledge as weaponized absence. The withheld truth’s mass is dramatized, not stated. Final image (“broken ribs settling into the shape of a question”) offers resonant non-moral answer. Subtext in shard’s silence and locker’s float carries the ethical repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“tasting rust and forgotten fuel”) is consistent. Compression and elision (“cyclically spontaneous”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the map-maker. Syntax mirrors her weaving attention without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory data, memory, and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“loom,” “trapped cicada”) are coherent and purposeful. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory cartography + multiversal loom as ethical reckoning. Trope of “abandoned spaceport” is transformed into a guilt engine. Risky structure (mosaic shards) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of copper wire and green glass makes the concept inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
