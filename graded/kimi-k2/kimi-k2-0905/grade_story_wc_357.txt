<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aera’s interior contradiction—curiosity vs. inherited stoicism—remains embodied in micro-choices (arrowhead grip, leap into sky-leaves). The final graft of her memories into the sapling is earned by the prior tactile sequence and carries visible cost: she relinquishes private grief to become conduit. Voice stays particular, never drifts into label-speak. Only minor cap: no second on-page character to test status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing arrow fused to living wood crystallizes the new covenant—resilience is reciprocal echo. Causal chain holds: arrowhead found → echoes gathered → sapling prism → memory graft → keeper burden. Gravity inversion hour supplies tight external clock; every beat narrows options until the final charged poise. Cost is legible in the glowing tip she must now carry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but navigational instrument: water ribbons climb arches, leaves become stepping-stones, hollow in stone is exactly arrow-width—each detail constrains Aera’s next move. Sensory hierarchy skews to pilot’s priorities—air currents, bark shelf, moss temperature—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through zero-g ballet. Final sapling of light roots anchors the image, recharging every prior arch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where does resilience come from?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the arrowhead forces her to host ancestral voices. Mid-story acceleration blossom/rot cycle visualizes the cost of failed adaptation, foreclosing the option to remain mere observer. Protagonist agency drives the turn: she presses the shard into the hollow, trading private memory for collective endurance. Price is persistent—she leaves carrying the transformed arrow, future inversions now personal duty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete transfer mechanics: endurance is not trait but graft, requiring literal insertion of self into stone archive. Final image of simultaneous orchard blossom reweights the opening question without moralizing—answer is communal exhalation, not slogan. Subtext operates in gesture (tightened glove, calmed veins) and silence after the choral convergence. Avoids thematic echo penalty; no character states the thesis aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aera’s perceptual signature—irrigation streams read as musical notation, arrowhead vibrates like tuning fork. Syntax mirrors pilot’s rhythm: long gliding sentences during drift, staccato fragments under acceleration bloom. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses exactly as gravity loosens. Distinct diction (“frost laughter,” “pest indifference”) keeps voice from generic lyricism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose density high: each sentence advances image, motion, or stakes; no synonym churn or scaffold. Mixed metaphors avoided—water ribbons as “music scores” stays consistent with pilot’s frame. One minor loop: “roots easing free…soil that would soon forget which way was down” restates inversion already implied; costs −0.1. Otherwise rhythm breathes with scene tempo, final line “quiet fireworks of yes” lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of agrarian orchard with inverted gravity physics feels inevitable yet unseen before; resilience reframed as literal graft rather than metaphor is fresh inflection. Risk-taking (zero-g arboreal ballet, echo-archive in stone) heightens stakes without gimmickry because every rule is taught through Aera’s sensory trial. Transformation test passed: story collapses if orchards are terrestrial. Specificity of luminous fruit, twin suns, and water scores prevents template drift.</comment>
