<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aera’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. inherited duty—are embodied in her tactile reading of water currents and her surrender of memories to the sapling. The arrow-tip exchange crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she relinquishes private grief to become conduit. Interiority is specific, sensory, and never lapses into label-speak. Only a slight safety-hedge in the final orchard tableau keeps her from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Aera’s stance shifts from seeker to keeper, cost paid by the memory-offering and the glowing arrow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo layers density until the sapling prism reweights the premise. Causality is clean: arrow insertion triggers bloom, gravity inversion is taught early and paid off. No orientation drift past 120 words; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and the sapling’s light-roots are never backdrop; they constrain every move and charge the final image. Micro-setting (arrow niche in stone) functions as pivot. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and proprioception under weightlessness, filtering through Aera’s pilot priorities. One minor spatial blur during mid-air leaf-stepping prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where does resilience come from?”—tightens through the hourglass of gravity inversion. Each beat escalates: blight memory → echo voices → accelerated generations → memory tithe. Agency is continuous: Aera chooses to insert the arrow and surrender memories; luck complicates but never rescues. Cost is legible in the jade arrow and the orchard’s synchronous blossom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the reciprocal graft: endurance is not hoarded but transmitted. Subtext lives in the arrow’s blackened metal → living wood transformation and the silent choir of past growers. Final image—“a quiet fireworks of yes”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: giving is also taking under inverted gravity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aera’s perceptual signature—water scores, root pressure, tuning-fork arrow vibration. Syntax flexes with gravity loss: longer sinuous sentences during drift, clipped fragments under re-entry. No head-hopping; dialogue is absent but voice remains distinct through sensorial diction. One register wobble (“conceptual repricing” feel in final paragraph) nudges down.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “roots easing free of soil that would soon forget which way was down” does triple duty. Metaphors are precise—water climbs like music scores, arrow vibrates like tuning fork—never mixed. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates with gravitational shifts, culminating in the hushed blossom exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar quest-for-wisdom trope into bioluminescent orchard opera where physics invert and memory is currency. Specificity of grafting resilience via arrow-tip archive feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk—lyric compression, floating groves—heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echo; the inversion hour and echo archive are singular.</comment>
