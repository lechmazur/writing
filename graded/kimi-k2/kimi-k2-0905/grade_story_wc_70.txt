<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—truth-cursed yet forced to lie—drives every beat; the wax reanimation and coin-orbit visibly cost her the safety of routine, earning her renunciation of the toll. Embodied tension in “her truthful tongue tasted sulfur” and “coins…orbit her like copper bees” keeps emotion physical. Flaw: the boy’s abrupt exit leaves his pressure on Mara inferred rather than staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lie “There is no wonder left” reconfigures the tower’s dead circuits into living wax and open gates, with the price—Mara’s job security—etched on every coin. Causal chain (riddle → ascent → lie → lightning) is tight; only the boy’s vanish skirts full causality. Orientation is immediate; lens (Causal) holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass booth, copper cones, melted wax puddles—all constrain action and mirror Mara’s internal melt. “Nectar dusk” reappears at summit to re-color her reflection in the wax, charging the final image. Spatial choreography from booth to summit is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—tightens when the hive’s failure threatens to erase it; the lightning bolt forces Mara to wager her post for wonder’s survival. One clear escalation beat: the second riddle demands the impossible lie, narrowing options to “speak or retreat.” Cost is the open gate and etched coins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder as renewable current emerges from the hive’s collapse and Mara’s sacrificial lie; no explicit moralizing. Final image—unlatched gate, waived toll—reweights the tower from profit engine to gift economy without a thesis sentence. Subtext in the boy’s stare (“systems fall”) lingers unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s sensorium: “smell of ozone,” “brass heart beat.” Distinct perceptual signature—industrial yet lyrical—remains consistent. Compression (“hush that still clung”) and rhythmic rise during ascent support pressure without clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High-density lines (“wax wings melted into golden puddles that reflected her face in nectar dusk hues”) advance image and stakes simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; figurative language stays coherent. Only minor register lift in “crystallized final moment” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lightning-harvesting tower, failed drone hive, and truth-cursed toll keeper synthesize into a fresh myth without genre cliché. The inversion—lie to rekindle wonder—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of etched bee silhouettes on coins anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
