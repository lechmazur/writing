<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arden’s “resiliently positive” grin is the only stable axis in a tilting world; every beat shows him acting on that trait—polishing brass, humming, flipping the hourglass—so the final renunciation feels earned. Interiority stays concrete: the burn of hot glass through his coat signals cost better than any label. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he understood the price now”) that momentarily lifts us out of his skin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: two skies stitched by auroral thread, ferry entire, Arden’s choice to pour one timeline into the other costs him any dock that remembers his name. Causal chain holds—hourglass → radio coordinates → hull solidification—each beat narrows options until the final pour. One micro-turn (reversing the flow) reconfigures stakes on the page with glass-dust frost as lingering constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Basalt walls, phosphorescent barnacles, and the starboard rail flickering translucent give the grotto tactile weight; the ferry itself becomes a micro-setting whose state (solid / ghost) constrains every maneuver. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Arden notices brass and engine timbre, not tourist vistas. The spectral grotto charges the final image: stitched skies and frost on deck evolve directly from its rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—anchor the ferry or lose half-existed passengers—tightens when the grotto roof begins to knit shut, forcing the final pour. Agency is continuous: steering by heartbeat-Morse, flipping the hourglass twice, choosing which timeline drinks the other. Cost is visible: hot glass burns, auroral thread stitches skies, frost stays on deck—options reweighted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from Arden’s refusal to surrender transit itself: permanence-through-perpetual-transience. The empty hourglass, once cracked promise, becomes literal vessel of saved possibilities; glass dust on deck is the residue of that idea. No moral is stated—final image of “another ferry ride between what was and what still could be” lets the concept resonate without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person stays latched to Arden’s perceptual filter—off-key hum, salt-and-regret taste of coordinates, burn of brass caps—syntax lengthens or clips with engine rhythm. No head-hopping; radio voices are external intrusions he parses by beat. Distinctive diction (“slipping sideways,” “moon dripped like melting silver”) sustains lyric texture without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary naturally; high-density lines (“starboard rail translucent, portside solid”) do double duty for image and stakes. One mixed metaphor—“tide forgot its own name”—is forgiven because it pays off as literal world-rule. No loops or scaffold; glass dust, frost, and stitched skies accumulate rather than repeat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Takes the familiar “vanishing ferry” trope and makes it a bidirectional timeline graft whose cost is measured in remembered docks never reached. Hourglass without sand, radio broadcasting heartbeats, barnacles spelling coordinates—all particular to this voice. Risky lyric compression holds coherence; closure would collapse if any element swapped.</comment>
