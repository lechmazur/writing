<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arden’s resilient optimism is embodied in concrete micro-choices—polishing brass, flipping the hourglass, steering by heartbeat Morse—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation (pouring one timeline into another) carries visible cost: the hourglass crumbles to frost. The single POV remains coherent, and the moment of choice crystallizes his flaw-driven arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ferry becomes “a single arrow pointing toward one coherent tomorrow,” with the grotto gone and the price—glass dust on deck—explicit. Causal linkage holds: every maneuver guided by barnacle coordinates and heartbeat radio tightens stakes until the decisive reversal of the hourglass. No orientation debt; the speculative rules are taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s phosphorescent barnacles and knitting stalactites constrain steering choices in real time; the ferry’s flickering hull and dripping moon anchor the scene to body and tool. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Arden’s professional eye. The final image—open water and a horizon that “kept its promises”—recharges the earlier grotto coordinates with earned coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—anchor the ferry in both timelines or lose the half-seen commuters—tightens through each beat: barnacle coordinates, heartbeat radio, hull flicker. Agency is continuous; Arden’s steering pattern and hourglass reversal narrow options until the final pour costs the grotto itself. Pressure escalates under a causal lens with unmistakable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence and transit; the hourglass’s transformation from timekeeper to “weight of saved possibilities” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in Arden’s sideways smile and the radio’s whispered thanks—implications of uncounted lives now coherent. The ending image offers a non-literal answer: the horizon “kept its promises,” crystallizing the cost of chosen coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and pressure-responsive: “the moon dripped like melting silver,” “timelines knitting like cables.” Syntax mirrors Arden’s resilient cadence, compressing under stress yet never opaque. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight to the deckhand’s perceptual bias, and the final line’s sideways smile carries the POV’s signature irony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, information-dense, and free of loops: each sentence advances image, choice, or cost. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent; no mixed vehicles or register drift. The closing cadence—glass dust “settled onto the deck like frost that chose to stay”—balances lyricism with clarity, charging the final beat without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The vanishing-ferry conceit is synthesized through specific nautical detail and timeline mechanics rather than generic portal tropes. The hourglass’s empty bulbs filling with constellations, barnacle Morse, and heartbeat radio feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken—slipping sideways, half-here hull—yet coherence never falters, yielding a fresh angle on multiverse transit anchored in one man’s grin.</comment>
