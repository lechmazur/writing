<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian’s mute interiority is embodied in micro-choices—adjusting shutters, raising the mirror—yet the “half-spoken secret” remains abstract, softening the final cost. Motivation is consistent but not sharply escalated; the dance of light feels ritual more than risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter adjustment and mirror reflection layers density until the final image reweights darkness as partner. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—darkness “full of borrowed starlight”—with felt cost in the guardian’s nightly return. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, wet cobbles, and reeds are filtered through the guardian’s precise attention; the dental mirror becomes micro-setting that constrains every move. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final shimmer across water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching darkness to value stars—tightens via incremental light patterns; the cost is the guardian’s eternal nightly labor. One deepening beat: darkness grows “thinner and more translucent,” proving progress yet demanding endless repetition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as empathy, darkness as loneliness rather than evil. The final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing, letting the mirrored star speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric, hushed cadence mirrors the guardian’s silence; diction is spare yet luminous. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (bruised sky, darkness pooling) are precise and purposeful, never muddying causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—mute guardian, starlight redemption—are transformed through tactile specificity and the dental mirror’s unlikely magic. The synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
