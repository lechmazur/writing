<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alden’s fear-of-color flaw and map-making compulsion are embodied in every beat; the punch-to-chest micro-choice crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Interior contradiction pulses in real time—precision vs. confession—without therapy-speak. The final act of painting with his own blood-blue is earned by every prior withheld word.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank canvas reconfigures all prior route-mapping into arrival, cost paid in dissolved punch and reopened voice. Causal chain holds—each punch-click strips a memory until confession becomes the only remaining track. No orientation debt; tunnel geography and timeline stay legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Starlit mist, cedar scent, and glowing cracks are not backdrop but active rails that steer Alden’s feet and later seal behind him. The observatory roof memory returns as micro-setting that charges the final canvas. Sensory hierarchy filters through his cartographer’s eye—every arrow and constellation is noticed because it threatens or enables his next choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice vs. silence—tightens with each punch-click; the dare forces a single irreversible escalation. Agency is absolute: he must speak or be spoken for, and each confession lights a literal compartment. Cost is visible—memories torn out, tunnel sealing—so pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of cartography-as-avoidance emerges from concrete action; no abstract thesis intrudes. The final image of drawing an honest line reweights every prior map without moralizing. Subtext operates in the glowing cracks and ticket notches—silence as fare, confession as arrival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively Alden’s: analytical, color-shy, synesthetic (“tasted of unvoiced confessions”). Rhythm modulates—long, map-like sentences collapse into punch-clack fragments under pressure. No POV drift; even the supernatural tunnel is filtered through his cartographer’s perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each metaphor earns its keep (“starlit vault in mist,” “fortress of unread journals”). No loops or scaffold; repetition is purposeful (punch-clack echoes). Figurative language stays coherent—cedar, steam, ultramarine paint form a consistent sensory palette.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The phantom ticket-punch-as-stylus is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of bureaucratic and artistic tools. Risky supernatural tunnel never feels gimmick because it literalizes Alden’s internal map. Specificity—sigil from dreams, cedar-scented mist—anchors universals of fear and confession.</comment>
