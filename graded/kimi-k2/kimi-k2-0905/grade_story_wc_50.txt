<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ansel’s interior contradiction—rational locksmith who courts wonder—remains embodied in micro-choices (feeding silence into gears, sealing the silver face). The cellar renunciation carries visible cost: he locks the door with a key he will never copy, foreclosing future access. Reflection-as-perception motif keeps his perceptual signature distinct; no stock self-diagnosis. Only mild reserve: the mother/mayor memories are vivid but external, not fully dramatized as present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the silver face that “reflects nothing” reweights the premise—time is restored yet stripped of echo, a felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mirrored delay thickens pattern until the single boy-image disgorges lost hours. Causality intact—reversing the echo-harvest literally rewinds the season. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) taught by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics: slick floor dictates cautious footfalls, mirrored veins supply the angles Ansel must measure. Light-slides create the archive of stray moments, directly enabling the climax. Quartz reflections evolve from scenery to tool to charged final image. Only hairline slip: no tactile temperature cue despite “cold light,” a missed sensory lever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore stolen time—tightens when Ansel discovers scalloped metal proof that voices were currency. Reversal: instead of harvesting echo, he pays with silence, narrowing his own future access (locked cellar). Cost legible on-page: the silver face reflects “nothing,” a permanent void traded for village clocks striking again. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no need for multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—wonder versus reason—emerges through action: storing wonder in a locked cellar rather than explaining it away. Final image of cherries dropping “beyond the edge of hearing” reweights earlier echo-harvest as gentle, ongoing absence. No moralizing; the ambiguity (wonder stored, not killed) lingers. Subtext in gesture: sealing the timer with a mirror trained on future implies unseeable consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice carries a lapidary cadence that mirrors marble grain; compression like “brass guts jingling like distant cowbells through a fever” is taught early and sustained. Perceptual signature—peripheral focus—filters every observation, never abandoned. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Psychic distance stable; free-indirect bursts (“I will store wonder…”) remain anchored in Ansel’s diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from crystalline fragments to longer breaths that mimic light-slides; no template cadence detected. Figurative density is high yet purposeful—each metaphor (frost on dying breath, translucent moths) charges the echo/time conceit. Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances image or stakes. Minor register elevation (“crepuscular”) fits the lyric locksmith, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—echoes as mechanical fuel—feels fresh yet inevitable in hindsight; small-town clock-failure grounds the fantastical. Transformation test fails if Ansel were any other tinkerer: his locksmith’s obsession with keys/shelves/cellars is specific. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: mirrors-delay as time-archive is non-obvious. No close echoes of famous scenes; imagery of “seconds settling on ribs” is singular.</comment>
