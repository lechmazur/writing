<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gryphon’s contradictory impulses—yearning for company yet guarding the exact loneliness that defines her—are dramatized in the stone-circle refusal, with embodied cost (“the brittle awakening cracked further”). Interiority stays concrete and bird-specific; the only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-labeling (“translate isolation into independence”) that slightly blunts immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rotated sundial writes “Alone,” reconfiguring solitude from wound to tool with visible cost (the disappointed hum recedes). Accumulative lens holds: each lyrical shard adds density until the final image crystallizes choice and stakes without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brass sundial, salt-crystal shelves, and atomically reflective feathers are tactile, plot-functional tools that constrain the final act of naming. Spatial choreography is clean; the only minor slip is “clouds between shelves” risking momentary vertigo, but it serves the dream-logic and is quickly re-anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—singular creature vs. annihilating chorus—tightens once: the stone-circle offer escalates pressure, her refusal forecloses absorption and makes the cost legible (chorus withdraws, moonlight admitted into sternum). Agency drives the turn; no reversal is needed in this lyric frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: solitude reframed as generative cartography rather than absence. Final image of the cloud-page becoming “a tiny moon” reweights prior motifs without moralizing, offering resonant proof that refusal can be creative rather than nihilistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at precise psychic distance—close enough for hollow-bone sensation yet wide enough for mythic sweep. Syntax feathers into rhythmic flight, mirroring the gryphon’s glide; no head-hop or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is dense and musical; figurative layering serves the accumulative lens without clogging. One mixed metaphor—“continents of possibility” inside a sternum—barely grazes clarity, but momentum never stalls and no scaffold loops appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Reincarnating library above clouds, last gryphon cartographer, and spectral chorus compress extinction into a private cartography lesson—synthesis feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky lyric structure pays off in a closure that could not exist in prose realism.</comment>
