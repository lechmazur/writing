<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—human mind inside extinct body—drives every choice; embodied emotion (trembling legs, muzzle on stone) anchors the arc. Micro-choice to place the sundial at center crystallizes the shift from communal memory to singular future with visible cost (memory split). Motivation remains coherent: translate isolation into independence. Minor: archivist’s hiss is generic, not character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s shadow soldered to stone splits past/future with conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—leap from library → henge → prairie—each because/therefore step narrows options. Orientation taught early (marble shelf, tidal library). No teleporting props; brass sundial carried throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment (tidal library, bluestone henge, vacuum-jar daylight) constrains every move; henge vibration frequency dictates memory trade-off. Micro-setting of brass sundial as armor charges final image. Sensory selection (salt-stiff scrolls, static under hooves) filtered through quagga perception. Spatial choreography clean: leap, landing, circle walk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens at henge when memory must be traded for momentum. Escalation driven by protagonist agency: placing sundial at center forecloses communal past with felt cost (shadow soldered). No coincidence resolves conflict; tide of air arrives only after choice is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: solitude as propulsion, not pathology. Subtext in final prairie of silence—each blade a tuning fork—reweights earlier rifle cracks into possibility. No moralizing; resonance arises from specific equation etched on brass. Complexity preserved: independence costs communal memory, yet is celebrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “moon-lit catalogues of salt-stiff scrolls,” “vacuum jars of daylight.” POV stable; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“pages turning whenever the whole airborne archive rose and fell”) and paid off in star-corridor. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven: archivist’s hiss fits world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language precise—“hum rose up to meet her like a net of sound”—without muddle. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses for wonder, staccato for leap. No register drift; diction stays within quagga-perceived world.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct quagga reincarnated as architect of cloud-library seeking independence. Tropes transformed—reincarnation becomes ontological engineering, not wish-fulfillment. Specificity of brass sundial as both timepiece and sail feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode pays off in final prairie of silence.</comment>
