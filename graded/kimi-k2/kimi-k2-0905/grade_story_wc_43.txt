<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her “decisively kind” stance masks private grief; the vinyl shard’s scent triggers micro-choices that alter Calderon’s dying moment and her own closure. The cost—carrying both broken halves forward—earns the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each hymned sound layers pressure until the monitor flattens. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Mara’s reunification of the record reconfigures meaning with felt cost; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass-floor ward, cumulus cities, and vinyl shard function as micro-settings that constrain choice; the shard’s cool edge against Calderon’s pulse is tactile and stakes-shaping. Atmosphere of “bleach and resignation” mirrors internal stakes without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“a flawless goodbye”—tightens through sensory accumulation; each mundane sound narrows options until silence. Agency rests in Mara’s renunciation of repair; the cost is the irreversible stillness on the monitor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between fragmentation and continuity; the broken record becomes a non-literal answer: reunify ≠ repair. Subtext in Calderon’s fingertip braille and Mara’s sternum press avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—petrichor-scented lullaby, “pulse fluttered like a trapped moth”—maintains perceptual signature under pressure. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare yet subtextual (“Thought vinyl was extinct”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates with dying breaths; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise—“clouds glowing pink from unseen sunset” recharges closure. Zero artifacts in peak beats; high density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice setting transformed through synesthetic hymning and vinyl-as-relic. The scent-of-hope concept feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in lyric compression pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
