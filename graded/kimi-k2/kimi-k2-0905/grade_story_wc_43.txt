<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is palpable—the broken record as metonymic hope, the micro-choice to press vinyl to Calderón’s pulse—and her decisive kindness turns a ward into ritual. Moments of embodied contradiction (hope inside hospice death) feel individual, not diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal spine is clear: because Mara needs the goodbye to feel real, she improvises a synesthetic lullaby; because Calderón cannot “end clean,” the shard transmits scent into wordless goodbye. Closure is a Charged Poise—final image of twin fragments forming a lightning bolt—whose cost is legible: reunification does not erase jaggedness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cloud-level hospice, bleached corridors, and glass-floor city lights anchor and re-appear; the broken record operates as a micro-setting pressing against skin. Setting constrains every move—the monitor’s “pulsing stillness” and the low hum of the building are hymned into the lullaby itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake signaled early: deliver a flawless goodbye before death. Tightening occurs with the second song—when scent is transposed into sound—narrowing options from “stay” to “go” while making the cost (Mara must let go a second time of her father fragment) unmistakable in the last image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: reconciliation is imperfect union, memory as vinyl splice. Subtext lives in the daughter’s drought-ending weep—the vinyl shard reweights grief into continuity, not repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice distinct—compression in “pulse monitor blinked pulsing stillness,” lyrical precision in “steam from morning coffee, ozone before snow.” No head-hop; Mara’s noticing remains therapist-filtered. Syntax mirrors breath control—rising hills flatten into one long line at stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; each figurative beat earns its place (“clouds drifted… like scattered embers” reprises dusk lighting). Rhythm breathes in step with monitor peaks; final sentence holds sonic after-image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Use of scent as transposed sound, of hospice as cosmic observatory, is refreshingly non-obvious. Not just gimmick—device serves the closing conceptual repricing, not ornament.</comment>
