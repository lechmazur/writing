<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. self-erasure—are embodied in the borrowed heartbeat and the wing’s pull. Micro-choices (climbing, lunging for the wing, knotting thread) reveal a hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of anonymity carries visible cost: he accepts the donor’s public vocation. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance crystallizes—he will carry stories outward, trading invisibility for resonance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of gathering voices charges the final image. Causality intact: each sun-trail convergence and voice absorption tightens stakes. Cost felt in the saturated wing and seven indigo knots.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house, valley-mist, and morpho wing function as micro-settings that constrain movement and meaning. The wing’s color shift and the stones’ residual warmth directly shape Kael’s choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys his dye-master’s eye. Final image of the glowing wing recharges the opening valley-mist wonder with earned weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: trade anonymity for narrative magnetism. Pressure tightens as each sun-trail and voice absorption forecloses retreat; final knotting ritual crystallizes the cost. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Escalation is accumulative: voices fill the hollow he might have kept empty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges: stories magnetize because they carve hollows others must fill. Subtext carried by the wing’s drinking of voices and the indigo knots. No moralizing; final blessing of valley-mist wonder reweights premise without statement. Complexity preserved: anonymity lost, yet tenderness gained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature of a color-worker saturates every image. Syntax modulates with pulse: long breaths in calm, staccato lunges under pressure. No head-hopping; single POV held. Dialogue minimal but apt: proprietor’s line teaches pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers color, sound, and motion. Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Zero loops or scaffold. Rhythm mirrors heartbeat acceleration. Opening and closing lines echo without repetition, creating charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—dye master with borrowed storyteller’s heart seeking why stories stick—feels fresh. Synthesis of sun-trail cartography, morpho compass, and voice flask is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off. Specificity prevents template drift.</comment>
