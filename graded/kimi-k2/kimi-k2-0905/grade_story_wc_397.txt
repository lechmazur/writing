<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—spectator vs participant—drives every beat; the parasol tip handed to the boy crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost (she forfeits her heirloom and her original plan). Interiority is embodied and specific (“fold in patience…balanced like a question mark”). Secondary characters (boy, elders) exert immediate pressure that alters her stance. The final choice to stay and listen rather than leave is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the horn’s second, softer note signals the mercy ship itself has learned hesitation, reweighting the premise. Causal chain—tourist → volunteer → listener → mentor—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift. One transition (night to dawn) is legible. Cost is on-page: heirloom relinquished, original mission abandoned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains every move—skidding plates, groaning floes, frostbite. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining the final choice when planted upright. Sensory detail is selective (salt-tasting chime, grinding hymn) and filtered through Mara’s biased attention. Spatial choreography is coherent across the gangway, tent, and crack of ice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to witness endings—tightens when Mara refuses to record final words and instead offers tea, narrowing her options. Escalation is driven by her agency: each act (volunteering, handing over parasol, serving tea) raises the cost of remaining passive. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the boy’s recognition is seeded by heirloom history. Price is felt: she loses relic and original purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: witnessing vs companioning, patience as usable endurance. Subtext resides in gesture (two taps of parasol) and silence (no recorded words). Final image—ivory tip humming in wind—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every image reweights the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Mara’s (“fold in patience,” “sound that tasted of salt”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, winding sentences under calm, clipped fragments during the chase. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (boy’s gust-like speech).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“folded the air like linen”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—acceleration across ice, hush at dawn. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—euthanasia tourism turned compassionate witnessing—feels non-obvious and fully committed. Parasol tip as tuning fork for silence is a fresh inflection. Synthesis of grief, lace, and ice is inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
