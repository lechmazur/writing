<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s shift from voyeur to volunteer is embodied in tactile micro-choices (still fingers, lifted parasol, shared tea); the boy’s arc from mute grief to rescuer is equally earned. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic, and the final renunciation carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s refusal to board the ship re-weights the entire premise, crystallizing the “fold in patience” as a hinge rather than delay. Causality holds; every beat flows from the prior under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure: groaning plates, grinding hymns, and the parasol planted in a crack of ice all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to witness endings without becoming spectacle—tightens when Mara chooses to serve tea instead of recording last words. The cost is felt in the elders’ spoken recipes and the boy’s step back from the rail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: grief as teacher, listening as salvation. The final image of the parasol humming in starlight offers a non-literal answer—salvation is portable, provisional, and shared—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; the narrator’s perceptual signature (“sound that tasted of salt and lullabies”) is consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful, never ornamental, and the final cadence—“a sigh that keeps going”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise is inverted into a meditation on listening as rescue; the parasol’s reprise as tuning-fork for silence is a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
