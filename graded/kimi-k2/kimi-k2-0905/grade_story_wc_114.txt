<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oracle’s embodied fever-memory and micro-choices (sketching leaves, stepping into snow) reveal contradictory impulses; final renunciation of the stone costs her the oracle’s burden yet leaves her “temporarily innocent,” a credible Earned Stasis with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each smudged leaf and instrument echo tightens the weight of truth until the stone’s evacuation reconfigures sky and valley; causality intact, cost legible in the dimmed aurora and hushed antenna.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Weather station, cot, anemometer, and snowfield are filtered through fevered perception; the blanked botanical map constrains the final burial choice, charging closure with place-specific sorrow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“exact weight of swallowed truth”—escalates via bodily intrusion and external omens; the decisive expulsion forecloses oracle power, price paid in 4.7 grams and temporary valley innocence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth’s unbearable mass emerges through chlorophyll sorrow and auroral light; final burial of the stone offers resonant, non-literal reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric, fever-bright diction stays oracle-bound; perceptual signature (“tasting iron and pine resin,” “chlorophyll sorrow”) remains consistent; no head-hopping, taught pattern of sensory elision paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pressure beats; no loops or mixed metaphors; clarity preserved even at lyric height.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle myth and meteorological grief; transformation test passed—story collapses without fevered mountain station and swallowed truth conceit; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
