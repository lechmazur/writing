<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sister’s ghost appears on-page—interior contradiction and embodied grief are visible; apology is embodied in rosin-apology and spoken renunciation. Micro-choice to keep the echo instead of release the miracle aligns with flaw of 'silence as tidy'.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens: sister-banish → guilt → archive visit → apology + release = Renunciation/Earned Stasis. Perfume bottle choice and induction current guide hand to exact folder—closed causal chain. Felt cost archived in bottle + felled orchard E-chord confirms closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archive, bottle, and shadow-ghost act as micro-setting constraining every beat; fluorescent hum as lament sets stakes. Orchard engines and last tree’s E-string directly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake: forgiveness vs silence; pressure tightens from banished ghost to archived apology. Choice to release ghost with cost—‘kept the echo’—narrows options irreversibly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through music/archival metaphor and scent-memory: absence is dissonance; reconciliation is resonance without tidy moral. Final lilac bloom out of season is earned, non-literal reply to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First-person POV remains lyrical yet specific—‘rosin apology’ reveals character flaw without therapy-speak. Perceptual signature uses music syntax for perception: “arpeggios of dust”. Distinct rhythm persists through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear test pass; metaphor density is high but purposive, no looped stem structures obscuring cause. Final third free of artifacts; closure line clean. One paraphrase-loop adjacent lines (“imperfect miracle”) lightly penalized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Exorcist celebrity genre turned intimate grief portrait via scent-memory + archival resonance. Fresh risk: archived apology + acoustic closure. Small deduction for near-echo of ‘imperfect miracle’, yet transformation feels inevitable.</comment>
