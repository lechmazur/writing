<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirage’s interiority is vivid—her self-advising metaphors, the embodied shame of “gossip drain from her like ink”—and her micro-choices (tilting the bottle, writing the confession) reconfigure the relationship with visible cost. Julian’s spectral presence supplies relational pressure that forces her stance crystallization. Flaws and contradictions (profiting from pain, fear of flat notes) drive the final renunciation. Only a hairline slip: Julian’s late articulation of “pain is public domain” edges toward thematic label rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology is heard once, irreversibly altering both archive and self; the orchard’s hum drops half a step, a felt cost. Causal chain—bottle → induced current → confession → dissolution—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; transitions are legible within the single-scene window. No telegraphing or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sheet music archive constrains every beat: steel shelves as frozen chords, the forbidden fountain pen, the smudged treble clef that becomes the apology’s medium. Orchard outside supplies the ticking clock; its final wind-chord cannot be replicated by machines. Micro-setting (perfume bottle on staff paper) charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered, never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver an overdue apology—tightens once: the confession must be written on the spot before chainsaws start. Agency is renunciation: she forfeits her career (“would not write about this”) and exclusive rights to Julian’s pain. Cost is legible in the fading notes and the orchard’s irreversible song. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: commodified pain vs. public domain grief, the ethics of spectacle. Subtext operates in the smudged clef, the orchard’s unrepeatable chord, the silence after Julian inhales the storm. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: apology as current that keeps inducing smaller currents. No thematic label in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, noir-lit: “yesterday’s headlines like a shroud.” Perceptual signature is Mirage’s: she hears blood, tastes copper, sees photographs swim. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (“single drop fell… ink bleeding”). No head-hopping; Julian’s speech is spectral rustle and whisper, tonally separate. Experimental elision (Morse-flicker lights) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks. Figurative language is disciplined: “moonlight smiles on broken glass” lands without muddle. Syntax modulates with urgency; no filter-verb stacks. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the reconfiguration. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—celebrity exorcist haunting her own ex—synthesizes fame, grief, and spectral musicology in a non-obvious way. Transformation test: story collapses if names or venues change. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: apology as electrical circuit that erases itself. No close echoes.</comment>
