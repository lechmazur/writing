<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calyx’s surrender to the canyon’s stitching is embodied in sleepwalking, bleeding, and sewing; the interior contradiction between dread and hope is palpable. Motivation intensifies from passive haunting to active sacrifice, culminating in the palm-prick that costs blood and the plate. The Earned Stasis—returning to the empty wharf humming—shows the price of endless service. Yet the lack of secondary pressure or relationship crucible keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven bridge reopens the sea, the loom sinks, and the canyon reseals—an irreversible change with felt ecological and personal cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stitch releases memory, density rises until the fabric blooms, and the final hush reweights all prior salt and orchid imagery. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by the glowing canyon walls and moonlit cavern. The cost is legible in the dissolved plate and Calyx’s blood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The red canyon walls, driftwood loom, and returning tide constrain every choice: walls shift to grant passage, loom demands blood, tide reclaims the path. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Calyx notices orchid scent, sandstone grit, moonlit milk—never tourist catalog. The loom functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it sinks beneath the waves. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the sea’s path by redeeming broken precedents. Pressure tightens as each stitch consumes memory and blood, narrowing options until the final bridge is irreversible. No coincidence resolves; the canyon’s sigh is earned by the weaving. The visible cost—blood, plate, endless nightly duty—charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: orchids blooming in saltwater embody “ruin to reverence” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the loom’s hunger for blood and the canyon’s maternal hush. Final image—orchid at every reflection—reweights the premise that broken things remember their names. No thematic echo; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “orchid solace—sweet, funereal” distills tone in three words. Perceptual signature is Calyx’s—he tastes salt, feels pollen ink, hears the canyon’s lullaby. No head-hopping; POV distance stays intimate. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long sentences for drift, fragments for stitches.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “threads crawling up the walls like ivy of light” does triple sensory work. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only hairline slip: occasional stacked modifiers (“luminous and impossible”) but they serve the lyric swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of weaving, tide, and canyon mythology feels inevitable and fresh. The broken precedent concept is embodied in porcelain plate and salt orchids, not stated. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final bridge of verses. No derivative echoes; the image of a loom sinking beneath returning tide is singular.</comment>
