<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caldera’s refusal of vaccines, ledger-diving, and final public utterance all spring from a coherent, embodied drive; the femur-stylus beat crystallizes her value hierarchy with visible cost. Interior contradiction—rational rebellion vs. macabre practicality—plays out in concrete micro-choices. No headcount issues; single-POV interiority stays specific and pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the counter-clock narrative is physically lodged in the burial sump, foreclosing denial with conceptual cost. Causal chain—cog → reflection → map → femur-stylus → public warning—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sewer’s descending strata act as a living chronometer, constraining Caldera's route and supplying the slate ledgers that fuel her counter-narrative. Marble domes, census parchment, and tide-scent are filtered through her biased attention, never ornamental. Final image of sunrise over slime-slick stair recharges the drowned-city motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the city will fossilize in denial or accept honest grief—tightens as Caldera’s descent literalizes the cost of truth. One decisive deepening: the burial sump forces silent consensus among corpses, reweighting her task. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between sedimentary lies and tidal truth; no explicit moralizing. Final line reconfigures meaning without stating a thesis. Subtext in the cog’s ghost heartbeat and ink-bleeding census sheets carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is dense, salt-etched, and philosophically baroque yet always anchored to Caldera's sensorium. Syntax mirrors her slow filtration method: long clauses sifting toward grit. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon even at lyrical peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive despite density; every sentence layers pressure or atmosphere. Metaphors (broken teeth, fossil of shame) are precise and internally consistent. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with descent/ascent motion. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-plague drowned Venice reframed through sewer archaeology feels non-obvious and inevitable. The counter-clock conceit synthesizes chronometer tech, plague ledgers, and tidal ontology into a fresh moral calculus. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
