<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—cynicism vs. need to rescue her own creations—drives every beat; the final surrender of the shell shows earned cost. Yet the refugee boy and pianist are sketched more as emblems than full agents, capping intimacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s offering of the shell crystallizes her stance and reweights the premise. Causal chain holds—each cameo arrives because of a prior deletion, and the final chord resolves inside the shell with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The feral nexus is evoked through salt-tasting mist and tidal motion that literally push Mara’s choices; the shell becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, charging the lighthouse image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“collect hopes or lose everything”—tightens when each cameo exacts a price; the vortex of unread pages forces the decisive surrender. Pressure escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens via density of apparitions and shell weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of returning stolen voices; no moral is stated, yet the final lighthouse image reweights the premise. Subtext lives in gesture—the boy’s freckle, the pianist’s silent keys—avoiding abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “mist tasted of salt and wet paper” marries sensation to vocation. Compression and patterned elision (“ink-veined Lira”) are taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Only minor loop risk in “swirling hush” repetition, but it serves cadence and never obscures causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—unfinished fictional hopes materializing—feels fresh, executed through specific, irreversible details (mother’s ear-trumpet shell). Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
