<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow’s interiority is vivid—her cautious weaving of truth is dramatized in every beat, from the cold-burning candles to the second heart she accepts. The contradictions (listening to ghosts yet guarding herself) are embodied, not labeled. Final renunciation—leaving the mirror—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the intact snow globe crystallizes the before/after of salvage and teaching. Causal chain holds—dream summons globe, globe demands analysis, analysis yields shrine, shrine yields choice. Cost is legible in the glacier’s groan and the footprints filling with future meltwater.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glacier, shrine, and snow globe function as micro-settings that constrain every move: ice walls stick skin, candles burn cold, globe’s weight settles like a heart. Sensory selection (crevasse-blue starlight, salt-tasting hymn) is filtered through Marrow’s professional attention. Final mirror of ice recharges the setting as both tool and image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage something pure—tightens through each descent: shrine cracks, corridor narrows, passengers sing. One meaningful deepening: the intact globe demands she become its future teacher, foreclosing solo anonymity. Cost is felt in the glacier’s closing throat and the glittering dissolution of the dead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of salvage-as-transmission emerges from concrete acts: melted globe reweights to intact globe, cameo faces reconfigure from random to tapestry. No moralizing; final image of footprints filling with future light invites open reflection. Resonance arises from specific objects and gestures rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, ocean-cold. Perceptual signature favors tactile and synesthetic detail (“tasted like salt and forgiveness”). Patterned elision (dream logic, glacier speech) is taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; interior texture remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise (“glacier groaned like a sleeping whale”) and never muddle causality. Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with descent and ascent. Final line’s cadence mirrors the story’s exhalation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—wreck-diver ghost whisperer salvaging dream artifacts from a glacier-ship—synthesizes familiar tropes into something non-obvious. Risky lyric structure pays off: dream-to-reality bleed, miniature shrine within globe within shrine. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
