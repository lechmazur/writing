<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow’s interiority is vivid—her “second heart” moment embodies the cost—but the cameo-analysis method is asserted, not dramatized; we never see her actually sift a dream. The final smile is earned, yet the absence of on-page micro-choices while “analyzing” keeps her just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror-of-ice reconfigures every prior cameo into a legible tapestry, cost paid in the glacier’s re-claim. Accumulative lens holds—each shard adds density until the final cadence shift—but the causal leap from “found globe” to “understands pattern” is ellipsis, not dramatized beat, preventing a flawless 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Glacier, shrine, and unfrozen sphere are tactile constraints: skin sticks to ice, candles burn cold, the globe’s weight settles “like a second heart.” These micro-settings force her slower ascent and final relinquishment; the mirror left on snow is environment charging the exit image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“salvage something pure”—tightens when the glacier demands silence, then cracks, forcing her deeper; the price is the mirror she must abandon. Escalation is accretive, not reversal-based, but the absence of a live alternative after the crack keeps pressure coherent yet not razor-sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective rescue emerges through image, not thesis: cameo strangers re-thread into a tapestry whose pattern is legible only after she gives the globe back. The final snow-flake windows refract “someone else’s rescue,” reweighting wreckage as cradle—an earned, non-moralizing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught early by crevasse-blue filters and “borrowed starlight,” sustained without head-hop. Rhythmic compression (“glacier groaned like a sleeping whale”) mirrors diving breath-control; final open smile releases the guarded cadence, proving deliberate modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, motion, myth—without scaffold; only the phrase “windows of connection” risks mild abstraction, but it is immediately anchored to ice walls and candles. No mixed metaphors or loops; read-aloud rhythm accelerates ascent, then stills on the mirror, propelling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes dream-cameo archaeology, ghost-whisperer wreck-diving, and melting relics into an inevitable fable about shared salvage. Risky accumulative structure pays off: the reader feels the tapestry form in real time, a freshness that would collapse if any trope were swapped out.</comment>
