<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest’s interiority is vivid—his trade of a sunrise for the palette, his deliberate starvation of the demon with ambiguity—but the congregation remains a collective blur; no single worshiper’s micro-choice under pressure is dramatized, so the relational crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the priest steps into his own loop, becoming the living anchor while the demon is trapped in endless recursion; the cost—eternal self-erasure—is legible in the final image of a “statue ears could see.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s “fold in space” and “vaulted ribs” are tactile constraints; the palette’s ultraviolet stain and the null-air pockets physically shape the ritual choices, culminating in the nave cupped “under water.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from collective salvation to the priest’s self-sacrifice; each loop subtracts certainty, narrowing options until the demon is lured into the recursive trap—visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: faith as recursive doubt, silence as ornament, possession as the need to be possessed—culminating in the resonant image of the priest frozen inside his own question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, modulating from incantatory cadence to hushed stillness; the patterned elision (“I illuminate hidden assumptions, I illuminate…”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“rosary of clicks,” “Möbius strip of intent”) are precise, no loops or scaffold, and the final cadence slows to a breath-held hush that mirrors the frozen loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit—exorcism via recursive rhetoric and ultraviolet silence—is wholly fresh; familiar tropes of possession and priesthood are inverted into a meditation on doubt that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
