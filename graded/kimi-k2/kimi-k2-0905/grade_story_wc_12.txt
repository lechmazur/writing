<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is richly rendered; the priest’s swallow of doubt with a mouthful of iron is palpable embodied cost. No knowledge drift or labeling voice; stakes tighten in proportion to fear. Cast abides single POV rule.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands hard: infinite reverse swallows all sound layers, reconfiguring collective stance into “ordinary chip of paint.” Causal chain—loop ➔ plumb ➔ dissolve—is seamless; no unkept detail. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marble nave, cracked fresco, and ultramarine-blue negative-space cross act as tools that constrain final choices; dimensional anchor’s hold released by the swallow-backwards reversal. Each detail carries weight without surplus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—“will hidden doubt be contained?”—tightens each layer reverse-records. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; possession’s passing through the open door is felt, not declared.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme of faith as wall vs. door emerges wordlessly; woman’s reprise “the wall is only blue because we agreed not to touch it” crystallizes it without preachiness. Final image reframes wall/blue without labeling.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</question><comment>Voice is distilled and priest-specific: hush “that grew teeth,” vowels sagging until “sentence sounded like surrender.” Compression, half-speed playback, and sensory shorthand all taught early and paid off.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Sentences are taut, each advancing layer or sound. One mixed metaphor (“thick as incense yet odorless”) is easily cut; otherwise zero redundancy or drift that dulls closure beat.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Possession-as-acoustic parasite looped into reverse-swallow feedback is fresh; ultramarine color sink as negative-space theology feels inevitable in hindsight. High conceptual risk kept legible.</question>
