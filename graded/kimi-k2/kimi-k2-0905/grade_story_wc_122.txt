<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory internal impulses (“feel” versus “cannot hear” grief) are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—filing the needle, pressing shellac to skin—earning Renamed Stasis with the visible cost of open sobs. Temen’s steady counter-pressure via signed gestures tightens her final stance without diluting focus. Numbness as lived contradiction is embodied rather than diagnosed; no stock phrases intrude. One minor drift: the phrase “she welcomed it like a drumroll” flirts with tidy emotional arithmetic, slightly softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens tightens steadily: each reversed note peels a felt layer from the cocoon until the fused drum-and-phonograph beat crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable cost—grief now lived inside her bones. Causality survives small elision; no teleporting props. Closure image (“drum to her heart, feeling every beat”) reconfigures world-weight forward. One tiny seam: the snow “hush she could almost hear” repeats the motif but already landed closure, so effect is cosmetic rather than causal.</comment>

<comment>Cedar-dust motes and goatskin “moonlit lakes” ground orientation early. Micro-setting of body plus workbench constrains file pressure and heartbeat transmission; drumhead becomes tactile room. Time is “early-evening snow,” spatial anchors remain intact. Felt bearings, fossilized spark—all sensory choices are selective and purposeful, charging the final co-listening image without clutter.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is to unmuffle grief—pressure escalates through the one reversal of “backward spin” that sucks numbness out. Each tactile beat (turning lathe, tightening cords, needle touch) visibly costs effort and narrows options toward fully felt sobs. Agency remains on the page—no off-stage resolution. Cost is visceral, legible, and final.</comment>

<comment>Theme crystallizes via embodied sound-as-touch; no overt thematic statement mars the late lines. “Silence waiting to be spun backward into song” is the closest echo yet earned by preceding felt vibration, so resonance outweighs mild assertion. Subtext operates in gestures and silence rather than meta-commentary. Ending offers charged poise rather than tidy moral.</comment>

<comment>Third-person close sticks to Mara’s sensorium; POV distance never wavers. Percussive diction mirrors tactile focus— “cracked cedar dust,” “shy knock.” Compression in “Together they threaded goatskin...” serves momentum. Register stays within a deaf musician’s lexicon. No head-hopping; Temen’s inner life remains opaque without leakage. Rhythm accelerates naturally toward heartbeat crescendo.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and musical: sentences vary in length, propulsion maintained. No synonym loops; figurative strands stay coherent (“filament of hush” recurs only once, then earns reprise). Small over-alliteration in “a filament to remind her that numbness...” glints but does not stall. Occasional hyphenated descriptors (“broken-wing” tone-arm) are legible and voice-driven. No clarity issues in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief processed through touch-sound substitution inside a drum-makers’ cavern. Backward phonography and deaf perception create an inevitability that feels wholly earned. Specificity—filing the snapped brass tip, lathe hush, skin-tensioning ritual—elevates familiar grief arc. Risk in reversed lullaby pays off without gimmickry. Cannot be retitled and still function.</comment>
