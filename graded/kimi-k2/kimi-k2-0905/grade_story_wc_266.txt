<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marta and Jun register as functional archetypes rather than individuals; their interiority is poetic but interchangeable (“shoreline lullaby tone” is applied to both). The hound’s shift from lost to willing guardian supplies the only credible change, yet it is external to the humans, so the guides’ own stakes feel static. No micro-choice by either guide visibly costs them anything, muting earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the hound’s voluntary return reconfigures the crossing from chaos to order (Resonant Reconfiguration). Causality is soft—Jun’s star-stamp gesture is more symbol than trigger—but the pattern holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is secure within 120 words; only the “leash” logic remains fuzzy (who leashed whom?) yet does not rupture the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mist, lanterns, and cliff-that-shouldn’t-exist create a liminal micro-setting that mirrors the hound’s disorientation. The ticket punches and star stamps act as tactile “micro-setting” objects that constrain the final beat. While the ridgeway’s rules are never defined, the sensory selectivity (amber pools, dew-matted fur) keeps atmosphere integral to mood without stalling motion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the crossing’s guardian”—is clear, but pressure is carried by the hound, not the protagonists. Guides face no escalating cost; their trek is observational until the symbolic stamp. One meaningful tightening occurs when paths tangle, yet the guides adapt without trade-off, keeping escalation mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of “courage unused dwells within” emerges through the hound’s arc rather than the humans’, muting resonance. Recurrent star-stamp imagery reweights at closure, but the insight is voiced by Marta in thesis form (“courage unused still exists within”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the fable structure supports a coherent after-effect without moralistic overkill.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice sustains a misty, incantatory cadence that fits twilight vigil. No head-hopping; perceptual filter stays collective-guide. Occasional elevated diction (“liminal shore,” “constellation of light”) borders on template poeticism but remains internally consistent and readable aloud.</comment>

<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled, with only minor scaffold (“the sound guided them…”) and no mixed metaphors. Information density is high; most sentences serve atmosphere plus forward motion. A few near-repetitive participial openers dull peak propulsion slightly, yet clarity at closure is untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mythic-ferry trope is refreshed by focusing on the escaped guardian rather than the souls, and by stamping partnership instead of ownership. Specific detail—star stamp on canine forehead—creates a memorable image. Risk is moderate; the piece avoids generic fantasy names but leans on familiar “liminal threshold” imagery without subverting it further.</comment>
