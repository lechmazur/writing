<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta and Jun show clear, embodied motives; the hound’s shift from mournful to willing guardian is earned through micro-choice (star-stamp touch). Interiority is concrete, though the collective “guides” remain slightly generic. Cost is visible: the hound’s self-chosen duty replaces leash-bondage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hound’s voluntary return re-orders the crossing. Causal chain—hound escapes → guides track → star-stamp re-crowning—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the hound’s relinquished freedom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Veiled ridgeway, amber lantern pools, and shoreline mist are vivid and selective. The cliff that “shouldn’t exist” constrains route choice; star-stamped tickets act as micro-setting tools that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory hierarchy reflects twilight urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore safe crossing—tightens when the hound’s absence tangles routes. One meaningful deepening: indirect paths force guides to confront the hound’s crisis. Agency rests with Jun’s stamp; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Felt cost: hound’s self-binding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “unused courage lies within” emerges through action, not assertion. Subtext in hound’s mournful howl and Jun’s gentle persistence. Final image—hound choosing duty—reweights the leash symbol without moralizing. Resonance lingers in shoreline lullaby.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient remains stable; no head-hopping. Prose texture is lyrical yet controlled—“breath on cold glass,” “constellation of light.” Dialogue minimal but natural; Marta’s lullaby tone distinct. Patterned diction supports twilight vigil mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful—paw prints “like breath on cold glass.” High information density: each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor elevated diction (“liminal shore”) fits mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ferry guides, star-stamped tickets, and escaped guardian hound create a non-obvious myth. Tropes transformed—hound not recaptured but re-crowned. Emotional specificity grounds the fantastical. Risk in lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
