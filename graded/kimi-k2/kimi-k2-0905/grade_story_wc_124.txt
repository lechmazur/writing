<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “aromatically cautious” refrain shows simultaneous fear and longing. His micro-choice to pour the drop onto the orchid root crystallizes a hierarchy of values—grief over profit—and the cost is felt. Secondary pressure is minimal (only the orchid), but the relationship with Lira is rendered as crucible through scent-memory. One hairline slip: “broker in him insisted on cataloguing cause” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian leaves the greenhouse having renounced lantern-selling for scent-brokering, with the empty vial among the roots as visible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer reweights the stake until the final shift. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. The transformation completes exactly at the beat of renunciation, satisfying on-page causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse is rendered as sensory cathedral—iron-and-meteor soil, ultraviolet stained-glass petals—yet always filtered through Elian’s urgent bias. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, pour, stand, exit. The orchid itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. One minor redundancy: “extinct plants” twice in first two paragraphs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to grieve without being destroyed by scent—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when Elian chooses to inhale despite risk. The ultraviolet reveal escalates pressure by making memory molecules visible, forcing a decision. Cost is palpable: the empty vial and blue breath-lanterns carry away part of the ache. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief is a greenhouse where extinct feelings are coaxed back into temporary bloom. The orchid’s metallic note reweights “Maybe tomorrow” from promise to elegy. Subtext operates in gesture—kneeling, pouring, leaving—never exposition. Final image of invisible gardens trafficked by scent-brokers offers resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled synesthesia (“cathedral of invisible colors”). Patterned repetition—“aromatically cautious,” “crystal shadows”—serves as incantation rather than loop. No dialogue, so no register clash. One near-slip: “broker of invisible gardens” risks coined phrase, but lands within established idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data without clogging momentum. Metaphors are coherent—lanterns of breath, galaxies of pollen—and serve emotional stakes. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor: “as though reluctant to volunteer for evaporation” could trim two words, but cadence justifies it.</comment>

<comment>Premise—scent as time-travel after olfactory collapse—is fresh, yet grounded in intimate loss. The extinct-orchid genome reawakened by perfume esters feels both wondrous and inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off: the final transformation of lantern broker into scent broker is earned, not gimmick. No close echoes of prior work.</comment>
