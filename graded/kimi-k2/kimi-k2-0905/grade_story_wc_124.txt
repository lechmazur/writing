<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is precise and embodied; the contradiction between broker-calculation and raw grief is dramatized in every micro-choice (uncapping the vial, kneeling, pouring). The final renunciation—abandoning lantern-selling to become a “broker of invisible gardens”—is earned by the prior aromatic cautions and the orchid’s pulse. Only a hairline slip: the phrase “broker of invisible gardens” edges toward label-speak at the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian’s stance crystallizes when he leaves the vial among the roots and chooses cultivation over commerce. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer deepens the stake until the ultraviolet glow reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the final inhalation that now contains “forgiveness distilled from orchid, metal, and the last shared breath.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is no backdrop; its ultraviolet panels and extinct orchids actively constrain choice—only here can scent survive, forcing Elian’s experiment. The crystal vial and ghost orchid function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; every object’s position is tracked through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to grieve when scent itself is dying—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened by each aromatic beat. The orchid’s metallic note forces a new recognition (hospital bracelet), narrowing options to either flee or cultivate. Cost is visible: the empty vial left behind and the blue lanterns of breath released.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: grief as cultivation of extinct perfumes. The final image of “crystal shadows of fragrance” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the stolen bracelet scent, the orchid’s sympathetic opening—never exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, wistful yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through olfactory obsession. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, ribbon-like sentences slow to match reluctant evaporation, then tighten at the climax. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elian.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence performs multiple jobs. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors, no loops. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with emotional pressure. Only minor scaffold: “aromatically cautious” repeats twice within three lines mid-story (−0.1).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>The olfactory-collapse world and lantern-broker occupation feel inevitable, not contrived. The synthesis of grief, commerce, and resurrected orchids is non-obvious yet coherent. Risk-taking (extinct-genome orchid responding to human esters) pays off emotionally without gimmickry.</comment>
