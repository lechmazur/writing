<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the face-blind artist’s perceptual world is rendered through tactile, synesthetic detail. Motivation crystallizes in the micro-choice to paint absence rather than likeness, foreclosing recognition as refuge. The flaw (prosopagnosia) is not merely stated but weaponized into a filter that shapes every stroke. Cost is felt in the final renunciation of the painted sky itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of painting the sky becomes an Earned Stasis—she walks away carrying only brushes, the library’s knowledge now internalized. Causal chain from coin indentations → constellation pattern → negative-space portrait is airtight. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake without causal reversals. Cost is legible in the demolition countdown and the candle’s final flicker.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tree-trunk library is not backdrop but crucible: living shelves breathe, roots entwine texts, demolition charges travel through cambium. Micro-setting (coin, knothole window, candle) constrains pigment mixing and brush reach. Spatial choreography is flawless—coin pressed to wall, vibrations up through root systems. Final image of painted sky glowing amid rubble charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory of sky before erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each countdown siren. Escalation is Accumulative: each notch on the coin deepens saturation, each explosion tremor accelerates brushwork. Agency is renunciation: she completes the portrait then abandons it, paying the cost of permanent exile from the only sanctuary that accepted her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: limitation as filter, memory as negative space. No moralizing; the note’s aphorism is dramatized, not preached. Final image reweights the premise—identity survives not in faces but in the sky-shaped absence between them. Subtext hums in the braille of stars, readable only by future fingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, fractal syntax mirroring the protagonist’s perceptual mode. Perceptual signature is consistent: “shoulders carry invisible weight, how hands speak truer than mouths.” No head-hopping; POV remains locked inside the artist’s synesthetic cognition. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors, no loops. “Fractally precise strokes, each eyelash rendered in mathematical succession” is both beautiful and causally tied to her condition. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise is startling yet inevitable: a face-blind artist tasked with memorializing human presence by painting absence. Transformation test passed—swap any detail and the story collapses. Risk-taking (negative-space portraiture, tree-library) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis of synesthesia, demolition, and archival impulse.</comment>
