<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the “charcoal line printing a ghost” on the bus window crystallizes her renunciation. Motivation pivots credibly from revenge to self-reinvention, paid for by the literal scattering of the ledger. Micro-choices—dropping beads, pocketing obsidian—track her value hierarchy under pressure. One minor slip: the phrase “discovering purpose in the pauses” edges toward label-speak, blunting the moment slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she steps off the bus having foreclosed the smugglers’ path and her own complicity. Causal chain holds—each breadcrumb bead is later reclaimed, proving the reversal was seeded early. The ledger’s disintegration is the visible cost that locks the choice. Orientation is clear by line 3; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and kiln residue are filtered through the artist’s trained eye—frost “silvered the ground like her own imperfect glazing.” The obsidian shard later constrains her final action (bus fare), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating geography. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal state without cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—moral complicity versus creative integrity—tightens when she chooses to scatter the ledger instead of using it. Pressure grows via the flaking charcoal and the need to decide before dawn. Cost is the forfeiture of both revenge and safety. One clear escalation beat suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between transparency and erasure; the final image of “molten light” reframes earlier fire as renewal rather than destruction. Subtext resides in silence—the coyote song and frost patterns speak louder than exposition. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the blank bus sign. The charcoal line fading on glass is the resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is luminous, compressed, and glass-specific: “kiln’s last exhale,” “stone throats.” Syntax modulates with stress—long lyric sentences under stars, clipped fragments on the bus. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the artist. Occasional risk of overwriting (“luminous glass artist” repeated) is offset by rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (“glass fragments ignited into floating sparks”). Metaphors are coherent—glass, fire, frost form a sustained lattice. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) appear but never in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph nails the cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “artist on the run” trope by reframing the ledger as permission to stop running. The glass-blowing occupation is integral, not ornament; failed shards become literal breadcrumbs. Risk-taking in structure—quiet renunciation instead of showdown—pays off. Specificity of glaze recipes and frost reading anchors the premise.</comment>
