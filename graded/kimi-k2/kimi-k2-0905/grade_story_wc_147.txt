<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. duty, flee vs. stay—are embodied in salt-tears and bruised knees; the final renunciation (leaving the vial) costs her last anchor and is earned by the temple’s adoption of her memories. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific; no stock labels. The lone POV keeps focus tight, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple’s hush becomes resonance, Mira’s signal escapes, and the cost—her solitary near-death and forfeited keepsake—is legible in the final image. Causal chain (vial → organ → amplified signal) holds; no teleporting props. Orientation is clear by line 3; deliberate lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Flooded nave, coral organ, and copper coil constrain every choice; the empty vial placed on the console charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—salt tears, luminous plankton—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track. Environment evolves with events (stone tendrils loosen).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape before air runs out—is signaled early and tightened when the temple’s hush actively muffles the call. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she overrides instinct, pries open the organ, and sacrifices the vial. Cost is visible: lungs burning, vial lost, possible death. No coincidence resolves; rescue is earned by the signal she creates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: solitude transmuted into shared memory, stone taught to yearn. Subtext lives in gesture—the temple “laughing” with her, lilac blossoms in bubbles. Final image of perpetual aria offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity lingers: rescue may still be too late, yet hope persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“violet star” drop, “slowmotion thunder”) is Mira’s own. Compression and elision are consistent and taught early. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Tense and psychic distance remain stable; no filter-verb stacks under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“cathedral-wide resonance”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor purple risk in “luminous plankton” is earned by climax intensity. Rhythm modulates with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater temple as lonely choir, scent-as-frequency, memory as liturgy. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific details (coral organ, copper coil) resist template swap. Transformation test: story collapses if elements changed. Bold yet inevitable.</comment>
