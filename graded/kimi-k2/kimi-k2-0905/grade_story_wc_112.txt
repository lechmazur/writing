<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich, embodied, and contradictory: the mechanic’s mechanical lungs hum in “companionship” rather than servitude, revealing layered acceptance and resistance. The refusal to file a report—an earned micro-choice—crystallizes her arc without tidy resolution. Only the younger self’s hesitation lacks full causal weight in the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final footstep offset by “one degree less” reconfigures future possibility with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each holographic pulse, moth-bat wingbeat, and lever degree tightens the pattern toward the final image. No orientation debt; spatial and temporal anchors are immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station’s violet cloud-sea, twilight corridors, and aviary ribs are filtered through the mechanic’s selective attention; every detail constrains movement or charges the nexus. The magnetic sphere and moth-bat wings function as micro-setting that physically shapes the sideways-time experiment. Final lattice image reweights all prior sensory data.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—tightens through each holographic pulse and lever micro-adjustment. Pressure peaks when the mechanic realizes both futures feel true; the cost is the perpetual twilight of refusal. Agency remains hers, yet the subdued awakening of the station itself complicates resolution without external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the mechanic’s bodily negotiation with mechanical warmth and sideways time; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of the younger self “waiting for the next twilight” reweights the entire premise into quiet, resonant ambiguity. Subtext operates in the nexus’s lattice and the moth-bats’ subsonic hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the nexus pulse: “icy warmth,” “subdued awakenings.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final offset footstep. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the mechanic’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or pressure. Metaphors (“chrysalis knows the world outside yet refuses to emerge”) are coherent and purposeful. High information density without overwriting; diction stays within the mechanic’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of xenobiology, holographic time theory, and bodily prosthesis feels inevitable and fresh. The sideways-time proof as doorway rather than theorem transforms familiar SF tropes. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
