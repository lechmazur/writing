<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (duty vs. hope) play out in micro-choices like sealing the envelope. The final act of placing the button in Marcus’s file is a credible renunciation that costs her the fantasy of personal reunion, scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Rowan’s act re-weights the archive from mausoleum to living compass. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each dust pattern and memory layer tightens the stakes until the final image of the glowing afterimage crystallizes the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The foster-care file room is rendered through selective, urgent detail—peppermint scent, cardboard smell, fluorescent hum—each constraining Rowan’s choices. The brass button functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, its worn eagle a tactile bridge between past and future.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether a small kindness can redeem a wasted past—escalates through tactile beats: discovery, reading dust, sealing the envelope. Each beat narrows options until the final act forecloses Rowan’s private hope, paying a visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: archives as futures disguised as pasts. The button’s migration from rebel artifact to gift re-weights the premise without a single explicit statement, achieving a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and absence. Patterned elision (“unknown, but breathing”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and action. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“sunrise over a battlefield”) are coherent and purposeful, accelerating toward the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—an archivist who rehomes a lost war artifact to a ghost child—feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of foster-care bureaucracy and WWII insignia transforms familiar tropes of loss and rescue.</comment>
