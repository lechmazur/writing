<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—staying for money vs. waiting for kindness—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (brushing dust, sealing the envelope). The final act of placing the button in Marcus’s file is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she relinquishes the private talisman that linked her to her uncle. Minor slip: the “broken-hearted” label is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Rowan’s stance toward the past shifts from guarding to releasing, crystallized in the envelope and the snow-lit whisper of “Marcus.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns and button accumulate meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the relinquished button and the open corridor of uncertainty she now walks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mildewed file room is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (peeling label, fluorescent hum) that constrains choice—Rowan’s movements are bounded by drawers, boxes, and the single lamp. The brass button functions as micro-setting, its dents and halos guiding her final decision. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transforming private grief into a bridge for another child—is signaled early and tightened when Rowan chooses to archive the button with Marcus. The deepening occurs through the dust-reading beat, which reweights the unknown histories from burden to possibility. Cost is visible in the relinquished heirloom and the open-ended future she embraces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: archives as futures disguised as pasts. The button’s migration from personal relic to potential lifeline reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Final image—snowflake dissolving on her palm while she whispers “Marcus”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of whether kindness can survive institutional erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in Rowan’s perceptual signature (“dust coughed,” “sunrise over a battlefield”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; short, breath-like clauses under the lamp give way to longer, drifting sentences in the corridor. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and forward motion. Metaphors are precise and earned (“dust ridges read like wind”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“tactfully hopeful”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Final third is artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—an archivist reassigning a war relic to an erased child’s file—feels fresh and inevitable. The synthesis of bureaucratic detritus, intergenerational loss, and quiet redemption is specific to this voice and setting. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
