<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—scientist’s need for control vs. plant empathy—drives every beat; embodied pain and micro-choices (clipping leaf, surrendering to veins) are specific and costly. Final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible bodily cost. Minor slip: “terrified” is a label, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: storm → leaf anomaly → transformation → surrender. Closure is a Decisive Change (human to plant) with felt cost (loss of body, agency). Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Nursery, trellis, storm, and silver-veined leaves constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (leaf on wrist) functions as setting-as-constraint. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control vs. symbiosis—tightens as storm pressure mounts. One meaningful turn: surrender to metamorphosis narrows options irreversibly. Cost is visceral (skin splitting, rooted legs) and legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of surrender to unknowable natural forces emerges through concrete events, never stated. Final image (silver-veined leaves bearing Mira’s face) offers non-literal, resonant reweighting of knowledge vs. relationship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—scientific precision laced with awe—remains consistent. No head-hopping; POV knowledge is modest. Prose texture mirrors Mira’s analytical lens until it dissolves into vegetal rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, varied rhythm, zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and integrated; no mixed vehicles. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of body-horror botany and lyrical surrender. Transformation trope is grounded in specific plant science and personal scars. Risky choice—protagonist becomes plant—pays off with coherent closure.</comment>
