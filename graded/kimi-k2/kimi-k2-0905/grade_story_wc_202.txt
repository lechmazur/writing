<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion are vivid; the adult’s decision to surrender the shard to child-self crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Motivation—honoring overlooked histories—drives every beat and the final renunciation. Micro-choices (leaning into the painting, singing the lullaby backward) are character-specific and pressurized. The only minor slip is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness in “I understand now that intuition is not a compass but a tide,” but it is brief and does not undercut the earned closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s return reweights the premise and leaves the narrator anchor-less yet resonant. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light-returning across beats tightens until the final image. Orientation is taught early via the swaying catwalks; no disorientation persists. Cost is legible in the line “its absence weighs more than its presence ever did.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is anchored by the rope bridges and rooftop market; the micro-setting of the painting becomes a literal threshold that constrains the protagonist’s choice. Sensory detail is selective—copper-salt air, humming ropes—filtered through the translator’s priorities. The final rooftop sweep of the new scaffolded lighthouse reconfigures the lost tower’s absence. Spatial choreography is clean across catwalk, pigment, and city.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return what was taken before loss calcifies—is signaled early and tightened through the shard’s glow and the painter’s heartbeat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the adult hands the fragment back; the option to keep it is foreclosed with felt cost. Agency is the protagonist’s; coincidence (finding the painting) complicates rather than resolves. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of custodianship and release. The final image—“We keep the light by letting it go”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shard’s warmth and the gull’s heartbeat. Recurring light motif reweights meaning at closure; no token symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is the translator’s synesthetic noticing (lens “warm as skin,” pigments “a syllable”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—short clauses under vertigo, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. One line drifts toward editorial certainty but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“market folds into fog, elusively tangible”—and avoid muddle. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Opening and closing lines are sharp and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The alchemist’s market, time-travel via pigment, and shard-as-bone synthesis feel inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test: story would collapse if any element were generic. Risk-taking (stepping into a painting) is grounded in character need. Specificity—“tide-gnawed ruins,” “scaffolded lighthouse”—anchors universals.</comment>
