<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is character-particular and embodied (“sap that formed faces… mouths open in silent accusation”); the nut-contradiction under tongue drives the final choice. Causality for the graceless duty is clear, and the earned stasis—continued imprisonment in the orchard—carries visible cost. One missing micro-choice (why she never questions or tests the curse) keeps it from 9+. Relationships as crucible not applicable; solo POV.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Situational (pressure forces crystallized stance), closure unit is Earned Stasis—she enacts the rescue yet must return. Because mechanical birds & frost rules are consistent, and every warmth-handprint is legible causality toward the last traveler’s correct turn. One brief orientation shimmer (“two centuries dead” is un-anchored) but does not confuse. Closure cost—perpetual exile—appears in final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is fully tactile—brass wings clicking, cliff shadow kissing frost line—and every environmental detail either constrains choice (birds, frost countdown) or charges the last image (frozen handprint fossils). Mechanical birds and labyrinth walls are micro-setting that alter tactics and are impossible to swap. Only a single anachronistic flick keeps it under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>One dominant, clocked stake: guide travelers before deadly frost, which tightens every beat. No extraneous reversals; each ghost-arrow is agency-driven and forecloses options (no audible shout possible). Final price is the frost sealing her own exit; pressure crystallizes into stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Graceless beauty of saving strangers” emerges through embodied action rather than thematic statement. Nut-micro-blueprint, cursed orchard, and mechanical birds triangulate the lonely ethics of invisible caretaking. Final image of fossil handprints reweights premise without didactic framing. No late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is intensely tactile—“iron and pine,” “chill seep”—and perceptual signature tight in each filtering motion. Rhythm flexes with urgency, then slows for final frost crystallization. Compression is purposeful: mechanical birds’ gear lullaby functions as taught shorthand. No dialogue present, so voice assessed as pure narration; no register drifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and load; each does multiple jobs—“wind hissed … dusk”—without scaffold loops. No strained metaphors under pressure; information density is high. Zero loops, zero typos, zero muddle in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cursed orchard + mechanical labyrinth + microscopic blueprint nut is a synthesis fresh to genre. The rescuer condemned to perpetual service flips the savior-trope with felt cost. Every fantastical machine feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (“microscopic ridges,” “brass wings clicking like metronomes”) cements originality.</comment>
