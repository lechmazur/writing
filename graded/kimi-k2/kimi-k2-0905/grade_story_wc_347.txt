<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—her hatred of the orchard, the nut’s weight in her pocket, the chill seeping through her glove—yet her contradictory duty to guide strangers is dramatized through micro-choices (warm handprints, tongue-rolling the kernel) rather than labels. The cost is visible: she can never walk the path she charts. Minor slip: “graceless beauty” edges toward diagnostic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s refusal to enter the labyrinth crystallizes her perpetual exile while the travelers escape. Causal linkage is tight—each warm impression narrows their options and her own. The final image of frost-sealed fossils reweights the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost-laced grass are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the setting actively constrains Mara’s tactics (she cannot step on stone) and supplies the hidden smugglers’ stair. Sensory hierarchy reflects her urgency—cold, wind, brass wings—without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide the lost before frost—tightens with each warm impression; the mechanical birds and approaching frost escalate pressure. Agency is renunciation: she forecloses her own escape to secure theirs. Cost is legible in the final fossilized handprints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of duty versus self emerges through concrete action: the orchard’s accusatory faces versus Mara’s wordless guidance. Subtext operates in gesture—nut kernel as silent covenant, warm handprint as unspoken farewell. Final image of sealed fossils offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, tactile (“brass wings clicking like metronomes,” “nut rolled under her tongue like a secret coin”). Perceptual signature is Mara’s: selective attention to cold, sap-bleeding trunks, mechanical lullabies. No head-hopping; distance remains intimate third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during bird-hover, longer cadences in reflection. Minor elevated diction (“graceless beauty”) slightly above POV lexicon but consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—caretaker bound to cursed orchard, guiding strangers via heat-ghosts—feels fresh and specific. Mechanical birds and blueprint-nut are transformed from potential clichés into lived constraints. Risky lyric compression pays off in the frost-sealed handprint closure.</comment>
