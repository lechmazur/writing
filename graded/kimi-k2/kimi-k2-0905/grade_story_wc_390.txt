<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mireya’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat syncing to centuries of ice, her tears tasting of whale song—yet the “logically emotional” trait is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final renunciation (save artifact without destroying town) is earned by the sonic calculus she performs, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pier, key, and bone resonate into one organ, reconfiguring stakes without tidy resolution. Causal chain—Echo cracks → shadows rise → vibrational matching → third path—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in the marina’s survival and Mireya’s worn-smooth key.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: ice calving underfoot, pilings humming like organ pipes, the key transmitting glacier memory through wood. Final image of stars spiraling like the Echo’s fossil recharges the setting as cosmic map of absolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—nightmares solidifying without the Echo’s frequency—is signaled early and tightened by calving ice and advancing shadows. Mireya’s agency drives the third-path solution; the cost (marina’s near-destruction, key’s eroded teeth) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as listening rather than conquering emerges through sonic imagery without moralizing. The Echo’s spiral and star-map reprise reweight the premise: darkness taught to listen becomes harmless dark. Subtext hums in the whale-mother frequency, never stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic—salt-iron diction, glacier-paced cadence—anchored in Mireya’s perceptual bias. No dialogue needed; the prose itself sings. Compression (“fleshly ethereal”) is taught early and paid off in the final choir of silhouettes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “low, mournful chord that made the pilings hum like organ pipes” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances stakes or resonance. Metaphors (key’s teeth “filed into frequencies”) are precise and world-bound.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Sonic absolution as salvation-through-listening is a fresh synthesis of whale bone, lighthouse engineering, and nightmare physics. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when shadows become luminous townsfolk—earned, not gimmick. Spiral motif evolves from artifact to star map with inevitability.</comment>
