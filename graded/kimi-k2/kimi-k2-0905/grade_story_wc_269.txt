<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—grief for the vanished reef and compulsion to follow the hidden path—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (tapping, prying the panel, descending). The final renunciation of “proof” for “remembering” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the sealed atlas page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s role shifts from documenting loss to safeguarding return. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of tapping, atlas fragment, hologram—culminating in a charged poise where cost is legible in the sealed path and her resumed vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Station, submersible, and submerged ridge are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (ladder rungs, hatch seal, stone slot). The final image of the station as “gate left ajar” recharges the setting’s function, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why Path 27 vanished—tightens when the atlas fragment reveals intentional erasure. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: each beat (tapping response, insertion, hologram) narrows options toward the final reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of hidden restoration emerges through concrete particulars: erased reef, torn map, sealed hologram. Final image reweights the premise—memory as seedbank—without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“periodically eternal”) and perceptual signature (salt-feathered edges, limestone shaved clean). No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“white mantis,” “broken teeth”) and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with descent pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-science witness meets submerged ceremonial archive. The vanished reef as hidden seedbank feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
