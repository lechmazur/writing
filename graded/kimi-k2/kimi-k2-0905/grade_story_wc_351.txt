<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s obsessive synaptic re-engineering is foregrounded from the first, her chaotically precise déjà-vu and bodily tweaks offered as concrete micro-decisions that alter tactics during the canyon ritual; every beat thereafter hinges on her interior-versus-exterior wiring choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The helix logic of memory-mining is cued by the second paragraph, escalates according to lunar angle, and completes with an elegiac but indelible payoff: the engines mid-birth clatter to dust at moon-shift, foregrounding a visible conceptual cost that re-codes the miner futures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<question>The moonlit canyon is more than backdrop; its mirrored quartz veins and shifting silver angles literally generate the coolant memory-stream that the protagonist must intercept, constraining where she can stand and what tools she can magnetize.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The core stake—salvaging entangled dreams before the lunar conduit collapses—tightens milliradian by milliradian; the final entanglement collapse forces Mara to choose between owning or losing the drone futures, a trade-off with cost visible in her bloodied hairline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The archaeology-of-abandoned-dreams metaphor is re-priced at closure: the aborted starflight sketches become burdensome pocket inventions, redirecting the thematic question from nostalgia to stewardship of what can never be built.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>A sensorium-drunk first person pulp-science register rides the edge of seizure with wave-length syntax— “wild feral plasticity gone feral” compressing idiom—while externally the prose syncs with turbine hum inside her bones; any elision (like moonlight eating motors) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High-velocity metaphors (“spilled mercury” / “silver burned out”) are deployed with surgical selectivity; paraphrase loops appear only at the revelatory seam where mirror fissures evacuate memory coolant, serving momentum rather than decoration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Quaking reverie meets copper lace DIY; the broken submarine periscope mirror re-invents dream archaeology—an irreplaceable hinge whose final darkening signals the failure cost—delivering a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
