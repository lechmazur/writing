<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. chaotic seizure—are embodied in the wrench-twitching calibration and the blood-threaded removal of the helmet. Her micro-choices (angle adjustment, vial drop, mirror tear) visibly alter stakes and foreclose the intact-extraction path. The final smile and pocket sketches show earned cost and forward compulsion without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the moon’s slide severs entanglement, scattering engines to dust while Mara retains irreversible sketches. Causal linkage holds—mirror angle → memory flood → motor overwrite risk → collapse—each beat tightening options. Orientation is anchored by canyon rail and lunar zenith within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon fractures and quartz veins actively constrain tactics: mirror angle must match lunar vector, quartz seams open after collapse to signal next cycle. Micro-setting (helmet, periscope shard) doubles as setting that physically channels light into cortex. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract intact dreams without self-loss—is signaled early and tightened by each milliradian adjustment. The moon’s descent forces a decisive collapse; cost is the irreversible rewiring and failed resurrection. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (moon slide) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation vs. self-erasure emerges through concrete events: the broken mirror that both grants and revokes access, sketches she cannot remember drawing. Final image—quartz seams “ready for the next dreamer”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence after voices fade.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, helical, and perceptually specific: “chaotically precise déjà vu,” “copper lace, corroded periscope glass.” Syntax mirrors engineer mind—measured, then seizure-twitch. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Mara. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, high-density; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors (“broken periscope mirror abandoned by some giant, long-dead observer”) are vivid yet coherent. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction fits POV. Final third remains clean of artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum-drill coolant as literal dream storage, synaptic plasticity as archaeological tool. Transformation test passes—story collapses if elements swapped. Risk-taking (motor-cortex overwrite, moon-phase precision) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “basalt wings that beat without air” anchors novelty.</comment>
