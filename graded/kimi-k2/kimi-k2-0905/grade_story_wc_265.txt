<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The philosopher’s interiority is vivid—she tastes oil and cinnamon on the gear, synchronizes breath with the jaguar—but the final renunciation leans on lyric assertion (“she understood then”) rather than a dramatized beat of contradictory impulse, so the cost feels announced, not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dropping the gear dissolves the canopy and rewrites the rule-set (“you are not lost; you are distributed”). The accumulative/textural lens holds—each stanza layers pattern until the cadence shift at the brook severs identity—so the before/after is legible and priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is not backdrop; the 3/4 banyan cadence literally teaches her gait, and the mercury brook mirrors her fragmenting selves, charging the final image when she becomes a new copper tree. Environment, body, and tool are one continuous constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten once: keep the gear and stay recognizable, or surrender it and risk diffusion. The jaguar’s ultimatum at the spiral kapok elevator forces the single meaningful trade-off; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and the price is unmistakable in the cyclone dissolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the pattern itself—distribution as transcendence—rather than any stated thesis. The final image of the copper tree humming with “probable miracles” reweights the earlier equations-without-moral into an earned, ambiguous wisdom: identity as chorus, not artifact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is unmistakable: synesthetic compression (“hum of insight vibrating inside her skull like a tuning fork struck by moonlight”), polymetric cadences that mirror forest time-signatures, and a perceptual signature that fuses tech and organism. No head-hopping; the lyric elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, propel information, and avoid loops; occasional stacked metaphors (“cyclone of leaves and numbers”) risk overwriting but occur after the decisive beat, so clarity of closure is untouched. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Vedic translocation myth with clockwork ecology feels inevitable and fresh; the “sound of wind through different trees” as method for mind-frontier rediscovery is a risk that pays off in conceptual repricing rather than gimmick. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
