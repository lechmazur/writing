<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“shadow-laced,” “calmly intuitive”) but remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. The final renunciation—choosing shared empathy over solitary guardianship—earns its cost through the orchard’s slow greening, yet the peacekeeper’s flaws or limits are never tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the re-lit crystal reweights the orchard and lighthouse, with the cost of perpetual vigilance implied in the final heartbeat. Causal chain (memory → shard → mirrors → reconstitution → bloom) is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition from orchard to van is clean. Orientation is anchored early by lighthouse, ice, pine.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting (frosted roots, cracked van mirrors) constrains the reconstitution ritual; the orchard’s slow greening directly charges the closure image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“amber flare scattering into a thousand specks”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pine to van to lighthouse beam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the shard’s guiding light—tightens once when the mirrors reveal futures that demand action. Escalation is accretive: each reflection adds density until the final reassembly forecloses the option of leaving the shard broken. Cost is visible in the orchard’s tentative thaw and the keeper’s unending watch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared empathy emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement; the final golden pulse reweights earlier cold silence without moralizing. Subtext lives in the shard’s “quiet light” and the orchard’s greening—both non-literal answers to the question of how anomalies become ordinary once shared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“shadow-laced,” “ticking metronome against the hull of distant icebergs”) is distinctive. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the mirrors’ ripple. No dialogue, so no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold (“each step echoed like a ticking metronome…”) is brief and voice-driven. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse, orchard, and mirror-divination feels inevitable in hindsight. The shard’s reconstitution as communal beacon transforms a familiar quest object into a living covenant. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
