<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her memory of first seeing bleached coral is visceral—but her agency is mostly observational until the final beat. The moment she realizes the atlas tear is a clue, not loss, crystallizes her arc, yet the cost is more conceptual than felt. Eli functions as mentor rather than crucible, so relationship pressure is minimal. Overall, a credible shift with visible stakes, though the emotional price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon coordinate reappears on screen, reweighting the premise that “missing paths can be traced.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tap layers pattern until the final echo reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. The only gap is the off-screen mechanism that translates tap echo into GPS coordinate, a minor ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station’s reclaimed pier, steel table, and tide-breath create a tactile micro-setting that constrains their tapping ritual. Sensory detail is selective—hum of sensors, salt sting, table’s metallic ring—filtered through Mara’s marine-biologist bias. The submerged canyon emerges as both map and memory, charging the final image. No spatial drift; weather and tech feel lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why migration paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when the watermark matches the canyon. The tap-echo test is the single meaningful escalation that forces a stance crystallization: the ocean “speaks,” confirming the canyon’s role. Cost is conceptual (reefs’ lost compass) rather than personal, but legible. No false reversals; coincidence complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: erased marine routes mirror human cartographic erasure, both symptoms of ecological loss. The atlas tear’s journey from loss to clue reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Eli’s deliberate taps, Mara’s silence after the long echo. Final image of station lights pulsing like a recalibrating compass offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic compression (“periodically eternal,” “drifting moored”) taught early and paid off in the final pulse. POV stays tight to Mara; no head-hopping. Syntax mirrors her marine-scientist precision and grief—technical diction salted with elegy. Dialogue is minimal but natural when it appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensor data, memory, and metaphor without redundancy. Occasional lyrical heightening (“kelp in a lazy current”) risks overwriting but stays within pattern. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence shift—short pulses matching taps—earns its place.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of coral bleaching, cartographic absence, and rhythmic data divination feels fresh and inevitable. The atlas tear as both wound and portal transforms a familiar eco-grief trope. Risky lyric compression is justified by the Accumulative lens and pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
