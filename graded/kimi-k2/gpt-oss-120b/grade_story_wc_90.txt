<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nara’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal of force and her micro-choice to whisper the vow; the crystal’s use as a “needle of light” links motive to action. Interiority stays concrete—“weight of those sorrows as cold pressure on her back”—but the final step through the gate feels slightly under-motivated; we do not see the moment she commits to leaving the ship forever. The earned cost is implied rather than dramatized on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locked dimension blossoms open, the ship drifts empty, and Nara’s weightlessness literalizes her renunciation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shimmer-stitch tightens the veil until the final crack. The cost is conceptual (she abandons the last human artifact) and felt in the image of “ghosts of those who had stitched peace.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The recycled hull, rusted corridors, and “ghost of forgotten propulsion” create tactile specificity; the ship’s gravity loosens as Nara’s joy rises, binding setting to choice. The locked dimension’s “luminous garden” recharges the opening void with new color, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are clear early and evolve with the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension—tightens via each shimmer-stitch; the final seam-crack is the decisive intensification. Agency is present but abstract; the pacifist constraint (no force) shapes tactics, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices for the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed into possibility emerges through the tear-crystal and the garden’s “colors that had no names,” not through statement. The final image answers the thematic question wordlessly: sorrow becomes seedbed. Subtext operates in the tear’s shimmer and the ship’s sighing hull.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation—“mournful fireflies,” “blackened sea”—that matches the elegiac tone. POV stays tightly anchored to Nara’s perception; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“gravitationally lighter”) is consistent with the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphors cohere (tear as needle, veil as fabric). No loops or scaffold detected. A few near-abstractions—“impossible physics whispered through her bones”—are earned by context. Final image is crystalline and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Buddhist relic, post-human void, and textile metaphors feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is familiar (last human, drifting ship) but transformed through the specificity of the tear-crystal and the garden of unborn colors.</comment>
