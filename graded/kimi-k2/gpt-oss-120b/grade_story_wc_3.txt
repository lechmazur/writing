<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “kindly methodical hands” and the embodied shift from haunted ambition to compassionate cultivation anchor her arc. The contradiction between preserving knowledge and letting the spirit go is dramatized in the seed-planting beat, and her final choice to descend carries visible cost (leaving the arbor’s safety). Minor drift: the “physics of transition” desire is stated more than tested in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s hum settles into Earned Stasis after Lira’s analogical ritual reweights her goal from conquest to cultivation. Causal chain holds—seed vibration → field alignment → spirit release—though the physics metaphor stays lightly sketched. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is no backdrop; its oscillating branches and silver particles actively enable the seed’s germination and mirror Lira’s internal shift. Sensory detail is selective—iron-kissed leaves, low hum—integrated through action rather than catalog. One minor spatial blur: exact branch geometry drifts during the particle cascade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding transition—tightens when the seed’s glow forces Lira to choose between keeping the spirit or letting it go. The single meaningful turn (deciding to descend) carries felt cost (loss of arbor cradle). Pressure escalates via frequency sync, not external antagonist, fitting Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of haunted ambition transformed into shared enlightenment emerges through concrete particulars: the seed’s sprout, the arbor’s re-tuned hum, the silver snow of departing spirit. No moralizing; final image of “every translation a seed” reweights prior material with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control—“magnetic arbor that floated above the clouds” teaches the pattern early. Perceptual signature is Lira’s: methodical, tactile, gently awed. No head-hopping; diction stays within her scholarly lexicon. Compression like “touching distance” pays off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion—“seed shimmered, its surface rippling like a pond.” No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” moment—feels earned. Final cadence slows appropriately to mirror arbor’s calm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cuneiform meets magnetic botany, haunted ambition re-seeded as communal knowledge. The arbor’s frequency-as-language conceit is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds; no derivative echoes.</comment>
