<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“meteor hush,” “chlorinated air”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the scar-reading motive is stated more than dramatized. Micro-choices (turning hourglass, tracing coffee ring) are present yet feel guided by external instruction rather than internal necessity. Closure is earned—accepting that wounds can hold hope—but the cost is diffuse rather than sharply felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sand, coffee rings, moss whispers layers density until the sunrise image reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—hourglass clears, melody resolves—yet the causal bridge between coffee-ring pattern and miracle-release is lightly sketched rather than rigorously forged. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Tower, tunnel, moss, and hourglass are rendered with selective sensory detail that filters through POV bias. The hourglass and root function as micro-settings that constrain the final ritual; the sunrise through the slit recharges every prior image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn to read scars”—is signaled early and tightened once when the moss demands the protagonist’s own scar pattern. Agency is present (alignment ritual) but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; tension rises through textured accumulation rather than a decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of wounds as latent hope emerges organically from the moss’s tableau and the hourglass’s clearing; no moralizing statement intrudes. Final sunrise image reweights prior motifs without explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the silence after the lullaby, inviting reflection on displaced miracles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to hush, frost, and meteor light. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the crystalline final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but figurative layering occasionally risks overwriting (“molten glass,” “meteor hush radiance”) in the final third. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusion of telepathic botany, scar cartography, and time-ritual feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through sensory specificity and emotional stakes. The risk of lyric excess is balanced by disciplined closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
