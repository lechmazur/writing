<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically specific—“notebook humming with unfinished vows” grounds her ghostwriter identity. The contradiction between keeping secrets and longing to release them is embodied when she whispers a letter into the spiral. Her final choice to guide the letters outward is earned by the temple’s sensory confirmation. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her private archive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral accepts the letters, reconfiguring Mira’s role from hoarder to conduit. Causality is lyrical but legible—each whispered line triggers a sensory response that tightens the thread. The mosaic tiles glowing with color provide on-page evidence of the decisive change. Cost is the exposure of her once-private words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and spiral are rendered with selective, sensory precision—“sequined ribbons” of rain, “pine and rain” scent. The spiral’s glow and the mosaic’s shifting hues constrain Mira’s choices, guiding her onto the path and sealing the letters. Spatial choreography is coherent: she steps, the stone transforms, the petal lands. Environment charges the final image of constellations made of ink.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: whether Mira will keep or release the letters. Pressure escalates through sensory feedback—perfume, glow, hum—culminating in the spiral’s pulse. Her agency drives the climax; no coincidence resolves it. The cost is the irrevocable exposure of her ghostwritten secrets.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: secrets are threads only when shared. The spiral’s transformation from nest to conduit mirrors this without statement. Subtext lives in gesture—placing the petal, stepping back. Final image of “prismatic quiet” offers non-literal resonance, reweighting silence as audible connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature—“humming notebook,” “soft veil.” Syntax modulates with intensity: longer cadences for awe, fragments for pulse. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Mira. Distinct texture in phrases like “prismatic yet quiet” sustains tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional stacked modifiers—“pale sunrise hovering on calm water”—risk overwriting but fit lyric mode. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with Mira’s heartbeat at climax. Minor register drift toward poetic diction is voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghostwriter releasing letters via living art installation—is fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of sacred temple and lotus are transformed through sensory specificity. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No close echoes; synthesis feels singular.</comment>
