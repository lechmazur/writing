<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman’s interiority is vivid—his listening posture, the tongue shaping dead glyphs—but the final beat (“ancestors lift”) is summary rather than embodied cost. Motive is legible yet the renunciation of further pods is only implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the last whispered phrase sinks, sealing the concord. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each bird call thickens pattern until final cadence reweights the garden as living bridge. Cost is felt in emptied box and fading reef silhouette.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Jetty’s timber sighing underfoot, phosphorescent algae, and wind-kissed orchids all constrain stance and echo loss-renewal. Final glow on new shoots charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—garden reclaiming battlefield—tightens once when coachman must trust birds to carry pollen; no further escalation, but single deepening suffices. Cost legible in emptied seed cache and irrevocable reef death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-through-memory emerges from seed pods and bird-calls without moralizing. Final scent rising from reclaimed earth offers non-literal answer that reweights earlier battlefield imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lyric, priest-like cadence sustained; diction (“bruised violet,” “submerged concord”) is character-bound. No head-hop; perceptual signature remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“narrow vastness” twice) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and closure remains clear. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Seed-memory + dead-language bird-calls is fresh synthesis; battlefield-to-garden arc feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
