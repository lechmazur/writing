<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; contradictory impulses (“light and heavy” heart) are stated rather than embodied. The camera-as-relic and sign-language-as-music premise are evocative, yet his micro-choices remain generalized. Closure earns a modest renunciation cost—he vanishes, leaving the craft behind—but the emotional price feels more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shutter-click and gesture layers density until the harbor itself becomes the final chord. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Arlen’s absence reweights silence into ongoing song—felt cost is the relinquishing of identity. Orientation is swift; transitions within the single scene are fluid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is not mere backdrop; its ripples, gull-cries, and moonlit stave actively translate Arlen’s gestures into music, constraining his method and charging the final image. Sensory selection is biased through his synesthetic perception, keeping detail purposeful and lean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning silence into music—tightens as each silent beat risks permanent erasure of self. One meaningful deepening: the moment Arlen lowers the camera and disappears, trading presence for legacy. Cost is conceptual (oblivion) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of creation-through-absence emerges organically from the harbor’s echoing gestures; no explicit moralizing. The final image of Lira inheriting the unspoken score reconfigures meaning without statement. Subtext resides in the empty camera and the etched lens—objects that silently reprice memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature tuned to synesthetic translation of wind into chords. Compression and elision (“vanished into the mist”) are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice modulation is carried by rhythmic syntax and selective sensory focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language (“silver sigh,” “living stave”) is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length to match the cadence being described. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous tableau”) fits the lyric register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit of mapping silence onto moonlit water via sign language feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse without the specific harbor-camera-sign synthesis. Risky lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
