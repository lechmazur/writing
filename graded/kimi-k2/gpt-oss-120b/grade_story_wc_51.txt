<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The weaver’s interiority is richly textured and embodied, but her motive remains a static “singular purpose” voiced like exposition without visible contradiction or flaw under pressure; the emotional arc is serene rather than conflicted, so renunciation feels gently inevitable instead of costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece deepens atmosphere until the cadence shift crystallizes release. Closure—the calcifying feather flaring sunrise on the walls—lands as earned Charged Poise with visible reconfiguration and conceptual cost, though causality is poetic rather than narrative and cost is more luminous than painful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Grotto atmosphere is immersive, specific, and synesthetic; bronze walls, dripping mineral statues, and “translucent statues that sang” constrain the ritual physically and emotionally in the final image. Early spatial orientation is complete, and the environment itself reconfigures to mirror release, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to unbind the grotto’s sorrow”—is consistently signaled; pressure tightens through accumulating mineral statues. Agency is meditative rather than peril-fraught; calcifying each burden counts as escalating step but lacks a visible or felt price beyond beauty—the final stillness reads more as gift endured than option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting interior weight into literal light emerges quietly from concrete ritual; final sunrise glow reweights earlier sorrow without sermonizing. Subtext resides in motion: each drip’s calcification is unspoken metaphor for grief solidifying into art. Ambiguity lingers elegantly—reader must supply the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is uniquely lyric yet disciplined: “braided with patterns of light,” “kelp in a tide.” Compression is purposeful; patterned elision (“whalebone reverie”) is taught early and legible at closure cadence. Rhythmic control modulates with scene temperature—calm when carving statues, celebratory at sunrise flare—without obscuring line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical with only sporadic mild scaffold (“boundary-lessly trapped” label re-used twice). Information per sentence is high; fresh metaphors avoid muddle. Repetition serves rhythmic pattern rather than redundancy; syntax breathes with ritual cadence. Closure image crystallizes cleanly without overwritten haze.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mythic ritual with geological alchemy—grief calcified into singing statues—delivering specific wonder. Integration reads inevitable: bronze, shingled hush, and mineral statues cannot be swapped without collapsing atmosphere. Risk (lyric accretive structure) heightens resonance while holding narrative clarity.</comment>
