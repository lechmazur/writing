<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the resistance of memory”), but the cartomancer’s contradictory impulses remain muted; her final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of her discovery is only gestured at, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tape’s final fold and the droplet’s miniature universe crystallize her new stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the loft “breathes.” One minor drift: the causal link between humming walls and her grandmother’s song is asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The loft’s rain-beaded skylight and scarred brass tables are tactile and selective; the measuring tape itself becomes micro-setting that constrains her spiral tracing. The single clear droplet on the tape at closure recharges the entire sensory frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping hope from collapse—is signaled early and tightens through each measured loop. The final spiral’s break-point offers a visible narrowing of options, though the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited mystery and cultural rebirth emerges organically from the cartomancer’s acts; the final image of the folded tape as “silent promise” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the cards’ orange flares and the ledger’s fluttering pages is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the tape’s clicks. Compression and patterned elision (“the city’s pulse slowed to a tentative rhythm”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“perfume of incense and old ledger ink”) flirt with overwriting yet serve atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; final droplet image is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartomancy, crypto-collapse, and urban archaeology feels fresh and inevitable. The measuring tape as divinatory tech is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
