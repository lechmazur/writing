<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Liora's interiority remains abstract ("a quiet fire that urged," "latent blaze stir") without embodiment; prism-mindedness never translates to refracted internal contradictions. Micro-choices are missing except the final silent promise. Motivation is explicit but lacks texture, keeping arc tidy rather than contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure via seedlings-into-lamps is a subtle Resonant Reconfiguration paying the conceptual cost of perpetual vigilance; causal chain holds from doodle → threshold → seedlings → promise. Minor ellipsis (how she "instantly" aligns glyphs) is forgiveable but keeps the score under the 9-band.</comment>

<comment>Mist-shrouded serpentine path, floating stones, and inverted water generate atmospheric coherence; the seedlings now living in the atrium serve as constraining living architecture. Sensory specificity is filtered through Liora’s priorities; physical laws invert in exact image.</comment>

<comment>Single dominant stake—guard forgotten combinations—escalates as time tightens to the hour of inverted gravity. The reversal itself deepens stakes by exposing glyphs; cost is visible in the seedlings Liora must now eternally tend. One meaningful tightening is elegantly achieved, no superfluous reversals.</comment>

<comment>Emergent theme: vigilance is cultivation rather than acquisition, dramatized by the seedlings. No moral stated; cost of eternal tending is embodied. The resonance arises from the living lamps, not lecture.</comment>

<comment>Distinctly lyric, dense syntax mirrors archivist’s obsession; occasional “clandestinely luminous” repeat becomes pulse-word. No dialogue; interior register remains consistent but risks ornate overload.</comment>

<comment>Strong texture yet recurrent “latent blaze,” “seeds of vigilance” verge on mantra loop; “gravity turned upside down” could crystallize more vividly. Still musical, but minor redundancy dulls a line in the climax.</comment>

<comment>Conflates library archive with bio-living metaphor into fresh synthesis; inversion-hour as literal portal is archetype repurposed by prismatic cataloguer archetype. Specificity of luminous seedlings as living lamps makes premise non-extractable.</comment>
