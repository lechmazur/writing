<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “sharp-eyed dusk noticer” remains more archetype than individual. His contradictory impulses (regret vs. duty) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice—recording his own hands—earns a modest cost, yet the emotional weight feels generalized rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stone now “humming with captured shadows” reconfigures the library’s purpose. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored footage tightens meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library above clouds is evoked with selective, sensory strokes (“velvet cushion,” “stained glass,” “rain-kissed clouds”). The river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving hope via recorded memory—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: the mirrored footage tightens the pattern, forcing the act of recording his own hands. Cost is conceptual (loss of anonymity, luminous regret) and legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-hope emerges through the footage loop and stone’s glow, never sermonized. Final image of the kite “forever unbound” offers non-literal resonance. Subtext is carried by gesture and object rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“soft perfume of rain-kissed clouds”). No dialogue; free-indirect texture sustains POV. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“watercolor skies,” “ribs of a great wing”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or pressure. One mixed metaphor (“luminous regret melt into gratitude”) slightly blurs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Concept of a cloud-borne library archiving shareable dreams feels fresh, synthesized through specific sensory detail. The footage-mirroring device is non-obvious and integral. Risk-taking (lyric density, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
