<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s diligent curiosity is vividly embodied through tactile close-work at the chart table and micro-choices with the hopscotch board; each annotation and chalk route manifests her traits. Interior contradictions surface—wonder vs fear of draining the ship—and propel the final act. The earned stasis feels credible: she succeeds yet recognizes the cost of tethering living light. Minor over-reliance on labels like “quiet pride” keeps it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure image—the silver threads binding to copper veins—delivers a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. Cause-and-effect linkage is tight: phrasebook crumbs → hopscotch pattern → stray halo → engine sync beats all pay forward without causality drift. Cost is visible: the airship’s ‘own life-force’ now visibly shared. No orientation debt or late-rule drift. Falls one tick from 9.0 only because engine sync moment feels fractionally summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<comment>The airship’s brass hull, copper veins, and lantern-cast halos are not backdrop but mechanisms guiding choices. Spatial anchors hold early; the hopscotch board becomes micro-setting that literally constrains final routing. Sensory layering folds into thought rather than exposition. One minor white-room stumble—“cabin filled with the sociable isolation”—abstracts rather than locates. Otherwise, specificity drives plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping a beacon light without bleeding the ship—lands early and tightens through each beat: deciphering phrase, aligning squares, risking overdraw of power. One meaningful deepening occurs when Sumerian ‘to bind’ implicates the vessel itself. Cost is legible: “warm presence” signals life-force mingled with craft. No reversals but escalation accumulates by density within the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges non-didactically: the ethics of using living light to light future paths. It grows from image rather than assertion—the halo pulsing with starling murmurations outside. Final threads reweight prior motif without moral speech. Slight nudge down for the sentence “chart the next great discovery,” which edges toward statement rather than compression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is textured and character-specific: “starling murmurations outside the portholes” is filtered through a map-maker’s gaze. Syntax modulates from long lyrical sentences to clipped fragments under final pressure. No POV slippage; compression is taught quickly (“lumina cæli”). Occasional elevated diction (“polyglot’s phrasebook dog-ear”) balances antiquarian register, but once slips into slightly external summarization during engine sync (-0.2).</comment>

<grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies deftly; propulsion is high. Phrasebook crumbs, chalk traces, and copper vines are precise nouns with one-word verbs driving forward. Few loops: “the ship’s… ship’s… ship’s” cluster (-0.3) just before engine beat but does no clarity damage. Figurative language remains coherent and grounded rather than overwritten.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Fusion of antique airship, polyglot illumination, and living starlings feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesizes exploratory cartography with near-magical engineering without gimmick. Specificity of Latin–Sumerian–Swahili triad anchors cultural breadth. Slight risk-aversion: keeps narrative within familiar steampunk rather than venturing further afield (-0.2).</comment>
