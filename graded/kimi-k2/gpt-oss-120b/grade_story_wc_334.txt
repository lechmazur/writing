<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Folklorist’s curiosity is credibly obsessive but mostly descriptive; final memory-restoration choice is felt as inevitable, though her interior stakes peak early and stay flat until climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: seawater recedes and saplings reappear; fairy-ring constellation reweighs the village memory pool. Causality sustained under textured lens across one meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Ghost greenhouse and encircling wrecks are vivid, selective, and physically constrain movement; broken sextant and kelp scent anchor time and tension. Slight over-reliance on amber sunset refrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover memories—clear from first line. One escalating beat when floodwater visibly retreats; cost translated into revealed orchard and communal chant beneath wrecks. No secondary reversal, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theft and reclamation of communal memory refracted through orchard resurrection avoids overt moralising; final image crystallises theme via living archive embodied in glowing fungus chorus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Third-person lyric compressed but sustained: folklorist’s perceptual signature filters every sense. Rust, brine, and spore are rendered with musical rhythm and purposeful repetition. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose sings while staying information-dense; only occasional “amber light” loop flirts with excess. Syntax varies, momentum clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Lighthouse-ring-fungus-archipelago conceit feels fresh, yet retains recognizable folkloric resonance; transformation into memory-constellation sextant is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
