<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“simply complicated” mind, luminous pollen on skin), but the curator’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure until the final press of the cameo. The surrender of linear narrative is declared rather than dramatized in scene. Cost is felt but diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cameo projects a constellation map, reweighting inheritance from line to loop. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dissolving questions and starlight reassembles. Orientation is taught early; causality is lyric, not linear, yet coherent under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is luminous and specific—floating trees, pollen, bathroom tiles rearranging into mosaic—yet never constrains a tactical choice. The orchard’s rules remain ornamental; final star-map is projected onto, not shaped by, the asteroid. Vivid but not choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—inherit nonlinear knowledge—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: surrender linear life to receive map. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible forfeiture on page. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of recursive knowledge emerges through image and action, not statement. Final constellation map offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in bathroom whispers and pollen-shedding is effective. Avoids tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured (“luminous grove,” “pond of starlight”). POV remains stable; perceptual signature is curator’s bewildered awe. No dialogue to test. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“pond of starlight,” “network of moments”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. Rhythm modulates with pressure. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of astral orchard and pistachio-shell key is fresh; nonlinear inheritance handled as lived paradox rather than gimmick. Specificity of bathroom epiphanies and pollen inheritance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds.</comment>
