<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her sensory maps and the shard’s pulse are felt in her body. Motivation (uncover withheld truth) is clear and escalates to the decisive act of freeing the crew. The final renunciation of the shard’s power carries visible cost: the bay’s walls dissolve and the shard itself is lost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the two timelines are stitched together, the crew awaken, and the shard is scattered—cost is the loss of the tool and the irreversible merging of realities. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory map layer and shard pulse increases density until the final light-cascade reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when the log entry forces the choice to awaken the crew.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The repair bay’s rusted hulls, flickering fluorescents, and cracked floor are selective and POV-filtered. The green shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it alone can redirect sensory flow and is ultimately destroyed. Spatial choreography is coherent; the bay’s warmth after awakening is a felt environmental shift. Meets 9+ gate: the shard charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover and release the withheld truth—is signaled early and escalates when the log entry reveals the commander’s betrayal. One decisive tightening: Lira chooses to awaken the crew, foreclosing her ability to return unchanged. Cost is the shard’s destruction and the irreversible merging of timelines. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of hidden knowledge and the responsibility of the mapper to intervene. Subtext operates in the shard’s whispered possibilities and the crew’s suspended breath. Final image—star-like glass drifting across a newly woven tapestry—offers a non-literal answer about shared truth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “cyclically spontaneous” promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “rivers of light,” “glass-bottle breath,” “cyclically spontaneous pulse.” Perceptual signature is character-specific—Lira notices pressure, echo, and refracted photons. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV lexicon. Rhythm modulates with tension, accelerating during the shard’s redirection. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and patterned early (“lattice of possibilities,” “weaving between worlds”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm tightens during the climax: “I raised the green shard high…” Final line recharges “murmur of half-remembered dreams” with new weight. Minor elevated diction (“cartographic ribbons”) fits the sensory-mapper POV.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—sensory cartographer using a prismatic shard to navigate parallel evacuations—is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes (abandoned spaceport, hidden log) are transformed through Lira’s synesthetic mapping and the shard’s literal fragmentation into stars. Synthesis feels inevitable: the withheld truth is both historical and multiversal. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
