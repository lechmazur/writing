<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Courier is credibly anxious, interiority vivid; shepherd & girl momentarily distinct. Mentally anchored choices resonate (“quickened his pace”) but no deep contradiction pushes final decision, so closure feels mild earned stasis rather than hard cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single scene holds; causal bead is courier → pendant → shepherd → girl → onward. Orientation anchored by aurora & ridgeway within first 120 words. Closure is earned Charged Poise: courier continues, now knowing small wonder works. Cost implied by vanishing mentor & solitary path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Environment (aurora-lit ridgeway, firepit, mist) is tactile and shapes travel constraints. Micro tool (pendant) becomes mobile altar; physical heat of pendant constrains heartbeats. Consistency holds; landscape feels lived in.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is to germinate wonder before mentor’s ethos fades. Pendant’s vibrations give agency; each activation tightens by using another chance. Cost is felt via pendant’s fading glow—one less miracle remains. Escalation is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without didactics: brief encounters extended into myth. Emerges through shepherd’s laughter, girl’s map, courier walking on—no sermonizing. Final image reframes ridgeway as legend-laden pilgrimage trail.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person free indirect flows with courier’s nerves; sensory diction is consistent and rhythmic. Phrases like “fluttering like captured sunrise” keep voice coherent. No head-hopping, no register shift.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences shimmer with motion (“thumping”, “germinate”, “vanished into the aurora’s glow”). Minor loop in repeated “aurora” usage but rhythm varied. Clean comma splice once but clear; clarity preserved.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Fantasy courier trope refreshed: mentor’s voice as absent refrain, wonder-amplifying pendant as new slant on wish-gift. Specificity in auroral ridgeway adds freshness. Premise would survive retitling but local details matter.</comment>
