<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clock maker’s interiority is vivid—his “bleak exhilaration” pulses through embodied choices—but the final vanishing feels slightly unmotivated; no prior beat shows him relinquishing human ties, so the cost reads abstract rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the beacon ignites, reconfiguring fate for islanders and self. Causal chain (yoyo → gears → light) holds; only minor drift is the off-stage sailor beat that dilutes single-scene focus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse stones, spray, and copper-veined yoyo ground every move; the beacon’s final flare is inseparable from the cliff’s teeth. Micro-setting (stone floor, lantern room) constrains the key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“step beyond fate”—is signaled early and tightened when the engine coughs alive; the visible price is the hunger stone’s dimming. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting destiny emerges through yoyo-cipher and reversed time, not statement. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the sailor coda slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is tactile and rhythmic—“slow exhale of low tide,” “iron teeth grinding”—with consistent lyric compression. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the clock maker’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“bleak exhilaration that pulsed”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold in final third; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Counter-clockwise engine, yoyo-cipher, and hunger-stone conduit synthesize into a fresh mythic engine. Risky lyric structure pays off; premise feels inevitable yet non-derivative.</comment>
