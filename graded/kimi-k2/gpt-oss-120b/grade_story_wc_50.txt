<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Corin’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingertip tracing, the “quiet triumph,” the inward turn on the paradox of capture—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; no single moment shows simultaneous conflicting impulses under pressure. The final stance (library not prison) is earned by prior causality yet feels gently intellectual rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the timer’s restored pulse reconfigures the cavern’s echoes into stored wonder, crystallizing a Charged Poise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflection angle and polished plate adds density until the final cadence shift. Cost is felt in the jars’ soft hum, a visible constraint that will outlast the season.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its veins guide Corin’s fingers, its fissures supply light, its dome height sets the sun-angle that triggers the harvest. The phosphorescent moss and bronze plates are micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image when starlight dances across the crystal timer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture wonder without imprisoning its source—is signaled early and tightened once: the timer’s first shiver pulls echoes into the jar, foreclosing the option of leaving them wild. The price is the quiet, ongoing labor of tending new jars, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the ethics of archiving wonder versus letting it roam. The final image of starlight on crystal reweights the premise—storage as stewardship, not possession—without moralizing. Subtext lives in the hush between hum and heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is reflective, lapidary, consistent; perceptual signature filters every beam of light through Corin’s locksmith logic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for contemplation, clipped fragments at the moment of insertion. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image and idea without redundancy. Occasional lyric elevation (“tide of whispers”) is earned by pattern and payoff. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of harvesting echoes with a reverse-engineered timer feels fresh, grounded in tactile procedure rather than gimmick. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative structure; it pays off in a resonant final image that could not be transplanted unchanged.</comment>
