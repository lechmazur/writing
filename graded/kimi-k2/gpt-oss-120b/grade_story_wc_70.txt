<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s involuntary truth-telling is embodied in her trembling voice when she reads the riddle aloud, but the trait never forces a costly micro-choice; her confession to the drone is redundant because the drone already knows. The interior contradiction is hinted at (hope vs. fear of silence) yet never enacted in a beat that alters tactics. Closure is earned through realization rather than a decision that costs her anything visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tower’s revival and the drone’s return reconfigure the city’s soundscape and Mara’s understanding of “failure.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned images (bells, amber veins, echo) tighten until the final pulse. Cost is felt in the confession of lost wonder, though the price is conceptual rather than personal. Orientation is secure within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower’s glass rods and amber veins physically constrain the climax; the lacquer box’s oily sheen recurs to cue memory and action. Sensory selection (silver bells, honeyed light) is filtered through Mara’s caretaker bias. Micro-setting—the matchbox in her palm—functions as pivot object. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the key turns: the tower’s hum returns, foreclosing the option of permanent silence. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals required. The cost is conceptual (accepting the pause as echo) rather than visceral, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mechanical precision and organic wonder; the drone’s silent pulse answers the riddle without moralizing. The final image of “electric nectar” reweights the earlier “loss” as latent possibility. No thematic echo in dialogue; ambiguity lingers healthily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Mara’s sensory labor: “tasting the nectar dusk.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. No POV leakage; drone’s interiority is left opaque. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Minor loop risk in “hovered…hovered” is offset by rhythmic purpose. Metaphors (amber veins, honeyed light) cohere. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. One mixed moment—“wound on the city’s heart”—is brief and doesn’t cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of blackout aftermath, drone-hive elegy, and bell-toll ritual feels fresh; the “echo” reframe is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of the lacquer box and brass key anchors the fantastical. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring causality. No close echoes of prior published scenes.</comment>
