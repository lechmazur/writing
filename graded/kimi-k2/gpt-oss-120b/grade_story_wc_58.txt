<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is mostly atmospheric and thematic rather than action-forcing; traveler’s motives are visible but don’t tighten into concrete micro-choices, so credible change feels summary rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens is clear—the golden thread reappears late to revive the rose, creating a decisive change with felt cost. Compression and mystic ellipsis teach early, and the final reconfiguration lands on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Garden’s damp amber scent, fallen-leaf texture, and wilted rose are selectively vivid; the setting reweights the closure when threadlight makes the dead rose bloom again, fulfilling micro-setting as constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake is the mapping of healing; pressure tightens as shadows whisper absent lives, but escalation is more plaintive than sharply causal, narrowing options late without a visible price tag.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “geography of healing” stays emergent: absences charted through ink and thread reconfigure meaning when traveler revives the rose. Final charged image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is richly sensory and lyric with rhythmic control; occasional drift into abstract poetics stays consistent with the introspective POV, and no head-hopping occurs within single-scene window.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose carries deliberate lyric density; odd string of metaphors sometimes crowds clarity, but patterns teach their rule early and pay off darkly at revival beat. Minor loop penalty for stock phrase repeats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical elegiac mashup of living obituary and garden resurrection offers subtle twist that feels inevitable in hindsight; emotional specificity beats novelty. Risk taking registers without gimmickry.</comment>
