<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Philosopher’s mechanical arm is vividly tactile, but interiority stays abstract; diplomat’s “diplomatically fierce” remains label. Their final bow is graceful yet unmotivated by prior micro-choices, so the earned cost feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—question becomes destination—yet the causal chain from sundial angles to needle-card revelation is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear; single scene holds; lens reads Accumulative/Textural with one deepening cadence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Glass atrium and brook function as reflective constraint, mirroring duel and stilling to cue focus. Sundial’s half-painted pigment and metallic hum of the arm are specific sensory anchors that charge the final alignment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning question into destination—is signaled early and reweighted at close, but escalation is more lyrical intensification than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: duel as lecture, needles as waypoints, sundial as silent geometry. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing, though resonance leans cerebral over emotional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured; patterned elision (“hidden overture,” “dignified chaos”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no register clash; perceptual signature remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, occasionally ornate (“constellations on a midnight map”) but never muddled. One paraphrase loop (“hidden overture… became the overt theme”) mildly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fencing duel as philosophical argument staged via sundial geometry and needle-card cartography is fresh synthesis. Risky lyric mode commits fully; transformation test passes—story would collapse if props swapped.</comment>
