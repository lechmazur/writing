<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her feisty spark and generational guilt collide in the orchard—but Mira remains a prop; the mother-daughter crucible never pressures a choice. The final “thank you” to the orchard is earned, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (leaves, light, chime) thickens until the repaired quartz reconfigures Lira’s purpose. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the world sharpened”—with the orchard’s sigh as felt cost. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The raftered orchard filters light like choir song, constraining Lira’s ritual bench placement and charging the final image. Spatial anchors remain coherent; cathedral decay and living canopy interweave without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending generational rupture—tightens when the ribbon snag triggers the quartz repair plan. One clear escalation beat suffices; the chime’s resonance marks the irreversible shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through fracture emerges organically from orchard cycles and quartz shards; the final image of “every fracture holds a seed” reweights prior vows without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Lyric, leaf-laden diction stays consistent; perceptual signature is Lira’s—she hears vows in rustling leaves, sees light as choir. No POV drift; compression in the mending sequence is taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) and one mixed metaphor (“bruised sky”). Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Quartz-eye guild, rafter orchard, and deciduous vows synthesize into a fresh mythic ecology. The breach-as-opportunity twist feels inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in lyric density, not gimmickry.</comment>
