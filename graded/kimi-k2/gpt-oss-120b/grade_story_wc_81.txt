<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s indexing compulsion is embodied in tactile micro-choices—aligning brass gears, noting ink hue shifts—yet her interior contradiction (rational method vs sacrificial myth) stays summary. The final stamp onto the slab crystallizes her values, but the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamped glyph reconfigures the city’s future and Mara’s purpose. Causal chain holds—cross-referencing charts leads to staged-flood hypothesis leads to vault discovery—though the vault reveal is slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The water-worn shelves, seeping cracks, and tidal-powered buoys are vivid and purposeful; the library’s architecture literally constrains every indexing move and ultimately houses the charter. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Mara’s methodical focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the city’s deliberate burial—tightens once when the alternative hypothesis is tested against the drowned scribe’s poetry. The cost is the city’s exposure, but it is felt more by the setting than by Mara herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed stillness emerges through the shift from chaotic flood myth to deliberate preservation; the final glowing slab reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silent pulse of the library and the faint glow of the stamp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is calm, precise, and perceptually specific—“water seeping through cracks altered the ink’s hue”—matching the indexer’s temperament. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; sentences advance both atmosphere and indexing task. Occasional elevated diction (“reclaimed stillness,” “mournful sigh”) flirts with overwriting but remains within the indexer’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The submerged-library-as-archive premise feels fresh; the antique stamp doubling as cipher and seal is an elegant synthesis. Risk lies in the quiet, cerebral resolution, but it pays off by reconfiguring myth into measurable truth.</comment>
