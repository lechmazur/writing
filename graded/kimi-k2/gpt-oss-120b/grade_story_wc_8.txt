<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is vivid—“emotionally rational” shows in how he weighs the letter’s glow against the ivy’s retreat—but the final beat is more epiphanic than earned; the shift from scholar to beacon-keeper feels declared rather than paid for in prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the letter freezes in sunlight, ivy loosens, and the station’s decay is conceptually repriced. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is rendered with tactile specificity—green veins, rusted mailbox, glass shards—and the ivy’s retreat under the letter’s glow constrains the final image, charging the closure with visible transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—tightens once when Arlen decides to display rather than conceal the letter. The cost is conceptual (loss of the protective myth) and felt in the station’s sudden warmth, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the parallel between the fabricated kingdom and the station’s own noble lie; the final image reframes both without moralizing. Subtext resides in the ivy’s retreat and the letter’s frozen glow—resonant, non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—Arlen’s perceptual signature filters decay through archival metaphor. No dialogue, so no drift; compression and elision serve the accumulative cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“cathedral naves,” “moonlit water”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure the closure beat. No loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The synthesis of historian, illuminated letter, and noble-lie theme feels fresh; the station-as-kingdom parallel is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in lyric compression, but coherence remains intact.</comment>
