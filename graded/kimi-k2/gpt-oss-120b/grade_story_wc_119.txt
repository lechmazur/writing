<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interior voice is vivid and obsessive, but motivation (“encoding life into a new key”) is declared rather than dramatized; final epiphany feels pre-wrapped rather than earned on-page. Tasty but one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Closure mechanism (paper dissolving into Fog-of-Truth stew) arrives in sentence sixty-three of the summary paragraph, not in scene decisions; causality chain is backward-explained. Elegant but teleported.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse, lantern, sea salt, and cupola coils are materially vivid, and the beam/sweep mirror is integrated into the spooky ink-flow choreography—that anchor pushes beyond ornament.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on smuggling encoded memories; pressure rises only once (cookie cracked → mist revealed). Escalation is textural, not structural—more fog than wind.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth-unsealed hovers like angsty perfume; it never crystallizes into a question the reader can weigh—just another moody secret whispered at a storm-chewed cliff.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is sibylline-pleasing but drifts into fortune-cookie apothegm loops; perceptual signature distinct, yet rhythm succumbs to storm-beat repetition. No head-hopping.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Gorgeous textures ride stock phrases (“crypt crackled,” “lantern flickered”). One metaphor knot drags (-0.3): “encoded breath” sounds poetic but lacks embodied logic under microscope light.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Lattice of cookie-microdot-mermaid-secret is inventive, echoing Borges-light; the accidental-prophecy motor flips into deliberate steering without feeling contrived. Worth the salt.</question>
