<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The navigator’s interiority is embodied and specific—“eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps” shows contradiction and flaw. Motivation to map loss is clear and drives every beat; the final smile is earned cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (soldering, lifting the censer) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes a sanctuary for reverse migration, cost paid in absorbed sorrow etched into copper coils. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of moon-phase pulses and deepening patina reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; every beat accrues density toward the final hum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Signal station, censer foot, and moonlit sea are vivid, selective, and constrain choices—antennae “like skeletal ribs” set tone, censer foot’s glow dictates engine pulse. Micro-setting (the cracked console, reclaimed wiring) functions as pressure. Final image of lanterns mirroring patina recharges the object and setting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping loss via reverse migration—is signaled early and tightens through each midnight call. One meaningful deepening: the engine’s roar on full moon forecloses retreat, crystallizing the stance. Cost is visible in the censer’s bruised dimming and etched names. Agency remains with the navigator; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of loss-as-geography emerges from concrete actions—soldering, recording coordinates—never stated. Final image of ships turning westward offers non-literal answer: grief must be traveled back through, not away from. Subtext in the censer’s scent and pulse avoids moralizing. Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“cracked hush,” “raw solace”) is taught early and paid off in the lullaby hum. Perceptual signature is distinct—navigator’s bias toward cartographic metaphor and metallic scent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Syntax modulates with moon phases, mirroring engine pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“invisible rivers across the sky” extends the maritime motif. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Final paragraph crystallizes earlier motifs without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of reverse migration as grief cartography is fresh and fully committed to; no template echo. Censer foot as compass for souls is transformed from religious relic to technological heart. Specificity of patched uniforms and reclaimed wiring grounds the concept. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
