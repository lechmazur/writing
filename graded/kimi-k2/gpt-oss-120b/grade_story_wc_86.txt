<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The negotiator’s guilt–driven memory of a “failed exchange that had cost dozens” is a guts-level anchor; present choices (untethering the rope, offering the box) directly metabolise that regret into action, an earned reckoning. Interior contradiction surfaces only as pensive delay, never riveting; still, the costly micro-choice—the rope released into mist—concretises the softening of the furrowed hush. Flaws are legible only in after-image, not in dialogue, but silence itself reads as temperament. The final act is an unambiguous renunciation of old chains that lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, single POV; moon-phase synchronisation and apology-forgiveness frame are anchored inside 100 words. Closure (Earned Stasis) is on-page: rope dropped, prisoners listed, shared turning point accepted—stakes shifted permanently. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of hush, pull, rope, moon tightens until the closing cadence crystallises a stance. Cost is visible in the rope’s literal fall and the negotiator’s untouched drawer-pull, “now warm from his palm.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm-slick parapet, sea-mist, waning crescent—all visceral and necessary; the weather dampens approach routes and matches emotional timbre. “Stones bare but no longer hostile” directly reframes the earlier chill, stasis gain. Antique pull functions as micro-setting that the hand warms, enriching final image. Missing 9+ gate—the setting never strictly constrains the actual prisoner release logistics—but credibility is tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether past error can be salvaged into a humane exchange. Stakes tighten when the rope is untethered and the pull accepted, foreclosing vengeance. Pressure remains existential credibility rather than physical peril—coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. A visible price is paid (symbolic liberation of self, practical loss of buffer rope).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Theme—recycled wisdom as bridge, not gift—emerges quietly from the list of names and the negotiator’s whispered words. No thematic didacticism; resonance depends on the reader completing the analogy. Stays grounded: specifics banish abstraction. Closure image re-weights motif without sermon—just enough to flirt with 7.2.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Furrowed hush and salt-tarnished metal create a cohesive lyric signature; “weight lift” and “mist dissolve” read as perceptual filtering, not narrator preaching. Grammatical obedience and lingering meteorological metaphor maintain grounding. No dialogue, so voice distinction irrelevant; interior voice remains specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is compressed, atmospheric, rhythm varied, if occasionally velveted: “storm-worn, windblown” feels stacked but earns its cadence. “Furrowed hush” returns thrice—not lazily, each instance recharged. Minor figurative muddle (“moon marked schedule”) but never at closure. Near-zero scaffolding; density high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Familiar prisoner-exchange frame transformed by lunar metronome and tactile apology ritual; antique drawer pull as hinge blurs tool and talisman. Stakes center on internal ethics rather than geopolitical muscle. Fresh inflection lives in the moon-phase negotiation mechanic and rope-as-constraint metaphor. Not groundbreakingly novel, but distinctively localised.</comment>
