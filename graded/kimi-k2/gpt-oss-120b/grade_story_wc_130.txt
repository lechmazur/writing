<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The conjurer’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives are stated (“to understand the mathematics of emotion”) rather than embodied in moment-to-moment choices. No contradictory impulses appear on the page, and the final insight feels gifted rather than earned through visible struggle. The glass-eye handling is evocative yet never forces a decision that costs him anything concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens; closure lands as Charged Poise when the orchard “shed luminous petals” reweighting grief into hope. Orientation is clear by 120 words; causality is loose but coherent under the lyric mode. Cost is felt as conceptual rather than tangible—acceptable for this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is rendered with tactile specificity—dripping stalactites, mossy ground, mosaic stone—each detail filtering through the conjurer’s focused attention. The stepping stone’s cracks and glass-eye placement constrain his ritual and charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss is the declared stake, but pressure escalates only as poetic accumulation rather than narrowing options. No visible trade-off or forfeiture occurs; the conjurer’s agency is observational. The final insight arrives without a beat that forces a costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief transmuted into hope emerges through image and cadence rather than statement. The glass eyes and orchard petals form a quiet conceptual repricing that avoids moralizing. Subtext is present but slightly diffuse; the emotional aftereffect lingers gently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and selective sensory focus that matches the conjurer’s contemplative stance. No head-hopping; diction remains within the elevated but plausible register. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language is patterned and taught early. Occasional soft loops (“softly spoken incantation… softly”) and mild density in mid-sections keep it from the 9-band. No clarity breaks or artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermy eyes, orchard mathematics, and emotional alchemy feels specific and memorable. The concept of grief-as-equation is not wholly new, but the cavern setting and glass-eye ritual give it a non-obvious inflection. Risk-taking is moderate; execution supports the vision.</comment>
