<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her bones register gravity’s tug, her breath steadies as she exhaumes memory; yet the back-to-back epiphanies at the end slide toward declarative insight rather than a last embodied cost, preventing full Earned-Stasis burnish.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral coffee-grounds → gravity pockets → slab spiral → wildflower activation forms a patterned crescendo that reweights meaning. Closure is rendered as Resonant Reconfiguration (“gleaming silence”) with conceptual cost palpable, but the wildflower-as-key arrives without physical seeding, creating a whiff of late rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Salt chamber, lantern brass, pressed petals, and gravity pockets are tactile and fate-bearing; the chamber’s low tide walls constrain posture and memory retrieval. Whale carcass and village loss remain evocative but off-screen, weakening spatial anchoring a click.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“where deleted memories go”—is announced up-front and escalates through each excavation beat. The spiral coffee-ground aligning the slab functions as on-page hinge that forecloses any easier search; gravity’s pulses and retrieved memories visibly extract a price.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Themes of forgetting, reclamation, and symbiotic loss emerge organically from salt, whale residue, and reclaimed light. Final image’s “gleaming silence” offers resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing, though the earlier repeated rhetorical question flirts overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Luminous, compressed lyricism sustains Mara’s perceptual signature; syntactic lulls mirror tidal breathing and gravity surges. Occasional drift into lyric cataloguing (“whispers what the sea had taken”) nudges register above her dock-side vernacular.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, rhythm modulated to sync with lantern pulses and floor tremor; metaphors remain physically accountable. One scaffold echo (“gleaming silence” twice) dulls final blade without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing gravity anomalies, pressed botanics, and deleted-memory archaeology yields an unlikely but inevitable synthesis. Whale-death as prism for cosmic archive feels freshly earned; chamber’s low-tide crystal as memory vault is non-obvious and specific.</comment>
