<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “burnished sorrow” and pocketed shard crystallize regret and hope—but the shift from observer to catalyst is slightly under-motivated; the elders’ softening feels externally granted rather than earned by her micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors’ frescoes rewrite cultural memory, cost paid in Lira’s lingering heaviness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, mirrors, shard accumulate until the final luminous veil reweights history.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The baroque asteroid’s copper spires and mirrored observatory are not mere backdrop; the mirrors’ cloth-covering ritual directly enables the climax, constraining how light rewrites the past. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether the shard will heal or fracture the community—tightens once when the mirrored rain transforms dispute into collaboration. Cost is visible: Lira’s private shard and the elders’ surrendered certainties.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-through-fragment emerges organically from the shard’s journey and the mirrors’ refracted histories; no moralizing, only the final image of “futures yet unwritten” resonating without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, its baroque cadences mirroring the asteroid’s architecture; perceptual signature is consistent, e.g., “burnished sorrow” recurs with deepening nuance. No head-hopping, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. Minor loop—“mirrors…mirrors”—is purposeful echo, not artifact. Rhythm modulates with storm intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—fallen revolutionary, crystal relic—are transfigured by the mirrors-as-canvas conceit and the Accumulative/Textural design. The asteroid’s gilded decay feels singular, not generic space-opera backdrop.</comment>
