<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interiority is poetic but abstract; motives are declared (“capture the density of presence”) rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulses surface under pressure; the group acts in unison without individual stakes. The final vow feels communal, not personally costly to him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing shell becomes a communal beacon, reweighting the premise from experiment to guardianship. Causality is light—friends mix breath into pigment, shell glows, vow is spoken—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Orientation is clear early; no scene break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Ember nexus at twilight” is evoked with iron-and-pine scent and rising coals; the shell’s pearlescent curve is tactile and later glows, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; bodies circle a shallow basin. Details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“will the glow anchor or dissipate?”—escalate only once when the shell ignites. The vow to guide travelers is communal, not personally costly; no single character’s option is foreclosed. Pressure is gentle, fitting the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of revaluing alchemy from profit to service emerges through the shell’s transformation and the vow. Subtext is carried by the shell’s pulse matching heartbeats, not stated. Final image reframes prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, elevated diction (“scientifically romantic,” “density of presence”). Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but unobtrusive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet clear; metaphors (“coals rose like distant stars”) serve atmosphere without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm modulates with the scene’s quiet intensity. Occasional abstraction (“poetry of transformation”) is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Alchemy-as-memory-light is fresh; the nautilus shell conduit feels specific. Risk is moderate—lyric science-fantasy—but the synthesis is coherent. Avoids cliché by grounding wonder in communal ritual.</comment>
