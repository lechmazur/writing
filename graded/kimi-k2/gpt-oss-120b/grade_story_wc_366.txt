<comment>Marek’s quiet diligence and sensorial memory are embodied through tactile ritual—the carvings, the pocketing of warmed glass—so interior contradiction feels alive. Yet his final “surge of purpose” edges close to an unearned epiphany; we see the ache, not the exact choice that prices that ache.</comment>

<comment>Select Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral ritual gathers density until the lamp-room’s silence is reweighted into communal sanctuary. Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the stone circle glows, the glass becomes talisman—clearly reframes stakes, though the cost pulses through image rather than explicit sacrifice.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lantern room’s cold iron ribs, cracked panes, and salt-flecked darkness function as micro-setting: these broken specifics constrain Marek’s method (he must stack stones on stone, not fix wiring) and charge the final luminescence from decay. Vivid, selective, tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protecting the anonymous letter chain—is signalled early and tightened by the dying lamp. Escalation is subtle but legible: as darkness swells, Marek’s stacking becomes the single live tactic, narrowing options to memory and weight. Cost: he shoulders custodianship rather than escape; the price is felt rather than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of carried safety arises organically from stacked stones and bottled glass; no overt thesis intrudes. The spiral’s pulse in darkness reconfigures “haunted” into “sanctuary,” offering a resonant non-verbal answer to the central question of how memory shelters the lost.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is consistent, quietly maritime, sensorial, and modest: “wind moaned through broken panes, the faint tremor of the lantern’s glass.” Rhythmed sentences glide from cold to glow without register drift; rare metaphor is purposeful (“luminescent ache of memory”).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured, sentences often dual-purpose (“the stone spiral glowed faintly, the sea glass refracting the ghostly light”). No loops or scaffold; repetition of “luminescent ache” twice across paragraphs edges redundancy but remains functional.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The concept—a stone ritual that materialises an invisible epistolary chain—feels fresh because it marries maritime folklore to tactile craft, grounding abstraction in physical gesture. The transformation of a haunted ruin into heart-lighthouse avoids cliché through sensory anchoring.</comment>
