<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrically rendered but drifts into generic spiritual language (“walls between hearts,” “chorus of quiet reverence”) that flattens contradiction. Her single decisive act—naming the lost—lacks prior micro-choices that show her risking personal exposure; the warmth in her palm is the only embodied cost. The shift from inspector to “keeper of light” is declared, not dramatized through visible stakes or error. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible is N/A; still, the arc feels safely hedged rather than flawed and tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pearl’s flare reconfigures the cavern into a “shared lantern,” cost felt in the released centuries of sorrow. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each confession incrementally brightens the pearl, pattern taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by line 6; no penalty. The final image is legible, yet the escalation is smooth to the point of frictionless—no tightening beat forces Mara to sacrifice or renounce a concrete want, keeping the cost more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: quartz walls refract light that guides Mara’s attention and ultimately crowns the ceiling, charging the closure image. Selective sensory detail—cool mist, lavender water—tracks with her slowed heartbeat, keeping description purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. While the bunker outside is named, the caves supply all necessary constraint; occupational detail is minimal but irrelevant to the ritual core.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external force opposes Mara, so pressure is entirely internal and static. The pearl brightens, yet Mara’s options never narrow; she faces no trade-off or risk of failure. The single meaningful tightening is the lavender shift after the first confession, a textural deepening rather than a forced choice. Escalation is present under Accumulative lens but lacks a visible price that alters her tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of communal grief transmuted into shared luminescence emerges through the pearl’s accretion of confessions, avoiding overt moralizing. The final halo image offers a non-literal answer: shared sorrow becomes guiding light. Subtext operates in the etched glyphs rather than dialogue. Some lines approach thematic echo (“dissolve the walls between hearts”), but the closing image reweights prior material without stating a moral, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person POV remains tight to Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: light, color, and temperature dominate her noticing, aligning with her ritual task. Rhythm modulates with longer cadences that mimic the “resonant hush,” taught early and held to the last line. No dialogue to test; free indirect style is clean. Occasional elevated phrasing (“latent radiance,” “luminous halo”) edges toward poetic register but stays within a disciplined lyric voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined: strong verbs (“cradling,” “spiraled,” “seep”) and sensory specificity propel the beat. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; each sentence adds texture or advances the ritual. Metaphors remain coherent—light as bridge, sorrow as vines—without mixed vehicles. One minor filter verb cluster (“she felt,” “she understood”) softens the climax, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bunker inspector with mystical pearl-crowning ritual is fresh; the contrast between bureaucratic title and spiritual task generates intrigue. Sea-monk backstory is hinted, not exploited, keeping mystery alive. The confession-shell mechanic particularizes the universal grief-to-light theme. While “crystal caves” and “pearl of hope” flirt with archetype, the accumulative confessions and inspector lens transform the trope enough to feel memorable rather than borrowed.</comment>
