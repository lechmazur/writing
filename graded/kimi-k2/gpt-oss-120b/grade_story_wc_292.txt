<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (hope/dread) are embodied in trembling fingertips and the “nervous grin,” but the ancestor’s bravery is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve feels slightly pre-packaged rather than earned by visible interior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mara’s choice to embed the nail in concrete is a Resonant Reconfiguration that costs her the chance to keep it portable. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—storm pressure tightens until the nail’s immobility becomes the new moral compass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The turbine chamber’s iron-and-seaweed smell and the “shaft of weak light” on the nail constrain Mara’s decision space; the weather station’s shudder under vortex pressure charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight, no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the ancestor’s story—escalates from cataloguing to sealing the nail in concrete; the storm’s low-pressure vortex is coherent pressure, not deus ex machina. Cost is visible: the nail is now literally immobile, foreclosing future retrieval.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-moral-compass emerges through the nail’s journey from archive to concrete; the coded stanzas reprise in the fresh slab without overt statement. Subtext in the turbines’ hum as answer to Mara’s whisper is effective, though the ancestor’s bravery remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent—“spongey dread,” “captured heartbeat”—with perceptual signature of a map librarian who notices “swirling wind charts.” No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates from cataloguing calm to turbine-chamber claustrophobia.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“coat stitched from hope and dread,” “syllable press against her spine like damp moss”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of climate-science station with ancestral relic quest feels fresh; reversible exile concept is lightly handled but not gimmicky. The copper nail as moral lodestar is a non-obvious synthesis that reweights the storm into ethical pressure.</comment>
