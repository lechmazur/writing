<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; contradictions shimmer on the page yet never tighten into a visceral choice beyond pledging to “guard” and “illuminate.” The donor-heart beats with externalized metaphor rather than embodied urgency, leaving the final stasis elegant but cost-adjacent rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Accretive pattern (“quietly explosive”) lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the valley’s world-rule reframes via loom-light at a conceptual, not causal, cost. Closure is coherent under an accretive lens, with every return of the blue wing deepening the reweight, though causality remains lyric rather than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The floating rock, amber mist, and loom of moonlight are sumptuously textured and tightly tethered to Lira’s perceptual lens; the loom’s pulse fuses setting and closure. Spatial ground remains stable; only the tea-house “hum” risks faint float.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why stories magnetize—intensifies through escalating density rather than external reversals; each sun-trail flare tightens the thematic focus to a Charged Poise. Cost remains conceptual rather than embodied, but the reconfiguration is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme of iridescent caution grows organically from image to image; the final loom-light reprises and deepens the metaphor without sermonizing. Complexity lingers: beauty is danger, but illumination must be dyed, not merely observed—a genuine conceptual reweight.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lira’s perceptual voice is distinct—glass-sharp seeing blended with synesthetic wonder. Rhythmed repetition (“glow… glowing… lights”) is intentional, taught early, and pays off in the loom’s cadence. No register drift or intrusive exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Sensuous imagery occasionally blooms into near-purple (“ribbons of light that danced”) yet stays purposeful and audible. Minor synonym clusters (“illuminated… illuminate”) appear but never stall clarity; closure line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The valley-rock-tea-house combo, donor-heart myth, and loom-moonlight fusion feel fresh, not conjunct. Each trope is refracted through Lira’s specific craft and poetic lens, creating a singular mythic tone without gimmickry. Only slight brush-stroke familiarity of “shimmering warning” keeps it from perfect.</comment>
