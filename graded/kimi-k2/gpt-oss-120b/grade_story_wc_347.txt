<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“ash on my tongue”), but the caretaker’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final renunciation is felt yet causally under-motivated by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s sigh and retreating frost crystallize the cost of endless repetition. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each reed impression layers pattern until the final shimmer reweights the curse. One minor ellipsis—how the nut’s warmth is known—does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and hollow stump are rendered with selective sensory detail; the stump-as-altar constrains the final placement of the nut and charges the glowing roots. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—guiding travelers before frost—tightens through the ticking clock; the caretaker’s agency is renunciation rather than rescue. Cost is visible in the orchard’s shudder and the caretaker’s empty hands, though the price feels generalized rather than sharply personal.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of graceless beauty emerges through concrete particulars: ash-fruit, mechanical lullaby, ember-nut. Final image of the wound-that-will-not-heal reweights the ritual without moralizing. Subtext operates in the birds’ amber gaze and the orchard’s reluctant sigh.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through caretaker fatigue (“memory of its latent heat”). Patterned elision—reed impressions only the birds can see—is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; tense and psychic distance remain stable.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; rhythm modulates with urgency. One paraphrase loop (“graceless beauty… jagged elegance”) and a mixed metaphor (“dying dragon” for frost) slightly dull the peak beat, yet clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar curse/orchard frame is transformed through mechanical birds, reed-impression cartography, and the blueprint-inside-a-nut conceit. Specificity of caretaker ritual and the wound metaphor create fresh synthesis; risk-taking stays coherent.</comment>
