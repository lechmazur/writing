<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria’s categorising clouds by emotion is a consistent lens for her interior; the quiet endurance at the end forecloses future flights and shows felt cost, yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: because/therefore linkage tightens as each classified cloud pushes her toward the final brass-tagged telescope image that crystallises the void’s memory; closure lands with visible, intimate price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The swaying gondola compresses to a reliquary of frayed rope and dust-lit cosmos, its height and confinement narrowing choices; the midnight horizon re-weights with weeping nimbus, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Loneliness rises with each cloud audit; the brass telescope itself delivers a measured deepening when inscribed feelings become the closure, but escalation arrives late and single-threaded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quietly explosive night finds literal calm but conceptual detonation, re-weighting absence as archive; no tidy moral emerges, only a resonant ledger of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical compression, telescopic fog, and star-lit hush feel native to a meteorologist’s eye; each classified emotion is marked on the brass with a hush that charges the closure without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Occasional looped phrasing—‘broken strings humming a lullaby of spooled wholeness’—padding high-stakes ends, but rhythm stays atmospheric and lucid lean.</comment>

<comment>Cloud-as-mood inventory is fresh; absence memorialized through stargazer ephemera avoids stock tropes, though template phraselets and late rope reminder edge safer choices.</comment>
