<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stationer’s motivation to “collect textures of different times” is stated early and remains consistent, but his interiority stays abstract—no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion appear on the page. His single observable choice is to close the notepad and walk on; the cost is hinted at but not dramatized. The absence of a second character or status pressure keeps the crucible narrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of the labyrinth inhaling the lamp’s hum crystallizes the invented histories as “bridges” with felt conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light and silence layers until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the “when the town finally whispers again” beat is off-stage and dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is rendered with vivid, selective detail—“trunks twisted like whispered verses”—and the setting constrains movement, forcing the stationer along stone paths. Micro-setting (the silver birch) serves as seat and light-refractor, charging the final image. The environment subtly mirrors interior stillness without overt symbolism. A hairline slip: “bruised violet” sky edges toward stock palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving invented histories against silence—is signaled early and escalates through sensory density rather than causal turns. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stationer realizes these histories are “bridges,” foreclosing the option of abandoning the task. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a more tangible forfeiture would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of inventing memory to fill communal silence. Subtext operates in the humming lamp and pressed-petal weight of the notepad. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. The concept is coherent, but the absence of counter-readings or internal challenge keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent—“incandescent restraint” maintained through syntactic control and restrained metaphor. Perceptual signature is strong: the stationer’s noticing is filtered through paper, light, and resin. No POV drift or register clash. The risk of overwriting is skirted; only “bruised violet” edges purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Rhythm modulates with scene needs—long breaths at dawn, clipped notes at closure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to lean”) could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bonsai maze, fluorescent lamp, and invented histories feels fresh and specific. The premise is not wholly novel, but the execution through light-refraction as time-mapping is non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off without obscuring clarity. A touch more friction or surprise would elevate it further.</comment>
