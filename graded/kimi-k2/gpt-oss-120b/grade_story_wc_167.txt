<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—watching mist fracture into arguing colors refracts her own conflict—but decisions remain observational rather than choice-forcing until the subtle dawn renunciation, keeping the arc just shy of explosion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: each ripple and refracted shard layers pattern and pressure toward the earned stasis renunciation. Closure image of nets turned crown reconfigures prior motifs with visible conceptual cost; causality holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is never backdrop; tide, glass, and weathered docks constrain Mira’s ritual timing and frame her final stance. Prism atrium mist evolves across beats, sustaining the noctilucent veil that charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—illuminating hidden worth—drives escalation toward renunciation without an explicit antagonist. Cost is felt in page-space cost of refracted wasted light and clothed nets; single tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Value of the mundane emerges through rhythmic ring/ripple motif; final crowned nets crystallize the theme without any overt moral declaration, offering earned meditation on hidden worth.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature of a glazier watching light split into colors, refracted through glass and water, is sustained and specific. Rhythmic compression under pressure—'quiet galaxies before everything shifts'—is taught early and paid off precisely.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Economy of rippling light, crowned nets, mist-veil galaxy delivers high information density without figurative muddle; no loops, zero scaffold. ‘Render sunlight a jeweled crown’ crystallizes image without excess.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of glazier noticing optical refraction to extract hidden worth is non-obvious; risk lies in lyric elevation that still obeys causality. Final crowned nets feel inevitable from first ripple.</comment>
