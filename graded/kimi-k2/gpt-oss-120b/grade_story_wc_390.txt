<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—logic vs. music—drives every beat; her embodied tremor at 432 Hz and tear at the end show cost. The “logically emotional” trait is dramatized, not labeled. Only minor slip: the council’s off-stage hand-off weakens status pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s hum reweights the world and Elara’s purpose. Causal chain (key → drum → vault → cradle) is tight; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the tear and the lighthouse’s new, unending vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop; its shivering floes literally answer the 432 Hz chord, constraining the unlocking beat. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Final beam painting the ice recharges the opening sunset image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the Heart from weaponization—is signaled early and tightened when Elara calibrates the cradle to speak only to the ready. One clear escalation: the vault’s runes demand her heartbeat’s sync, narrowing options. Cost is the perpetual guardianship she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through engineered compassion emerges from concrete acts (copper coils, cradle calibration) rather than statement. Final image of beam and hum offers non-literal answer: absolution is conditional and ongoing. No moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise technical diction braided with lyric cadence (“storm-tossed sky,” “fleshly ethereal glow”). Perceptual signature stays consistent; no head-hop. Compression (“logically emotional mind”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. One minor loop: “the sea’s sigh now a lullaby of redemption” echoes earlier phrasing without new pressure. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud rhythmic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic engineering meets sacred artifact in an ice-bound lighthouse. Tropes (chosen guardian, magical crystal) are transformed through specific material detail (432 Hz, copper cradle). Risky lyric mode stays legible and earned.</comment>
