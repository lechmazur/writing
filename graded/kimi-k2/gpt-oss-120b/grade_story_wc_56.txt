<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction (“serene upheaval,” “architecture of lies”) without embodied contradiction; the sundial use is a clear micro-choice that aligns motive and action, yet the final resolve feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seeker’s stance toward salvaging truth crystallizes with felt cost—the city’s spires now read as measurable lies. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the dawn image reweights earlier motifs. Minor drift: causality between lock-opening and cathedral insight is more associative than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twilight canal, rusted lock, and brass sundial are vivid and selective; the sundial constrains the decisive repair beat and reappears charged in the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; water and light mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging truth from lies—is signaled early and deepens through the lock-opening beat; the sunrise reconfiguration tightens the cost of continued seeking. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external opposition; one meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of dismantling inherited falsehoods emerges organically from the seeker’s tactile interaction with the lock and sundial; final image reframes the city as “question marks” without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and reflection rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific; patterned elision (“the silence of morning radio”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter verbs and maintains POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; occasional poetic overlay (“calm storm of purpose”) edges toward overwriting but does not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; metaphors remain coherent. One mixed metaphor (“sandcastles…grain shining thoughtfully clear”) mildly blurs physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar quest frame is refreshed through the sundial-as-key conceit and the metaphor of lies as architecture. Specificity of canal mechanics and brass calibration grounds the mythic premise; final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
