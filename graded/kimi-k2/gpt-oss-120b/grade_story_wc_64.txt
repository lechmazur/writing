<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gardener’s interiority is lyrical but thin; we feel his “blitheness” more than any contradiction. The moment he traces the circle with his thumb crystallizes motive and cost, yet prior beats lean on abstract “intentions” rather than embodied tension. Still, the final renunciation—sealing the case with a promise—earns its quiet weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the circle traced on the map reweights memory itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the copper glow answers the gardener’s question. Cost is felt in the hush that follows the wind’s “quiet applause.” Minor drift: the chess-clock beat is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, sovereign case, and velveteen gloom are rendered with selective, tactile detail; the silo’s pulse and the case’s brass hinges constrain the ritual. Micro-setting (the case’s compartments) functions as geography. One slip: “cobalt silo under stars” is vivid but never interacts with the gardener’s body after introduction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the shape of intentions—tightens once the tapestry thread reveals Marlowe’s true motive. The gardener’s choice to preserve rather than expose the map narrows his path. Pressure is textural, not causal; the escalation feels like deepening resonance rather than rising danger. Cost is oblique but legible in the sealing gesture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intention as circular, seed-like, never weaponized. The tapestry’s frayed border and the glowing circle embody this without sermon. Final image of the case as “compass for future gardens” reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the “velveteen gloom.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and compressed; perceptual signature favors hush, glow, and thread. Syntax modulates with emotional crests—short pulses near the circle-tracing beat. No dialogue, so no register drift. Occasional poetic elevation (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) risks purple, but pattern is taught early and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image or stakes. Metaphors (“lover’s embrace,” “copper hue”) are purposeful and paid off. Minor loop: “velveteen gloom” appears twice within four lines. No clarity breaks; rhythm breathes at closure. Meets high-band ear test.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs—cemetery, tapestry, hidden map—are transmuted through the gardener’s quiet ritual and the silo’s sci-fi intrusion. The synthesis feels inevitable: memory-work as gardening. Risk lies in the lyric mode itself; it succeeds without gimmickry. One near-echo: sovereign case resembles other “memory boxes,” but its brass specificity rescues it.</comment>
