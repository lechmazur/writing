<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her palm cradling the tooth, the ache softening—but the “modestly fearless” label is asserted rather than tested; the final renunciation (leaving the glowing tooth) is earned yet feels lightly costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s laughter reweights every prior sorrow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the cadence shift at sunrise. Cost is legible in the relinquished tooth and the lingering ache.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is more than backdrop; its stone walls, slick stones, and liquid-amber water constrain movement and mirror Mara's shifting state. The crocodile’s tooth functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn grief into mirth—is signaled early and tightened when Mara risks her own ache to release the joke. One clear escalation: the joke’s burst forces the luminous laughter that reconfigures the gorge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sorrow transmuted by laughter emerges organically from the gorge’s spectral confessions and Mara's embodied choice. Final image of joyous hum offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara's tuned grief. Patterned elision (“modestly fearless”) is taught early and paid off in the final relinquishment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“sunrise glass,” “liquid amber”) flirt with overwriting. Rhythm accelerates under pressure; no loops or scaffold in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope of spectral confessions is refreshed by the misaligned harp and the goat-choir joke. Specificity of the crocodile tooth and gorge acoustics makes the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
