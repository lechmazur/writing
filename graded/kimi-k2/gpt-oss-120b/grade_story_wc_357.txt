<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her trust in water-flow navigation and her awe at the inversion feel embodied. The moment she chooses to release the arrow tip into the basin crystallizes her shift from seeker to steward, paying the cost of relinquishing power. Yet the stakes of that renunciation could be sharper if we felt what she personally forfeits beyond mission success.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dissolved tip seeds perpetual renewal, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the orchard’s future. Causality holds—every beat flows from inversion physics to echo-guided search to catalytic growth. The only mild drag is the compressed backstory paragraph; its summary feel slightly dilutes the otherwise tight causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and phosphorescent roots are rendered with tactile specificity that guides Mira’s flight path and final choice. The basin’s upward swirl becomes the charged micro-setting where closure occurs. One more sensory anchor mid-scene—say, the scent of ruptured fruit—would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—securing the orchard’s resilience—escalates through the ticking hour of inversion, narrowing Mira’s options to seize or surrender the tip. The cost is legible: she gives up exclusive control. A crisper articulation of what failure would have meant to her personally would have tightened the screw another notch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical guardianship emerges organically from Mira’s choice to return the catalyst rather than hoard it. The final image of drifting particles reweights earlier echoes from mere mystery to communal legacy. A touch of overt wisdom in the penultimate paragraph (“resilience was a rhythm”) slightly flattens subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the growth surge and softens at release. The perceptual signature—rivers as silver veins, silence as a vortex—remains consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping or register drift; compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and scene-driven. Minor scaffold appears in “the planet’s own heartbeat” and “emerald fire,” but these do not stall momentum or muddy the closure image. Strong sentence variety and zero paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The inversion-hour ecology, echo-guided botany, and star-metal catalyst synthesize into a fresh planetary myth that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final dissolving tip, transforming a quest MacGuffin into ecological sacrament. No derivative templates detected.</comment>
