<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arlen’s “polished calm” is embodied through steady micro-choices (pinning currency, quieting Maya) and a final renunciation that carries felt cost; interiority is consistent, though the father-legacy thread stays more summary than contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Arlen pockets the euro and walks away, foreclosing the LoopForge path with visible cost (failed startup, abandoned train). Causal chain—markers reroute users, crash arrives, Arlen returns—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The circus train’s dusky amber light and rusted wagons are filtered through Arlen’s calm perception; the foreign bills pinned to cracked wood become the micro-setting that constrains the algorithm and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to guide wanderers without trapping them—tightens when Maya’s push for expansion meets Arlen’s boundary ethic; the crash crystallizes the cost, forcing Arlen’s renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges quietly: circles are tests of memory, not failures. The final image of Arlen pocketing the euro reweights the circus-as-loop metaphor without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Arlen’s calm, selective perception; diction (“dusky harmony,” “polished calm”) is consistent and rhythmic, though dialogue with Maya is brief and functional rather than textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“meteoric rise,” “universe’s method”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum or clouds closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusing highway-robber lineage with data-mapping startup and circus-train boundary ritual feels fresh and inevitable; the foreign-currency territorial markers offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis that deepens theme.</comment>
