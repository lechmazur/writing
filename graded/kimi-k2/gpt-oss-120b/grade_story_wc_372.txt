<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied (“precision of a surgeon cataloguing veins”), but the childhood motive is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost, yet the contradiction between duty and pilgrimage remains more stated than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s pulse reweights the premise, and the cost is legible in the ledger’s hum and the chief’s whispered vow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each measured frequency tightens the pattern toward the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen library, quartz hush, and glacial marble constrain every motion; the lantern’s glow becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful, anchoring orientation early and evolving with the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightened by each measured frequency; the final pulse forecloses the option of ignorance. Cost is visible in the weight settling on her shoulders and the corridor of meaning that replaces oblivion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus oblivion emerges through the lantern’s luminous vows and the ledger’s testimony; the final whispered vow offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext operates in silence and light rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“quartz hush,” “filament of story”—remains consistent and purposeful; patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No POV drift; perceptual signature is character-bound and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and never muddles causality. Minor synonym loops (“quartz hush” twice) do not obscure the closure image; rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Frozen library above clouds and vow-binding lantern synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, specific emotional crucible. The luminous-map closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
