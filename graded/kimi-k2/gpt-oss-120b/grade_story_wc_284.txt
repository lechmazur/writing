<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>His guilt-burned contrition is embodied in ash-scarred skin and ritual winter glyph-writing; but the shift from guilt to redeemed hope happens almost entirely in summary, reducing earned cost that would clinch 8-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rising pressure builds cleanly because/therefore along the snow-code trail toward the altar map, culminating in the RR of “unused courage is a state,” but the closure cost is stated more than dramatized, capping high-band at 7.2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Crags, bluff, crystal spring and silver hush are vivid and track geographically; the pillbox, the map-projecting altar, and melt-glyph slate constrain every tactical move, satisfying the constraint/closure link.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake “fix the shattered trust inside me” and external stakes “reach the hidden glen” weld as interior/external mirror; the narrowing valley passage and pillbox’s final burst tighten choice under cost, clear if slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Themes of redemption-as-courage emerge through snow glyphs and map-glow imagery rather than statement, with the spring tilt reweighting both environment and psyche in the final amber-fountain moment, yet the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, compressed third-person voice with crisp sensory diction (“pine-aired vial,” “fleeting glyphs”); silver hush cadence holds, though one or two elevated phrases drift slightly from spy idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control with no loops nor mixed metaphors; however, near-synonym strings (“broken…mended…shattered…healed”) and gentle pleonasm reduce propulsion a sliver at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Winter-snow map, redemption-via-courage, spy guilt sublimation are familiar, yet the fused snow-cipher-pillbox technology and the spring thaw reversal feel singular and inevitable by final image.</comment>
