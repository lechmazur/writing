<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“barefoot stargazer,” “awkward confidence bloom”), but the shift from passive listening to active leadership is asserted more than dramatized; the final vow feels slightly unearned because her prior micro-choices are mostly observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bay’s hum turns lull into steady pulse, cost felt in the workers’ reclaimed yet uncertain hearts. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of rising vibration reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Cracked concrete, rusted hulls, and the glyph-lit consoles are vivid and selective; the opera glasses and stone circle function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Environment guides action—she must align her pulse with the stone’s hum—charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and tightened when the stone’s hum forces her from observer to catalyst. One clear escalation: dormant engines cough alive, visible cost in the dust-choked air and workers’ wary return. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges through the stone’s song and the revived engines; no explicit moralizing. Final image of sunrise reflected in reclaimed hearts offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in the “thunderous serenity” phrase carries the paradox without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—constellation-patched jacket, “bruised sky,” “thunderous serenity”—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays tight; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“she whispered a question to the stone”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“key forged from starlight and steel”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops, filter-verb stacks, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with the rising hum, supporting the cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion-revival arc is refreshed by the barefoot stargazer’s mythic listening and the opera-glasses-as-conduit device. Specificity of the stone circle beneath a spaceport feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric mode pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
