<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifist stance and inherited blade skill create a credible internal contradiction; her micro-choice to offer a rose petal instead of a weapon crystallizes her values. The boy’s compass moment supplies relational pressure, but his interior remains off-page. Motivation (“weave continuity”) is stated more than dramatized; the final handing of the scrap to the elder shows earned cost yet feels slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s shared vow reweights the premise, and the scrap’s re-purposing carries visible social cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of quiet engravings and rose guardians builds density until the dawn image reconfigures hope. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (night→dawn) is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass dome, desert roses, and sandbag scraps are vivid, selective, and repeatedly handled; the scrap beside the fountain anchors the water’s pulse and later becomes a banner. Micro-setting (rose thorns curling outward) constrains the community’s defense posture. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and touch, filtered through Lira’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the perimeter walk.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the quiet hope amid ruin—is signaled early and tightened when Lira gathers the remaining scraps to reinforce the dome. One meaningful escalation: the boy’s broken compass forces her to convert a petal into a compass of purpose, foreclosing her own retreat. Cost is felt in the communal vow and the elder’s acceptance of historical weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of continuity-through-chaos emerges organically from Lira’s acts: whispering stories into roots, re-purposing ballast, handing petals. Subtext operates in the roses’ thorns glinting “like tiny swords sheathed in moonlight.” Final image of amber sunrise offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids overt thesis; ambiguity lingers in the quiet engraving’s unread words.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lira’s perceptual signature—“senselessly perceptive,” scent-weighted noticing, tactile focus on canvas fibers. Rhythm modulates with emotional rise: longer cadence in greenhouse, clipped fragments during scrap gathering. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture; occasional elevated diction (“inculcating plants with values”) slightly lifts out of register but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences often do double duty (“the roses responded, curling their thorns outward like guardians”). Minor loop: “tranquil blaze” recurs four times, but pattern is taught early and pays off in final sunrise. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs anchor motion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic oasis with pacifist botanist is fresh angle; roses-as-memory-keepers and sandbag-as-banner transform familiar tropes. Specificity of “amber glass” and “engraved quiet” feels unique. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in dawn image. Avoids derivative echoes; premise could not swap settings without loss.</comment>
