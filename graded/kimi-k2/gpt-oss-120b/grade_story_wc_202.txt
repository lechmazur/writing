<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens pulses through the entire arc; interior contradiction crystallizes in "I realize that my translation has become that beacon." Cost is visible—dissolving the fragment into communal memory. No secondary characters on page to test relationships; single-POV motives stay consistent. Interiority is vivid, but emotion sometimes drifts toward abstract proclamation, muting full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens fragment dissolves, communal memory rises—felt cost in severing the shard. Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout: pattern of clues hidden in paintings → tightening → cadence shift. Orientation is clear by sentence two, no penalty. Causality driven by translation act rather than reversal; acceptable under Accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory selection is selective and POV-filtered: “glass vials and brass constellations,” “wind tugging at the edge of my coat.” High aloft market becomes micro-setting that constrains movement via rope ladders, guiding the descent. Final rooftop glitter works as environmental echo. One or two phrases risk gentle abstraction, but setting fully charges the closing skyline image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring histories via fragment—reiterates early and tightens once the paintings converge. Escalation achieved through density increase and cadence shift under Accumulative lens; cost is lens fragment’s dissolution. No further reversals; single meaningful deepening sufficient. Agency is perceptual, framed as translation act rather than combative tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from imagery of remembered light and unfastened histories; final rooftop constellation answers the question of legacy without explicit moral. Some lines edge toward thematic summary (“intuition is anchored…”), but image-driven closure blunts the didactic drift. Layered ambiguity honors complexity. Subtext strong in the balcony promise to unseen sailors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, sustained second-person inflection with controlled diction; perceptual signature is distinct. Repetition of “lighthouse lens fragment” and “elusively tangible” forms deliberate pattern taught early and re-prices the closure image. Occasional surplus density in descriptive stretches dials back perfect rhythm, but no artifact touches the final sentence. Stance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose ear test passes: rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings switch. A few adjacent lines share syntactic templates (“when,” “as”) flagged under template-cadence, yet the effect reads intentional musical recursion rather than unconscious loop—score dock stays within bounds. Figurative language dense but purposeful; no mixed metaphors at closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise is fresh: rooftop alchemical market, between-worlds translator decoding pigment-coded memory. Synthesis of lighthouse shard, memory cartography, and communal archive avoids trope recycling. Micro-level risks with lyric compression pay off with earned closure. Bold choice of Accumulative escalation without antagonist earns bonus under risk provision.</comment>
