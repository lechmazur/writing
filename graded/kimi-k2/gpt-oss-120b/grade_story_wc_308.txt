<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the skimmer’s “weathered resolve” is stated more than embodied. No contradictory impulses surface in scene—she glides from reverence to mastery without friction. The pledge of continuity is a gesture, not a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered echoes and the arrowhead’s resonance tighten toward an Earned Stasis—she chooses stillness as navigation. Closure lands with conceptual cost: “the canyon seemed less a trap and more a teacher.” Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and integrated: towers of bone, basalt niche, cracked platform all constrain her stance. Micro-setting—the arrowhead on the rim—functions as pivot. Sensory hierarchy (wind tracing runes) filters through POV priorities. Final image of starlit lattice recharges the canyon’s memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens through escalating sensory pressure. One meaningful tightening: the pulse aligns with birds’ spirals, crystallizing the invisible map. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of motion) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuity versus stasis emerges from concrete particulars—arrowhead, pulse, birds—never stated. Final image reweights premise: stillness becomes active navigation. Resonant ambiguity lingers without moralizing. Subtext in “pledge of continuity” hints at unspoken debt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; patterned elision (“she stepped… yet her body seemed to glide”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature—heartbeat, wind, pressure wave—is character-specific. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays intimate. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Minor loop: “pulse left wandering” repeats with slight variation twice. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph achieves charged poise through syntactic compression. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—navigation by stillness via harmonic resonance—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of mystic canyon and ancient pulse are transformed through embodied practice. Specificity of “lattice of wind currents and echo pathways” anchors abstraction. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
