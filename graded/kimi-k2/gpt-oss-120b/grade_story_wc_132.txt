<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlowe’s interiority is vivid—his “circuitously sincere” smile and “sharp scientific curiosity” anchor him—but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final renunciation (stepping back) is earned yet stated more than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the leaf’s greening is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise; causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the middle beats feel slightly repetitive in their patient observation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mossy trellis, copper coil, and post-rain microclimate are tactile and selective; the greenhouse coda reprises the setting to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the leaf change?—tightens once via the mycelial bridge; cost is felt in Marlowe’s relinquished control, but the pressure curve is gentle rather than acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sustainable transformation through surrender emerges organically from the leaf’s slow shift and Marlowe’s practice; no overt moralizing, and the final greenhouse image reweights earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“circuitously sincere,” “quiet unfurling of chlorophyll”—remains consistent; no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature is botanically precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional stacked modifiers (“cool sheen on the mossy trellis”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of plant electro-culture and Taoist surrender feels fresh; the copper-coil nudge and mycelial handshake transform a familiar eco-parable into something specific and memorable.</comment>
