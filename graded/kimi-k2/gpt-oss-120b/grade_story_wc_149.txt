<comment>Only one on-page character; she acts consistently with her debt-driven drive yet her interiority hovers in lyrical reprise rather than concrete pressure-cooker moments. Motive is clear—'a debt forged in past life'—but micro-choices under increasing stakes happen offstage or are distilled into image ('she released a sigh'). Renunciation qualifies as earned stasis when she dissolves into blossoms; cost is implied, but character granularity blurs under layered lyricism.</comment>

<comment>The story aligns with the Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure deepens via repetitive acts of awakening (resonant notes, leaf unfurls). Closure image—orchard's luminescent blossoms—delivers Charged Poise that reweights the premise: love itself becomes venomous fertilizer. Spatial/temporal anchors are poetic yet coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when final breath is released; causal chain between bead, breath, and bloom is legible though lightly ethereal.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>No single object alone constrains a choice to meet 9+ sharp test, yet the integrated micro-setting (greenhouse membrane, frost, vine, bead) continuously pressures perception. Sensory density is consistent and distinctive ('metallic hymn', 'frost-bitten vines'). Spatial choreography never breaks realism. The greenhouse itself becomes a living character, charging final image but remains more textural than tactical.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repay love-debt across lifetimes—is signaled early and reweights with each resonance until transformed by final act. Escalation accrues texture rather than reversals: each ghostly note raises the cumulative cost until renunciation. No external antagonist; her own venomous affection provides coherent pressure that tightens when breath of roses seeds the soil. Cost materializes as her own erasure, felt and legible on page.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical redemption via love-into-venom emerges through concrete actions rather than didactic statements; 'mournful elation' is embodied in the orchard’s final glow. Ambiguity is controlled and emotionally honest. Final image reframes prior symbols (veil becomes ash, bead pulses alone) without moralizing. Avoids sermonizing by letting the blooming orchard provide wordless answer.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Vaguely mythic POV sustains a hypnotic rhythmic control throughout. Diction ranges from archaic ('kingdom fell') to visceral ('taste of molten hope') with consistent register. Filter verbs are minimal; imagery is tactile without syntactic overload. Voice specificity is strong; final cadence releases as exhale, matching the sigh in content and form. One of the cleaner lyric signatures under pressure.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is rich, occasionally ornate—'wind sang a low, metallic hymn'—but density remains serviceable; no loops or scaffold impede. One or two near-simultaneity glitches ('clutched a carved stone bead, its surface etched...") create small speed bumps. Few mixed metaphors; all are contained. Final line earns resonance rather than excess. Artifacts don’t touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Combines undead bride, alchemy orchard, and trans-generational finance through an emotionally grounded conceit without meta commentary. Transformation test: could not swap ghost, bead, or greenhouse without unraveling the core. Quiet yet bold risk sustains mythic lyricism while never defaulting to trope shorthand. Final ‘mournful elation’ reconfiguration satisfies without novelty theatrics.</comment>
