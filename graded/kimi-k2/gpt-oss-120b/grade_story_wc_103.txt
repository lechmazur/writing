<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s retrocognitive entrapment is embodied in her tactile design choices; the final “brushstroke on an ever-changing canvas” crystallizes her renunciation of static control. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, though the child’s brief presence lacks reciprocal pressure. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s seamless loop dissolves past/future boundaries and Mara accepts her role as witness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the vanished photographs and the garden’s quivering “promise of endless discovery.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but active agent: vines pulse to curiosity, mist carries memory, hyperbolic hedges warp perception. Micro-setting (halo fragment, fading photos) constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory economy is precise; spatial choreography coherent. Environment and tool jointly shape tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolve perception’s walls to feel time—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: photographs disintegrate into threads that stitch present to past, tightening the experiential loop. Escalation is textural, not causal, but pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is atmospheric yet legible in pigment-vapor and vanished images.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: memory’s decay and renewal, time as tactile fabric. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from the child’s wonder and Mara’s hushed gratitude. Final image reweights premise without statement. Complexity lingers—loss and renewal held in equipoise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that breathes with scene pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: “breath of ancient trees,” “sine wave leaves.” No head-hopping; POV stable. Diction stays within Mara’s designer lexicon; no register drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity replaces generics. Occasional elevated diction feels earned by lyric mode. Final cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise—maze that dissolves memory/moment boundaries—is fresh, synthesized through hyperbolic geometry and living architecture. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity anchors universals; no stock tropes. Transformation test passed: story would collapse if elements swapped.</comment>
