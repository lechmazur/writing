<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s shift from rehearsed survivor to active historian is embodied in her deliberate footfalls and the scroll’s weight on her shoulders; the contradiction between feigned and felt terror is shown, not told. Her micro-choice to “heal” after “remember what fell” crystallizes a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is specific, though the benevolent ruthlessness is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each traced word increases the density of memory until the scroll’s revelation reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira’s renunciation of grand narratives in favor of small gestures—felt in the penumbra’s protective curl. Causality is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s echoing arches and mirrored chessboard constrain Mira’s patterned walk, turning marble into mnemonic device. Light, dust, and shadow are filtered through her crisis-trained perception. The setting evolves from ceremonial hall to conduit for memory, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving erased gestures—tightens as each missing pawn’s absence becomes luminous. One meaningful deepening: the scroll’s revelation that small acts saved lives reweights the flood’s legacy. Cost is conceptual but legible; agency is hers alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: history’s scaffolding depends on the unnamed. Subtext lives in the penumbra’s pruning and the scroll’s slender lines. The ending’s quiet compass avoids moralizing, letting the luminous absence resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature is precise—“echoes linger like half-remembered prayers.” Syntax mirrors Mira’s deliberate tread. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on interior texture alone—clean, specific, unwavering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and motive. Metaphors (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) are purposeful and internally consistent. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the gallery’s breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>The synthesis of crisis-actor background with pawn-less chessboard and wandering shadow feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk lies in the quiet lyricism; it pays off in the charged final image. Specificity prevents cliché.</comment>
