<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poet’s desire to “discover the texture of time” is stated early and threads through every beat; the final binding of the rope to the stone is a credible renunciation that costs him the chance to release the escaped soul’s memory. Interiority is lyric rather than embodied, and the ethical playfulness is asserted more than dramatized, but the micro-choice at the fork is specific and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the poet binds the rope, foreclosing the path of release, and the cost is legible in the line “sealing the echo of the escaped soul.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layer uncovered reweights the rope’s meaning—though the causal chain is lightly sketched rather than tightly linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto is vividly rendered—“walls glistened like amber veins”—and the rope’s placement against stone constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent; the starlight and mineral glaze serve as both atmosphere and functional map. A few stock phrases (“baked earth,” “ancient murals”) keep it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve personal story vs. release collective memory—tightens at each fork and crystallizes at the final binding. Pressure escalates through pattern discovery rather than external threat, and the cost is felt on the page. The lack of an antagonist or ticking clock keeps it just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as both rope and thread, binding and releasing. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, letting the reader feel the paradox of preservation as loss. A touch of lyrical abstraction in the closing cadence slightly blunts the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and echo. Purposeful compression (“shadows painted ancient murals”) teaches the reader to read elision early. Occasional elevated diction (“terra-cotta grotto under starlight”) edges toward the poetic register but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; most sentences advance image or idea. A few stacked metaphors (“humming silhouettes,” “electric scent”) verge on overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts; minor register drift in “ethically playful grin” is forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cosmic energy beings with a frayed prison rope feels fresh; the transformation of a utilitarian object into a map of time is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The risk of lyric abstraction is mostly rewarded, though a closer echo of prior motifs would sharpen the payoff.</comment>
