<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The boy’s interiority is vivid—his mother’s lattice pulses against his palm, guiding each step—but the “cry wolf” backstory is asserted more than dramatized, muting the contradiction between false alarms and earned trust. His final choice to map the reef for others is credible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally searing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy’s legend flips from false alarm to guiding light, with the lattice’s glow charging the final image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat thickens atmosphere until the copperlight repose reweights meaning—though the map’s sudden 3-D bloom edges toward convenient magic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse prison breathes salt and damp; the copperlight on cracked tiles and the slick reef under bare feet anchor every move. The lattice itself becomes micro-setting, its etched prayers bending light to constrain escape routes, charging the final silhouette against the lantern’s beam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—redeem the boy’s name by guiding rescuers—tightens once when the map unfolds and bodies rise in grateful silence. Pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the cost is the boy’s acceptance of perpetual vigilance, felt but not viscerally sharpened on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: every warning is a thread, not a wall. The lattice’s shift from protective talisman to cartographer’s tool reweights the premise without sermon, letting silence after the hush carry the moral freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, its cadence mirroring the boy’s hush-chasing breath. Compression (“chasing hush,” “copperlight repose”) is taught early and paid off in the final glow; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative layering sustains the mythic register without clogging momentum. Occasional stacked modifiers (“copperlight repose settled on the damp floor”) flirt with excess yet serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>The cry-wolf heir who maps the drowned feels fresh; familiar tropes (lighthouse, reef, redemption) are re-wired through the lattice’s living geometry and the hush as tangible medium. Risk lies in the lyrical mode, but coherence holds.</comment>
