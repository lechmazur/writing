<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's ghostly presence is atmospherically haunting yet functionally vague; her choices do not visibly alter outcomes beyond poetic invitation. The interiority stays lyrical, but the motivational arrow—why she consents to tutor after death—remains abstract. The decisive change in the narrator's goal is credible: from decoding sigils to learning living stone language. Cost is felt, yet it is narrated rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A strong lyrical closure (“stitch the night's fleeting light into the brick's silent grammar”) delivers conceptual repricing with visible emotional cost. Causality is poetic rather than causal—accumulative pattern, not because/therefore. Orientation is anchored by meteor light and rooftop cues within ~120 words, safe. No break in logic, though the tutor’s existence drifts on soft fabulist rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, meteor shower, rusted rail, hummingbird feeder: each object or space echoes mood and subtly guides action (sugar exchange as trust). The desk seal constrains choice twice—first as token, then seal of pact—charging the final image under scope rules. Sensory layering is selective and purposeful, balancing the cosmic and intimate without clutter. Physical choreography stays coherent across the micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning stone language as living heartbeat—signal appears early. Pressure tightens through the mutual revelation that lies protect truth; escalation is cadence-driven rather than plot-driven, fitting accumulative lens. Coincidence (meteor timing) complicates intimacy but does not resolve problems. Final reconfiguration forecloses secrecy in favor of fluent dialogue, with cost felt in vulnerability. Meets lens without requiring external reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes around “language born of agreed-upon lies.” The rooftop garden becomes a cradle for both conspiracy and communion; the meteors serve as fleeting epiphanies rather than gimmick. Subtext of translation versus truth deepens through gesture and silence more than articulation. Final image leaves moral ambiguity without hand-wringing—a quiet reweighting of silence vs speech.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains a hushed, conspiratorial cadence distinct in diction and rhythm; “patiently nimble” texture in Liora’s motions and “murmurs embedded in brick and timber” demonstrate specificity. Slight POV modulation—“I felt humbled and newly fluent”—is a soft lens wobble but not head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (sugar shortcut) and resolve cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences glide with purposeful lyricism and tight variation; figurative risk is well-calibrated. One scaffold loop—“stone”—appears five times but gains new weight each iteration, functional rather than redundant. Minor drift in register with “decoding the murmurs” tilts academic, but the next sentence grounds with “borrowed sugar.” Ending line avoids over-writing.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Risk is high: a ghost language tutor holding rooftop séance lessons? Yet the grounded tea ritual, sugar micro-economy, and meteor strobe fuse into inevitable logic. Central conceit—lies as syntax—feels fresh and unborrowed, re-energised by specificity. The transformation of borrowed sugar into covenant is an elegant inversion of cliché hospitality.</comment>
