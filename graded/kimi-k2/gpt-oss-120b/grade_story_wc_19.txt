<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobic fear vs. hunger for sky—are embodied in the “stretching contracted” chest and the porcelain doll’s pulse. Micro-choice to limit exposure to one breath per silence shows value hierarchy under pressure. Earned renunciation: he returns underground with a widened heart, cost paid in the lingering scent of lost filaments. Only the mother’s smile feels slightly external; interiority stays strictly Lio’s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the doll now pulses with “gilded hush,” reweighting the bunker’s silence. Causal chain—gravity inversion → filament harvest → limiting exposure → pure retention—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by “dim corridors” and “narrow shaft” within 120 words. Cost is visible in the dissolving filaments and the warm porcelain heartbeat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The xenial trellis and inverted gravity are not postcard backdrops; they supply the literal platform and ticking clock that enable the harvest. Micro-setting of the porcelain doll functions as charged object-as-setting, constraining exposure time. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and taste of silence over visual catalog. Final image of corridors “listening” recharges the underground space with sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—collect pure flavors of silence—signaled early. Escalation: each filament risks contamination unless exposure is limited to one breath, tightening tactics. Hourglass of inverted gravity forces decisive micro-choices. Cost paid in the vanishing filaments and the irreversible warmth of the doll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme of vastness within confinement emerges from Lio’s embodied experience, never stated. The porcelain doll’s pulse becomes a non-literal answer: a sky can live in clay if the heart stretches. Subtext in the mother’s smile and the corridors’ new humming invites reflection without moralizing. Final image reweights earlier claustrophobia into resonant possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “breath echoing off stone like a trapped sigh,” “clouds brushed his cheeks like cool silk.” Perceptual signature stays child-bound, never editorial. Patterned elision of exposition taught early and paid off in the final humming corridors. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal and flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and world data. Rhythm modulates with gravity inversion—longer clauses float, shorter ones snap back. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Final line “ready to collect another flavor of hush” lands clean without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: harvesting silence as taste via inverted gravity and porcelain doll feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes of post-apocalyptic bunkers and sky-bridges are transformed through synesthetic specificity. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closure remains legible. Specificity of “sour bite of a market’s final bell” anchors universals.</comment>
