<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's drive to nurture skeptical minds is signaled, but her interiority veers into lyrical editorial (“forest of curiosity,” “queen”) rather than contradiction or micro-choice under pressure; we’re told she ‘hears’ but never shown a choice shaped by that gift. Relationships remain community-wide abstraction; no second character presses her stance.

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece is an accumulative/lyric mosaic; closure is Charged Poise via the synchronized lights and seed-planting wave. Transitions are legible, but several causal links (“the mayor opened the doors”) compress into narrative summary, softening visible cost; final image reweights meaning, yet the payoff reads announced rather than dramatized with on-page consequence.

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt library’s filtered gloom and reflective marble recur as tactile anchorage; “mist finally settled into breath” charges the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no prop state drifts. Atmosphere modulates pressure without sensory clutter.

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Central stake—cultivating communal second-thoughts—tightens once via the synchronized-window campaign that draws the mayor and citizens. Escalation is cumulative rather than causal turn, but cost is legible when quiet hush replaces noisy ambition. Agency remains collective metaphor.

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion against curricular certainty emerges through image of magnetic grotto and seedlings; it grows organically from scenes rather than explicit thesis. Final “quiet has spoken” dips toward editorial echo yet lands within the lyric frame.

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single collective lens sustained. Vocabulary evocative (“cobalt,” “grotto”), but rhythms drift toward syntactic parallelism in description: “dust danced like quiet fireflies,” “forests of second thoughts,” etc., flattening pressure. No dialogue used; narration retains perceptual consistency.

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are mostly clean; occasional cliché string (“dust danced like quiet fireflies”) loops imagery. One scaffold: “seeds a promise of second thoughts…” paraphrases the paragraph following: “seed a promise… garden.” Minor density loss near close.

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synchronized window campaign is fresh; familiar tropes of gentle uprising are re-cast through quiet, light-borne code. End image reframes the modest plot into collective transformation without gimmickry. Specificity outweighs abstraction.
