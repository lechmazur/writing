<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s calm acceptance of doom and her scientific ritual are embodied in copper coils and diary entries; she acts, decides, risks. Brazen calm feels credible, but moments like “will of the council lifted” lean declarative instead of costing her something visible. Interiority is specific—glyph murmurs root-to-rock—but the personal stake of her own mortality flickers while interspecies advocacy stays centre.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: the decree vanishes because the orchard’s living network has already metabolised time. Causal chain under Accumulative/Textural lens: each observation and coil increases density until the orchard itself stands as time’s defeater. One meaningful tightening when copper-resonance spreads to audience bodies. Costs are legible as six-month expiry becomes indefinite mutual stewardship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard is sensually locked through bark-grain diary sketches, mica veins shimmering with pulse, and faint chlorophyll exhalations. Living stone pillars act as micro-setting that constrains action—roots dictate where Mara can reach, copper height redefines what is possible. Spatial choreography survives; characters and tools track. Environmental detail charges the final image: glowing oaks and breathing stones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: use the countdown as leverage to renegotiate humanity’s relation with the non-human. Tightening occurs as each copper beat makes the orchard an organism that annuls the death sentence. External cost: six months of time; internal cost: perpetual caretaking as orchard conduit. Agency remains active until the last paragraph’s hush when breathing island refutes expiration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme is woven through images instead of articulated: copper as vascular tissue, temple stones as lungs, diary pages as xylem rings. The question—how to live responsibly with the more-than-human—receives its answer non-literally in the image of a woman whose body has absorbed the glow of oaks. Complexity maintained: no moral, only a witnessed transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: copper “humming faintly,” glyphs “whisper,” “bruised amber” coastline. Syntax modulates—long braided sentences ease into short breathy ones under pressure. No dialogue, but prose remains voce-persona throughout; filter verbs minimal. Final cadence crystallises without narration overtaking the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences carry botanical, mythic, acoustic data without clutter. Metaphor clusters stay coherent: copper = nerve, stone = vertebrae. No repeated scaffolds. Rhythm breathes under scene demands. One possible loop: “remodeled… remodel” mirrors but stays purposeful. Read-aloud texture satisfies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Speculative ecology fused with temple archaeology feels fresh and specific. Copper-biology interlink reworks both steampunk cable and Gaia myth. Brazen calm as aesthetic stance is an unexpected tonal angle. Transformation inevitable in hindsight: death limit becomes eternal garden. Synthesis remains individual to this sentence-chlorophyll world.</comment>
