<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arlen’s contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs. emotional surrender—are embodied in his ritual of sniff-checking lamp oil before every bloom; the final choice to catalog tears is earned by the prior sensory onslaught and carries visible cost (the copper seal, the promise to return). Interiority is specific, never clinical; “aromatically cautious” is shown through micro-choices, not labels. The only slip is a brief drift toward abstract grief summation near the end, but it does not unmotivate the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Arlen’s stance crystallizes into a lifelong vocation, the cost foreshadowed by the vial’s dimming halo and the greenhouse’s sigh. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each scent-layer tightens the emotional density until the final reconfiguration. No orientation debt; anchors (vaulted greenhouse, twilight) appear within 120 words. One minor scaffold: “the transformation completes” is asserted rather than dramatized, but it does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but active crucible: extinct flora release petrichor that mingles with the perfume, forcing Arlen’s grief into open air. Amber panes, fossilized ferns, and ultraviolet vines constrain movement and focus perception. The vial itself becomes micro-setting, glowing like a moon and then dimming—a spatial pivot that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why smells trigger tears—is signaled early and tightened by each unveiled scent-layer; the final stance crystallizes that inquiry into lifelong labor. Escalation is textural: every ghost-note raises the emotional cost until the only option left is to bear witness. Agency is present in the uncorking, the whispered vow, the copper seal. No coincidence resolves; the greenhouse’s sigh is consequence, not deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of extinct flora and living grief: memory is not archive but combustion. Subtext resides in the ultraviolet shadows—light that reveals also consumes. The final image of lantern-light awaiting future perfumes offers a resonant, non-moral answer: sorrow is renewable fuel. No thematic echo in the closing lines; the insight remains implicit in the halo of crystal shadows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that swells under pressure: “phosphorescent vines begin to pulse” mirrors the rising heartbeat of memory. Perceptual signature is aromatic—every visual is filtered through scent. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Arlen. Compression is purposeful (“mute witnesses,” “crystal shadows”) and taught early; payoff arrives in the trembling halo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, light, and memory without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—vial as moon, perfume as echo—and never mixed. One minor loop: “lantern broker, who had spent decades trading light for shadow” restates prior information, but the beat advances knowledge. No artifacts in the closure beat; final cadence slows appropriately to crystallize cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The extinct-plant greenhouse as memory theater feels fresh; the ultraviolet reveal of scent-memories is a non-obvious synthesis of science and elegy. Risk is taken in the lyric accumulative structure, yet closure remains legible. Specificity anchors universals—petrichor on petrified leaves—so the premise could not survive relocation. No derivative templates; the lantern broker’s occupation is integral, not ornamental.</comment>
