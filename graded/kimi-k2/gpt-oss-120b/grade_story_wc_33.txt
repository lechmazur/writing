<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Milo’s interiority is vivid—“respectfully rebellious gait,” “quiet contest”—but the contradictory impulses (obedience vs. rebellion) are stated more than dramatized; the final choice to release the storm and slip the truce envelope is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the storm blinds the drone, the envelope is delivered, and the rival drone salutes—an Earned Stasis that forecloses further hostility. Causal chain is tight; the bottle’s static buildup and release directly enable the decisive act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade’s neon, clinking token, and cracked tiles are tactile and atmospheric; the arcade itself constrains movement and visibility, guiding Milo’s stealth and the drones’ sensors. Micro-setting (bottle on console) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver truce without interception—is signaled early and tightened when the drone approaches; the storm’s flash is the single decisive escalation that narrows options and forces retreat. Cost is the spent storm and the quiet rain that “washes away old grudges.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending broken promises via “linking absences” emerges through action (envelope message) and image (rain in cracks) rather than statement; final nod between pilots offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“cobalt arcade at twilight hummed with low neon”—with controlled compression; no head-hopping. Syntax and diction stay within Milo’s perceptual signature even under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly lean and rhythmic; occasional elevated phrasing (“roiling clouds sealed by glass and a whispered promise”) flirts with overwriting but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—mailman using bottled weather to broker drone truce—feels fresh and specific; the arcade-as-border micro-world is memorable. Synthesis of storm-as-diplomacy and neon-as-frontier is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
