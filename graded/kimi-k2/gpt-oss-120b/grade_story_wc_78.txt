<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“eyes traced the horizon as if reading a hidden script”), but the prophet’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no moment of genuine struggle or flaw complicates his dub. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final renunciation lacks a felt personal cost—only the orchard hums in gratitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard breathes as one instrument, a charged poise that reweights the premise. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift rather than causal chain—and the lens holds. Cost is conceptual (the prophet’s solitary onward drift) but legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful; the floating orchard constrains every beat and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the prophet’s priorities—sound over sight—yet the driftwood circle never becomes a static postcard; it actively shapes the dub’s resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn obstacles into instruments—is signaled early and tightened through escalating dub iterations. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final cloud cascade demands a deeper dub, forcing a syncopated strike that costs the prophet his momentary communion. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transformation of hindrance into harmony. Subtext resides in the prophet’s solitude and the orchard’s transient song; no moral is stated. Final image of drifting onward crystallizes the thematic cost without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is selective and biased toward sonic texture. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and patterned elision (“sketched resonance”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. Occasional stacked modifiers (“restless, harmonious engine”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise of a floating orchard turned resonant instrument is fresh and fully committed; no retreat into metaphorical safety. Specificity of the xylophone mallet and fractal dub technique transforms familiar eco-lyric tropes into a singular vision. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
