<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—grief felt in “luminous torment”—yet emotion drifts into abstract waves rather than character-particular contradiction. “Motivation is simple yet terrible” is declared, not dramatized. His final beat of ascending/ descending is visually crisp and embodied, but no micro-choice other than lifting gaze shows the cost. Relationships are absent, so status crucible not invoked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens chosen: pressure rises via density and recurring “record-polish-fold” cycle. Closure as Charged Poise—basilica ascends/descends—reconfigures meaning with felt cost (“heart sinks into aching past”). Anchor clear by word 90. Causality intact: one tightening culminates in the final lift. No lens ambiguity detected.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting operates as micro-character: the dew-slick stone steams underfoot, guiding the gem-polish ritual; basilica glass becomes final constraint that lifts against gravity. Anchors embedded early (time, place), remain tracked. Weather and spatial distances hold logic: no object teleportation. Light, aroma, and mist interact with tension. “Translucent gold” basilica serves the charged ending. Gate met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fold grief into cranes—signaled at 25%. Pressure intensifies toward the moment detached shadow detaches; no false reversals. Final trade-off visible—hope ascending / past descending—creates felt cost on page. Escalation is emotional patterning, one tightening cycle adequate to lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of transformation emerges from concrete cycle of record-polish-fold. Resists tidy moral; final image reweights paradox without sermon. Light/dark, rise/fall interplay feels organic to specifics. No thematic echo lines in final paragraph. Ambiguity coherent, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Lyric, sensory-rich voice sustains single POV without leakage. Synesthetic diction (“light ripple like water”) matches lantern-maker’s craft. Compression works—no dialogue present, so voice consistency judged internally. Rhythmic control tight, no monotone loops. Micro distance shifts purposeful during basilica’s ascent. Voice feels singular and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Paragraph rhythms vary, sentences carry double duty (e.g., “Basilica quivers… aligning like constellations”). Figurative language patterned, minor over-densities (“luminous torment” reused twice) do not cloud closure. No scaffold loops detected; props track cleanly. Punctuation consistent, syntax clear under pressure. No homophone errors.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh splice—tea garden + glass basilica dream-recorder—is specific and grounded. Paradox of descending ascent reframes floating-isle trope with felt cost. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Small points gained for risking paradox rather than hedging. Risk heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
