<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“echoes of forgotten tides and buried feelings”), but the map-maker’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final release of the droplet, which feels more ritual than decision. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the cost of “becoming the voice of the unknown” is asserted rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the elm leaf fossil becomes oracle, the caves “sing,” and the map-maker hears herself reflected in stone—an earned stasis with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of heat-mapped droplets and amber pulses intensifies until the final cadence shift reweights meaning. Orientation is swift and functional; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coastal cave network is rendered through sensory specificity—“labyrinthine,” “mineral filaments,” “gusts that made the lantern-like droplets float higher”—and the elm leaf fossil itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Environment actively guides action and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving voice to the silent world—escalates via the heat-mapping ritual; each droplet tightens the pattern until the leaf’s glow reconfigures the cave’s silence into song. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible in the final pulse. Agency is present but lightly dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of translation between life and stone emerges organically from the fossil’s glow and the map-maker’s vocation; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the leaf drifting “like a solitary star” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how silence speaks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the rising cadence of the ritual. Perceptual signature is distinct—“the stones themselves were inhaling her purpose”—and free indirect style remains coherent throughout. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory data without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“factually mystical,” “oracle”) risks register drift, yet the pattern is taught early and sustained. No loops or scaffold artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses speculative botany, sensory cartography, and post-human quiet into a fresh synthesis. The fossil-as-translator feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of lyrical excess is balanced by disciplined closure. Transformation test passed: story would collapse without these exact particulars.</comment>
