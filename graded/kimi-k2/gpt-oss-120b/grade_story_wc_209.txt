<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted; the final “quiet smile” is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral. The postcards function as memory triggers, yet their weight on her immediate choices is muted until the cathedral beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cathedral prism reweights the premise that night-bloom is a shared promise, and the felt cost is Mara’s relinquishing of her childhood doubt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each postcard layer adds density until the final image crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral glass, and melting snow are selective, sensory, and thematically charged; the etched-garden vision constrains Mara’s final stance. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment subtly guides her path from pavilion to nave to garden.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled early and tightens once through the prism vision; the cost is the surrender of her lingering winter. Agency is present but the tightening beat is more perceptual than decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action; the final garden glow offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the alignment of postcard and glass, avoiding overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—“umbral tenderness,” “silver threads”—that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Mara’s selective noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked modifiers (“phosphorescent rhythm that matched her heartbeat”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of postcards, cathedral glass, and night-bloom feels fresh and inevitable; the premise is familiar but transformed through Mara’s specific memory and the prism mechanism. Risk is moderate—lyric compression rather than structural gamble.</comment>
