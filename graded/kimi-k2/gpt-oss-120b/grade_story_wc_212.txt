<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“storm of calm that churned inside her chest”), and her micro-choice to surrender the acorn cap carries visible cost. The contradiction between furious and tranquil is dramatized in the moment she kneels and asks the mist to teach her, not merely labeled. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested; single-POV arc is coherent and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira accepts the covenant and its cost, the atrium’s aurora sealing the change. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: she now carries the vortex inheritance and must guard borrowed time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound atrium is not backdrop; its melting walls and mist constrain Mira’s movements and supply the medium for the vortex. Micro-setting (copper basin, acorn cap) functions as charged object. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, selective, and evolves with action. Final aurora image recharges earlier starlight motif.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopen the covenant—signaled in paragraph two. One decisive intensification: the spiral bursts outward, scattering shards of time that settle on the phoenix’s wings, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the “cool imprint” left on Mira’s cheek and her whispered surrender to borrowed time. Agency remains hers throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical time and stewardship emerges from concrete particulars (acorn cap, frost-fire merger) rather than assertion. Final image of planting the seed reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the translucent hand brushing her cheek—rather than declaration. Complexity lingers: borrowed time must be returned, not owned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained: “shimmering mist that sang the lullabies of spring seedlings.” POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“the seed saver’s lineage could merge with the phoenix’s fire”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the spiral burst.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph cuts are clean. No artifacts in final third. Occasional elevated diction (“vortex inheritance,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: frost-phoenix meets seed-saving time-keeper in an ice cathedral. Tropes are transformed through sensory specificity and embodied cost. The oak acorn cap as temporal anchor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
