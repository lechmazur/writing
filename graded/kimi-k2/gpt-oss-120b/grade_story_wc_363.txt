<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “latent sacrifice” is announced more than embodied until the final beat, where the cost is felt but not dramatized in action. Her choices—placing puzzle pieces, threading the bead—are clear micro-choices, yet the contradiction between longing and renunciation stays summary-level. The earned stasis lands, but the emotional specificity could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each puzzle-piece click layers sound back into the raveling silence, tightening the pattern toward the silver filament’s ascent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s sacrifice becomes the warp binding worlds—visible in the dimmed bead and the orchard’s new hum. Causality is lyric rather than strictly causal, but the pattern holds and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo, and dew-slick soil are vividly filtered through Mara’s tactile attention; the amber bead itself functions as micro-setting that constrains her path. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory selection narrows under urgency. The final image of faint orchard glow recharges the setting with memory, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send the message across impossible distance—is signaled early and escalates through each puzzle piece’s click restoring sound. The tightening occurs when Mara places the bead on the pedestal, foreclosing her own luminosity. Cost is visible in the dimmed bead and her whispered gratitude, though the escalation is more pattern-deepening than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sacrifice as the loom of tomorrow emerges organically from Mara’s actions and the orchard’s charged silence; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the faintly glowing orchard reweights the earlier raveling hush into a new pattern of hope and loss. Theme is carried by concrete particulars—the bead, the filament, the dimming—without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific: “bamboo leaves brushed her cheeks with a whisper that reminded her of past sacrifices.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. The patterned elision of time and sound is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, occasionally risking purple (“stoically sparkling like a captured sunrise”) but the rhythm supports the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; information is layered efficiently. One mixed metaphor—“loom of absence”—slightly muddles, yet clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The loom-spinner in a silence-eating bamboo orchard feels fresh; the puzzle-map and amber-bead compass transform familiar quest tropes into lyrical ritual. Specificity of dew, plum blossoms, and filament keeps the world from sliding into generic fantasy. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
