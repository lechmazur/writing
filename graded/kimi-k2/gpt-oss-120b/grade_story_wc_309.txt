<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selric’s interior contradiction—yearning for quiet brilliance while fearing inadequacy—drives every beat; the unstrapping and palm-to-keystone micro-choices crystallize his shift from self-doubt to earned humility with visible cost (the glow he once hid now warms the spire). No stock phrasing; embodied emotion in “faint chime” footfalls and heartbeat-synced pulse. Flaw (soft-glow magic) complicates choices and is not tidily resolved. Meets 9+ quick test except for slight over-articulation of “sacred in the simple” near end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each repetition of “lingering luminance” thickens pattern until the keystone’s final pulse reconfigures meaning—Selric’s glow becomes communal memory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the brilliant dimness now travels with him, cost paid by relinquishing acclaim. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks; ellipsis between ascent and summit is taught by lyric pattern. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire, frost veil, and luminous fog are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain the mist-walking mechanics. Keystone’s glow doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to heartbeat and chime under pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no impossible positions. Meets 9+ gate: the keystone’s surface literally enables the impossible platform.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the worth of quiet brilliance—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each step up the spire intensifies the cost of hiding his glow. Final tightening occurs when he places palm to stone, foreclosing the path of anonymity; cost is the exposure of his once-derided light. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred resides in unquantifiable, gentle luminance versus mechanized spectacle. Subtext in the keystone’s “memory of every simple wonder” reframes prior failures without moralizing. Final image of fireflies scattering across clouds offers non-literal, resonant answer. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers about whether cities will ever notice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “brilliant dimness,” “mist-soft steps,” rhythmic repetition of “lingering luminance.” POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“hovered at the base”) and paid off in final descent. Syntax mirrors Selric’s tentative wonder—long, breath-held sentences that fracture into shorter pulses at climax. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: “robes frayed like old drafts” does double duty. Rhythm varies; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“accommodates impossibilities”) fits mage POV. Final third clean; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underachieving mage whose “flaw” is softness of glow, paired with a stone that anchors forgotten simple wonders. Mist-walking as humble ascension method subverts epic quest tropes. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specificity of “automation below” and “icebound spire” integral. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off.</comment>
