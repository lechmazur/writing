<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—reverence for silence vs. need to break it—are embodied in trembling finger, swollen violin, and final bow stroke. Motive intensifies from curiosity to sacred duty, culminating in earned renunciation when she returns the dried program. Cost is felt in the hush that settles “like gentle water.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: water-etched staff lines and lantern flickers tighten the pattern until the sustained note reconfigures the hall’s silence into heard aria. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—steady lanterns signal the ghost’s release and Mara’s new guardianship. Cost: the ghost’s departure and Mara’s promise to return into perpetual listening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Flooded opera house is no backdrop; water depth, lantern tremble, and warped program constrain every move. Micro-setting—the cracked floorboards bearing water-glyphs—literally scripts the final note. Environment charges the ending when lanterns steady into “promise.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: free the trapped aria. Pressure escalates as water glyphs accumulate, narrowing Mara’s choices to one sustained note. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates. Cost is the ghost’s departure and Mara’s acceptance of custodianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “music in the silences” emerges through glyphs, gaps in the program, and the final realization that the code is absence itself. No moralizing; the ending image of dry program in empty seat reweights the entire preceding pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, atmospheric voice stays tightly focalized in Mara’s sensorium: “amber light trembling like breath on wet wood.” Syntax swells and ebbs with humidity and tension. No head-hop; every perception is filtered through her trained ear and haunted curiosity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern—water glyphs, lantern pulses—without purple drift. Occasional slight overwriting (“gentle water” twice) but never at closure. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing, accelerating toward the held note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost story meets musical cryptography via water damage. Prima-donna legend is transformed into a score of silences. Risky lyric accumulation pays off when the empty staff lines become the aria. Specificity of swollen violin and vellum program anchors the fantastical.</comment>
