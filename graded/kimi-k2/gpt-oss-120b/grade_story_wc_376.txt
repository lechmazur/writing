<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motive—reignite candor to heal a shattered society—is stated rather than embodied. Internal contradiction surfaces only once: she refuses the council yet the action carries no body-felt cost (grey metal aside). Micro-choices catalog texts rather than press against personal stakes. Character voice remains gorgeously textured, but the culminating decision lacks visible sacrifice; the closure reads more symbolic than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chosen lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: candor re-charges the air and the city "brighten[s]"—final image reweights earlier stakes with conceptual + environmental cost. Each fragment’s pulse and every bottled word build textured density to this single cadence shift. No causality break; progression moves by pattern, not causal turns, which the closure honors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass towers "breathing misty sighs" and bioluminescent ferns anchor the micro-claustrophobic greenhouse in sensory specificity. The zinc plate and the map fragment operate as setting-objects that shape choices (where to step, what to say). Toxic sky constrains breath, bottle-walls constrain movement; space feels tactile and reactive. Final vent emerges cleanly from prior world cues without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the city by restoring truth. Escalation is textural intensification—each aligned map fragment tightens atmospheric pressure; the vent’s roar literalizes the tightening. Cost is legible but soft: a simple whisper “surged” the poison away, without later stamina or social price. Closure narrows to one decisive spoken truth, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme threads candor as living nutrient for wilted words and civic air. Bottled unheard conversations embody the moral—truth withheld rots. Final image reconfigures premise without sermonizing: "the day the sky healed." Subtext resides in the vibrating bottles instead of explicit statements. The risk of sentimentality is skirted via tangible object resonance rather than abstract bromides.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice stays lush, syntactically varied, sensorily precise (“taste of rust,” “ink shimmered like sunrise on metal”). Compression and lyric elision are consistent; the narrative voice rarely slips from the calligrapher’s perceptual filter. One or two elegant metaphors border self-indulgence, but none muddle causality or stall momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Language is vivid yet occasionally purple—adjacent high-density metaphors in crisis beats create minor blur. Rhythm is varied; no boilerplate loops. One paraphrase loop (“lost conversations”) appears twice without added pressure, deducted once (-0.3). Otherwise concise information density: lines advance scene, character, or atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of candor-as-nutrient, bottled memories, and living zinc is fresh, not derivative. Greenhouse as archive of bottled unspoken speech is a novel micro-setting. Risk carries through: the climax is a whisper, not a showdown, but stakes remain legible. While the “healing sky” beat risks familiar eco-arc, grounding it in calligraphy and bottled words yields specific inflection.</comment>
