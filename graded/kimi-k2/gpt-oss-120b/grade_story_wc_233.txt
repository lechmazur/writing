<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The queen’s interiority is vivid—her crown’s weight, the “pull of darker curiosity”—but her contradictory impulses (duty vs. dream) are stated more than dramatized until the orb kiss. The final renunciation earns its cost, yet earlier beats lean on lyric summary rather than micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orb’s burst dissolves the dreams and reweights her crown from burden to key. Causal chain holds—dream map → grotto → orb → renunciation—though the retinue’s role is ornamental. Cost is legible in the empty grotto and her solitary descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is richly textured—“cobalt grotto above clouds,” “stone shimmered like liquid sapphire”—and the ember walls actively pulse, guiding her steps. The crystal basin and obsidian cradle constrain the final choice, charging the closure image with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—end the recurring dreams—is signaled early and tightened when the map appears. One meaningful deepening: the dream is not curse but map. Cost is felt in the orb’s dissolution and her solitary vigil, though external pressure remains largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of sovereignty versus self-knowledge emerges through the crown’s shifting symbolism and the starlight transfusion. Subtext is strongest in the orb’s kiss—power accepted as stewardship, not dominion. Final image avoids moralizing, letting the hushed ridge resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with a regal cadence that modulates under pressure—“softly commanding” whispers at the climax. Sensory filter is queen-specific; no head-hop. Occasional lyric density (“lacy menace of the night”) risks overwriting but stays within pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and propulsive, but stacked metaphors—“bleeding starlight,” “cobalt grotto,” “lacy menace”—create slight purple drift. No loops or scaffold; rhythm serves ascent and descent. One mixed image: “walls exhaled a thin mist that caught the moonlight, turning it into bleeding starlight” momentarily muddles physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is re-visioned through starlight as memory and crown as key, yielding fresh mythic resonance. Specificity of ember grotto and orb mechanics prevents template feel. Risk lies in high lyricism, but coherence holds.</comment>
