<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. spectral empathy—surface in embodied micro-choices (setting the barrel, whispering to ghosts). The ledger retrieval crystallizes her arc with visible cost: she trades her “weightless burden” for purposeful guardianship. Interiority stays concrete; no therapy-speak. One slip: “skillfully observant” is asserted more than dramatized in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust, calliope, ticking) tightens the pattern until the attic diagram reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ledger lifted, ghosts acknowledged—cost legible in Mara’s feather-light shoulder. Orientation anchored by ~90 words. No causality breaks; one minor ellipsis (how she knows the barrel will map beams) is paid off by spectral resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Environment, body, and tool interlock: the brass barrel becomes micro-setting that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Selective sensory triangulation—rain, sawdust, mirror-glint—guides every move. Spatial choreography is clean; ladder creaks track with ascent. Weather and decay subtly mirror internal thaw. One hairline slip: “bruised clouds” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what ceilings hide—tightens via dust-pattern analysis and spectral tug. One decisive deepening: the attic diagram reveals the alcove, foreclosing ignorance. Cost is felt in the ledger’s brittle pages and the ghosts’ chorus. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening to forgotten voices emerges from concrete particulars—ledger names, dust paths—never stated. Final image of stars blinking in barrel-rhythm offers non-literal answer: acknowledgment as quiet redemption. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “promises the circus made.” One soft echo: “cracks as frames” is close to explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s technician gaze parses dust as traffic routes, brass as diagnostic tool. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during hatch opening, longer lyric stretches during revelation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under spectral proximity. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops. Figurative language is selective—“shattered marquee flapped like a tired animal” earns its keep. Syntax accelerates during ladder climb, breathes during ledger reveal. No mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “weightless burden” repeated twice could trim once.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech + horologist’s tool + spectral cartography feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Dust-pattern diagnostics as ghost-tracking is inventive and grounded. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost. No derivative echoes; circus setting is retooled from nostalgic trope to archive of lost labor.</comment>
