<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selene’s curiosity and grief are embodied through tactile micro-choices—placing the shell, lifting the ledger—yet the interior contradiction between myth-busting and wonder is stated more than dramatized in scene. The final smile and pocketing of the shell register as earned endurance, but the cost feels generalized rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each resonant hum layers density until the final chord reweights the stake—myths survive through retelling. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with conceptual cost (curiosity must stay mobile), but the ledger’s “final verses” arrive late and slightly dilute causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Observatory, cello, and shell form a micro-setting that constrains movement and channels sound; the cracked dome and dust-laden ribbons mirror Selene’s internal brittleness. Specificity is selective and purposeful, though spatial choreography around the telescope could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why myths endure—is signaled early and tightened when the compass needle “trembles like a laugh,” forcing Selene to accept retelling as answer. The pressure deepens through pattern accumulation rather than causal reversal; cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: myths persist when curiosity re-embodies them in art. The final image of the shell pulsing like a heart reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the cello’s sighs avoids sentimentality, though the late ledger chant edges toward overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Selene’s myth-buster lens. Patterned elision (“inside the whisper of closing pages”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, with rhythmic variation that matches the cello’s cadence. Occasional stacked metaphors (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “ephemeral compass spun wildly, its needle trembling like a laugh”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Familiar quest for meaning is refreshed by the acoustic alchemy of shell, cello, and observatory. The synthesis feels specific and inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in the lyric compression, but coherence never wavers. No close echoes or gimmicks.</comment>
