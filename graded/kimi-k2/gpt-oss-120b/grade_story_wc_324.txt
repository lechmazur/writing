<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Protagonist’s relentless curiosity is embodied through immediate micro-choices—tuning, tracing, promising—rather than abstract labels; the final choice to carry the voice beyond death earns emotional cost in a quiet Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Electromagnetic pulse beats trace a clear causal loop from shattered hearing-aid tremor to the alcove’s synchronised choir; the closure resets color into the photograph, a resonant reconfiguration that links living and dead with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Mist and marble statues aren’t backdrop; they direct movement, obscure sightlines, and lend acoustic metaphors (dying heart in stone). The atrium’s fog and twilight violet charge the final chorus of light that re-colors the photograph, making the environment indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—rescuing a voice before oblivion—tightens through three discrete beat-level choices (scanner sync, track, whisper back). Pressure crystallizes when the protagonist renounces anonymity to bear the singer’s song, closing the path with visible moral cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The theme crystallizes not as moral but as a resonant pattern: curiosity as ethical responsibility to the unheard. The final image of the photo blooming in color offers a quiet, non-literal answer that reweights every earlier whisper and statue tear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“cartographer of sighs,” “choir’s fading hymn”—is controlled under pressure; free-indirect shifts stay clean, no head-hops. Hearing-aid whispers are voiced with intentional indirection that sharpens subtext without explanatory leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High-density, propulsive lines propel each discovery without scaffold loops; no filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. Mixed metaphors are few and intentional (“circuitry humming like a dying heart”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The “contact-tracer for hearts” premise combines memory rescue via EM pulse—an original synthesis that feels inevitable once introduced. Incidental heroism is enacted rather than stated, transforming stray curiosity into quiet moral obligation.</comment>
