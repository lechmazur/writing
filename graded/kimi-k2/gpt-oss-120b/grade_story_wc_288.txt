<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrically voiced yet remains anchored in tactile micro-choices (placing the sundial, feeling vibrations). The “contemporary of the sky-whale” claim is never tested or dramatized, so it functions as atmospheric label rather than motive force. Still, her arc from solitary reader to co-creator of a communal chorus is embodied in the final step onto the mist stair, carrying visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s shift from mute archive to breathing chorus is legible on the page, and Mira’s new stance (“ready to write the next chapter”) forecloses her earlier isolation. Causality is lyric rather than strictly causal, but the pattern is taught early and held to the final image. One transition (library interior → summit) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tidal library is more than postcard; floating shelves and cloud-tides actively constrain movement and supply the stone circle’s hum as resource. The brass sundial doubles as micro-setting and tool, its reflective face charging the final sunrise image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened once: the sundial’s placement awakens scripts, forcing Mira to accept partnership with the whale’s memory. Cost is felt in the “brittle awakenings” that risk shattering coherence. Agency is lyrical but present; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence emerges through image and action rather than statement. The whale’s memory as “bridge, not chain” is earned by the final shared hum. Subtext resides in the sundial’s glow—once a solitary timepiece, now communal beacon—avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“marble arches of the library,” “atomically reflective surface”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no register drift; internal cadence modulates with emotional rise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Occasional soft echoes (“hum,” “pulse”) risk loop but remain within tolerance. No clarity breaks at closure. Strong sentence variety and sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-whale memory, floating library, and sundial as memory-interface feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure is justified by coherent closure. Specificity of “atomically reflective” and “brittle awakenings” lifts familiar motifs into new light.</comment>
