<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—tactile cataloguing of quarry grains and echos—but the “dormant empathy” awakening reads like an externally imposed epiphany rather than an embodied re-weighting of choice. No micro-choice visibly alters her tactics after the tear falls, so the cost of the new-found empathy isn’t on the page. Traits align with action except the moment her compassion seals itself without causal consequence.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the mist lifts and the stone “exhales” the names. Cost is perceptible in the tear and the cracked slab, but the causal line (“therefore the quarry speaks”) still feels lightly enchanted rather than rigorously driven. Orientation is clear; drive stays Accumulative/Textural. Meets closure unit and scale guardrails cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The quarry’s mist-wrapped stone walls, the mask ribbon, the faint carvings, and the split limestone each function as tactile constraints that force Mara to paint with fingers, not sight. The sensory filter is character-specific and every descriptive shard funnels back into choices (mask fragment as tactile prompt, fissure as new surface to trace). Atmospheric detail never drifts into postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—bringing forgotten victims back into communal memory—is signalled early and gains density through each recovered name. Quarry itself supplies the final twist (crack reveals carvings) which counts as Accumulative/Textural deepening. No visible price paid by Mara herself, limiting escalation score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Emergent theme—memory is reclaimed through tactile witness rather than vision—never speaks its name. The ribbon reprise and void-eyed portrait crystallise the idea without assertion. Late tear-glint reads as Charged Poise that reconfigures the reader’s sense of empathy and absence. Avoids overt moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Distinctly tactile, slightly synesthetic diction carries throughout: “thin line of blood on stone floor,” “furrowed hush.” No head-hopping; POV distance consistent with tactile blindness. Syntax breathes with Mara’s pace. Prose texture is individual and sustained without lapsing into overwritten lyricism.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lean and un-looped. Concrete nouns, active verbs, purposeful metaphors, no paraphrase stacks. One mild loop—“stone walls swallowing sound and light” echoed two sentences apart—costs a hair. Otherwise, clarity and momentum unmarred.</comment>

<comment>Cold-case artist in a sentient quarry blends fresh angles, but the “stone exhales the forgotten” leans supernatural without being set up by world logic. Enough specificity in tactile painting method and ribbon talisman to keep clichés at bay. Transformation test holds.</comment>
