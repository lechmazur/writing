<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s “balancedly curious” trait is stated repeatedly but only once—when she notes the anchor link’s mass shift—does it visibly constrain a choice. Interiority is evocative yet drifts toward summary (“she felt the pull…”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final whispered promise is earned by prior beats but lacks a felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s collective exhale and Mira’s whispered vow crystallize the new stance toward starlight navigation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt; a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The benthic city is vivid—pressure-hardened basalt, bioluminescent algae, sonar arrays—yet only the anchor link actively constrains the vessel’s balance. Spatial choreography is coherent; the observation deck and statue ground the POV. Environment subtly mirrors interior states without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigate by starlight—is signaled early and tightens through the successful test launch. One meaningful deepening occurs when the anchor link’s mass shift teaches equilibrium. Cost is conceptual (loss of pure abyssal isolation) but not viscerally dramatized for Mira herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme of bridging depth and sky emerges organically from the anchor link’s evolving meaning and the alien lattice’s rewriting of geometry. Final image of the rusted link catching alien glow offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids explicit moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control under pressure (“mournful precision yet marvelously hopeful”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira’s selective attention to photon nodes and star-filtration. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked modifiers (“somber marvel of discovery”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence shift is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Fusion of abyssal gothic and alien mathematics feels fresh; edge geometry as navigation method is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Anchor link reimagined as cosmic fulcrum transforms familiar object into thematic engine. Risk-taking remains coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
