<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“dust of forgotten reels swirled like slow snow”), but the gazer’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure alters tactics. The final “whispered goodbye” is a gesture, not a renunciation with visible cost. Motivation is consistent yet static—she seeks stored love but never confronts a live trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory and emotional layers tightens until the liquid-light river reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—unused love floods her heart, leaving her “humming with the echo”—but the cost is more luminous than felt. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The projection booth is evoked with velvet, dust, thunderous hush—details filter through POV urgency. The rusted tin box and melting celluloid function as micro-settings that constrain the final act. Yet the environment never physically impedes; it mirrors rather than shapes choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locating and freeing unused love—is signaled early. Pressure deepens via psychometric visions and the glowing map, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. The final release feels inevitable rather than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of unmailed love emerges organically from the letters’ chorus; no explicit moralizing. The ending’s liquid-light reconfigures the premise—unused love becomes portable lantern—offering resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in humming and thunder subtly links private grief to cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, tactile, and consistent: “cartographer mapping invisible continents,” “storm held in her throat.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final chord.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language rarely stalls momentum. Occasional stacked metaphors (“river of memory,” “constellations waiting for a story”) flirt with excess but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychometric incubation of unmailed love inside a film labyrinth—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes of crystal gazer and haunted cinema are transformed through sensory specificity and conceptual reweighting. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
