<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling fingers,” “luminescent ache”), and his contradictory impulse—fear of fragmentation vs. need to descend—drives the spiral descent. The final renunciation of the old self is earned by the prior tarot spiral and darkness ordeal. Minor slip: “crestfallen” is stated more than dramatized early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the redesigned portrait crystallizes the cost of descent and ascent. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each card layer reweights the stake until the mosaic portrait reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is tactile—“salt and old paper,” “phosphorescent algae”—and the spiral of cards literally maps the space, constraining Elian’s path. Micro-setting (broken tarot box) becomes the final glowing object that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can brokenness become canvas?—tightens as each card narrows options toward the necessary darkness. One decisive intensification: the slamming door seals daylight, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the “steady pulse” replacing ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation-as-canvas emerges organically from tarot spiral and descent; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the redesigned portrait offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with perceptual signature—“luminescent ache,” “salt-breath”—consistent under pressure. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the spiral descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“thin, luminescent ache”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot-as-portrait-process inside a breathing lighthouse. Fragmented-reality trope is transformed through tactile specificity and earned closure. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
