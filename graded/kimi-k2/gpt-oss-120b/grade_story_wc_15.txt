<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the weaver’s “hauntingly optimistic” trait is asserted rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final beat feels pre-ordained. Still, her single-minded purpose and ritualized action create a coherent arc with visible cost—she defies guild law and exhausts herself nightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s transformation from ruin to reverence is legible, and the old guildmasters’ kneeling signals irreversible change. Causality is lyrical (Accumulative/Textural lens) rather than tight because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and holds. The luminous map on the plate provides the final charged image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Red canyon, stone corridors, and empty tide pools are vividly sketched and filtered through the weaver’s tide-informed perception. The loom’s hum and orchid scent anchor sensory specificity. The labyrinth itself constrains her path and later guides travelers, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor spatial drift: we never see how corridors physically change after her stitching.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring beauty to a ruined labyrinth—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through nightly exhaustion and the risk of guild censure, culminating in humbled masters. Agency is present but diffuse; the “overlapping sleepwalking” method softens causal clarity. Cost is visible in cracked tide pools and her bone-deep fatigue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through transgression emerges organically from the weaver’s defiance of “broken precedents.” The orchid motif and luminous threads accumulate meaning without overt statement. Final image of sunrise reflected on the plate offers a non-literal answer: reverence is possible only after ruin is acknowledged. Avoids moralizing, though lyricism edges toward soft abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and tide-soaked; diction (“orchid solace,” “luminous yarn”) remains within the weaver’s poetic register. Syntax flows like breathing, modulating with dream logic. No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression and elision are purposeful and taught early, paid off in the final luminous canopy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly precise; occasional stacked metaphors (“orchid veins in frost”) flirt with purple but stay legible. Rhythm supports the tidal cadence. A few near-paraphrase loops (“sew the world’s wounds,” “gentle, orchid-soft hands”) dull the final beat slightly. No mechanical artifacts or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Combines mythic weaver, dream cartography, and stone labyrinth in a fresh synthesis. The “overlapping sleepwalking paths” device feels novel and thematically apt. Risky lyric mode succeeds without gimmickry. Familiar “healing the broken world” arc is lifted by sensory specificity and the guild-law transgression.</comment>
