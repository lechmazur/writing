<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (mentor resilience) is legible, and interior contradictions appear in her combative tenderness, yet several beats compress into summary rather than embodied choice, muting escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands: the final image of shards re-forming is a charged Earned Stasis that reweights exile as reversible pilgrimage. Lens holds (accumulative/textural).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The forgotten library’s dust and cracked window constrain movement and perception, but object-level specificity peaks late with the altar and shard愈合; solid micro-setting effect edges toward essential, not ubiquitous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring the library) tightens via one development moment (tea-leaf geometry reconfiguring closure timing). Missing visible resource cost at 600-word cap keeps it shy of high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>“Reversible exile emerges organically from the library’s fate and the lullaby-cipher; the final shadow fracture re-prices the central concept with resonant tenderness.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich, tactile prose (“metallic hymn,” “gold ribbons”), POV consistent in filter and rhythm; occasional lyric density slows imminent beats but voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Compression achieves high information density, yet some figurative loops (“ancient whispers on shelves…” amid the climax) dilute propulsion; micro redundancies nudge downward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry repurposing lullaby fragments for time-coded liberation is an inventive synthesis; some phrases skirt purple, capping shy of higher ingenuity.</comment>
