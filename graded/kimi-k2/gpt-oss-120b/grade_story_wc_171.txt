<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her tear, the ache in her shoulders—but the “operatively gentle” paradox is asserted more than dramatized; we see its effect on others, not the internal friction it costs her. The final bow of the chieftains is moving, yet her own decisive micro-choice (lifting the clipboard) feels foregone rather than wrestled. Still, her embodied emotion and the visible price anchor the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the swords on the altar, the clipboard between them, and the dawn hymn crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (fire, jasmine, celestial motion) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. One transition (night → dawn) is seamless and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The terrace, firelight, and slow wheeling stars are selective and atmospheric, but only the altar and clipboard actively constrain choice. The jasmine wind at the end recharges earlier motifs, nudging the score up. A hairline slip from postcard to crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will the clans lay down swords?”—is signaled early and tightened once when the first chieftain steps forward. The cost is visible in the blades surrendered and Lira’s tear. No false reversals; pressure accretes under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption’s price emerges through concrete ritual acts rather than statement. The final image of swords-as-pact and clipboard-as-canvas offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. One near-miss: “price of redemption” is named aloud, but the surrounding action earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic modulation under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira notices fire flickers on the clipboard, not generic “beauty.” No head-hopping; celestial choreography is filtered through her awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but mostly purposeful; occasional stacked modifiers (“flawed beauty,” “fragile magnificence”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the Accumulative texture. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“the sky spun lazily”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of celestial mechanics with treaty-making feels fresh, and the clipboard-as-contractual-altar is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes of peace rituals are transformed through sensory density rather than novelty of plot.</comment>
