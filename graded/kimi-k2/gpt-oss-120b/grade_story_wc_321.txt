<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lio’s resilient grin remains surface-level, but the contradiction between his public optimism and private drive to bend time is not embodied in-scene; the final reversal is narrated rather than dramatized through visible choice and body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise (“permanent transient heartbeat”)—a lyrical reconfiguration with felt cost—but the because/therefore linkage is weak; the ferry’s reappearance feels like mystical fiat rather than direct consequence of cause/effect built from Lio’s radio tone alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grotto, silver-coin moon and phosphorescent sound threads are vivid, yet they function largely as atmospheric wallpaper rather than tactical constraints; only the hourglass finally guides the helm, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—merging timelines—is signaled early, but escalation lacks tightening; pressure arises from lyrical images more than lived trade-offs, and agency is narrated rather than dramatized through specific decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of sand rising against gravity and the “permanent transient” paradox, avoiding explicit statement, yet remains generalized rather than anchored in one character’s irreversible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Prose carries a lyrical, elevated register that remains singular and consistent; phrases like “lattice of sound that glimmered like phosphorescent threads” teach the piece’s slightly mystic compression early and sustain it through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Occasional overwriting and synonym clusters (“spectral grotto under starlight” / “silver coin into the grotto’s pool”) accumulate without propulsion; “permanent transience” verges on contradictory metaphor. Density remains high and the ending glows, but clutter prevents flawless 8.8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>The synthesis of mundane ferry service with magical time-bending vanishings and an hourglass whose sand rises offers fresh, non-obvious fusion; risk is coherent within its gentle lyric frame, leaving a lasting image.</comment>
