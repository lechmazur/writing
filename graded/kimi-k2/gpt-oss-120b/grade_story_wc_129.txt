<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arlen’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “boldly sympathetic” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a choice that costs her. The final vow to dedicate the arbor is voiced, not dramatized, so the felt cost is muted. Secondary villagers remain off-page, so no relationship crucible is tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glyph’s redefinition from hidden mark to living symbol reweights the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of shared reeds and light—held to the end. One transition (nightfall) is clean; orientation is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are rendered with luminous specificity; the arbor’s refracted light constrains the final tapestry placement, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community grafting—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each reed added tightens the web. The final cost is conceptual (perpetual duty to newcomers) rather than visceral, but legible under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the evolving glyph and the arbor’s transformation into sanctuary. Subtext is carried by light and reeds, avoiding overt moralizing. Final image of spiraled stems offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific—“reeds whispering underfoot,” “violet ribbons.” No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Arlen’s sensorium. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“webs of kinship,” “luminescent ache”) risk overwriting but pattern is sustained. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise fuses reed sculptor, obsidian arbor, and communal glyph hunt into a fresh synthesis. Risk lies in the lyric mode itself; it succeeds because the final spiral sculpture makes the concept inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
