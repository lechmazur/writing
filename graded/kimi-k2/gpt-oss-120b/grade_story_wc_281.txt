<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and affection are embodied in her tactile calibration of LEDs and the micro-choice to test without drugs; the interior contradiction is palpable. The final “surge of purpose” is earned by the prior embodied trial and the cost of risking self-rewiring. Yet the shift from doubt to conduit feels slightly smoothed—more hopeful assertion than wrenching concession—keeping it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pulse of light layers density until the final “faint whisper” reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s stance crystallizes from observer to conduit, cost legible in the lingering charge under her skin. The sequence is coherent, though the external stakes (consortium response) remain off-page, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The loft’s neon ribbons and cracked panes are filtered through Mara’s selective attention, constraining her movements and guiding the LED choreography. The muscovite sliver functions as micro-setting, its veins dictating pulse patterns that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the city-wide blackout feels briefly generic, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving neural resonance without drugs—tightens when each pulse risks overwriting her own markers. The deepening occurs as the geode’s feedback forces a trade-off: surrender skepticism or abandon the experiment. Cost is felt in the electric tingle that persists after the trial, though the external stakes (peer review) are off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: skepticism versus wonder refracted in light. The willowglass hope is earned via the somatic cost of self-experimentation, not stated. Final image of the glowing slab reweights earlier doubt without moralizing, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise yet lyrical, matching a light-painter’s perceptual bias. Compression (“fractally precise intervals”) teaches the pattern early; payoff lands in the final pulse. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mara’s lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“telepathy pill recall”) feels academic but is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. Minor loop risk in “pulse…pulse” cadence is offset by rhythmic variation. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. Clean mechanics; only “willowglass” neologism could read as precious to some editors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of neuroscience jargon, light art, and crystalline feedback is fresh and specific. The telepathy-pill recall is transformed into a non-pharmacological somatic ritual. Risk-taking (using a geode as neural interface) pays off without gimmickry. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
