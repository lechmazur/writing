Thank you for the story—I will now evaluate it against the rubric. Please allow me a few moments to apply each of the eight required categories and then score the nine mandated elements.

## Required Output  

<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ghost’s yearning for one last encore anchors every choice; his memory-haunted interiority deepens beat by beat under surging synesthetic pressure, steering the final sacrifice.</comment>  

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Timeline fracture arcs because/therefore across beat chain: ghost’s echoed performance → orchard lights coalesce → shopkeeper steps in → healed thread. Closure lands as decisive change with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>  

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Old theater’s velvet curtains, neon city twilight, and the garden’s glowing apples are purpose-repeated and constrain each movement; the translucent stage under foliage is unforgettable.</comment>  

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—a last chance to summon hope—follows escalation track: drifting curtains amplify desperation, orchard tightens via audio-compressed echoes, climax locks choice.</comment>  

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nostalgia and second-chance possibility arise from concrete particulars—bursting luminous apples, chords of forgotten songs—never moralized; the final reprise reframes desolation without tidy resolution.</comment>  

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poise of liquid-violet syntax, rhythmic song of brass and cinnamon—distinct perceptual signature held throughout; no head-hop, switches clean across single collective stance.</comment>  

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Every sentence advances—the synesthetic synopses are vivid yet compressed, loops absent; “glowed like lanterns, each branch humming a different chord” reads natural under lyric pulse.</comment>  

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of ghosts, tarot coins, and time-mending orchards feels inevitable; rousing nostalgia charged by the exact ghost-synth blend rather than prompt-filler checklist.</comment>
