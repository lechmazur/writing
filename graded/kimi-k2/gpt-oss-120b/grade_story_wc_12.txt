<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-character focus delivers nuanced metaphysical interiority, yet priest’s decisions arise more from abstract cosmology than grounded traits: motives float in ornate diction rather than embodied struggle, blurring cost legibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Treated as Accumulative/Textural prism: layered sonic loops, indigo pulses, and unraveling stillness build toward earned closure when anchor stabilizes. Lacks a single wrenching beat that forces visible cost; closure lands as resonant reconfiguration rather than decisive act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Floating cathedral, dimensional anchor, and indigo spill are vivid, specific, thematically charged; spatial logic drifts, distances blurred—but compression and sensory selection serve the dream logic well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stillness-shatter is signaled early; pressure thickens in each echoed loop until final spike collapses the equilibrium—tightening is legible, but off-stage crowd lessens felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Illumination-of-assumption theme emerges from sonic crucible, reframing perception without moral sermon; restraint avoids platitudes, resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hypnotic rhythm mimics loop pedal, perceptual metaphors abound; occasional phrasal excess (“decorated with silence” repeats) but coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Musical sentence patterns heighten texture, but periodic abstractions (“muted clarity,” “gentle roar”) create small loop artifacts; strong cadence holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wondrous synesthesia—synesthetic sermon via lone indigo in sonic architecture—transforms familiar elements into unique devotional cyber-ritual.</comment>
