<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arin’s “luminous skeptic” trait is embodied in his defiant tracing of footprints and refusal to worship the signal; the contradictory impulse to both question and participate is dramatized when he offers the amber to the tower. Interiority is specific, but the final shift to “home is a pattern of returning” feels slightly abstract rather than earned by prior embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s pulse synchronizes with the amber, reweighting “home” from place to reciprocal chemistry. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (rain, glow, vibration) intensifies until the final charged poise. Cost is felt in the amber’s dim ember and Arin’s renunciation of awe for inquiry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, wet stones, and fly amber’s prismatic droplets are filtered through Arin’s skeptical gaze; the setting constrains his pilgrimage path and supplies the marble slab where the decisive amber ritual occurs. Sensory hierarchy tightens under pressure—rain becomes metronome, glow becomes conduit—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Arin choose inquiry over awe—is signaled early and tightened when the alien echo matches the amber’s signature, forcing his reciprocal experiment. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory layer increases density until the tower breathes. The cost is the amber’s spent glow and the irreversible shift from passive reception to active dialogue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: homecoming as mutual chemical reaction rather than territorial return. Subtext resides in the amber’s preserved insects—stasis versus dialogue—culminating in the tower’s new rhythm. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing, though the final sentence edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature skews scientific (“chemical fingerprint,” “elemental bonds”) against the bronze quiet atmosphere. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences swell, then fragment as rain intensifies. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Arin’s skeptical sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory data or conceptual pressure. Minor loop: “bronze quiet” is repeated three times without pattern-teaching, a hairline distraction. Otherwise, syntax and metaphor remain coherent, accelerating into the final tower-breath cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of entomological amber, alien chemistry, and pilgrimage architecture feels fresh; tropes of first contact are subverted by foregrounding reciprocal experiment over revelation. Specificity of the “fly amber” and “dusty footprints” grounds the concept. A slight risk in lyric density pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
