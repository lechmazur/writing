<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet’s aesthetic drive is vivid and embodied, but his interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the final step forward feels inevitable yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the colonnade’s violet shift and amber lake reconfigure meaning with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off. Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake are sensorily rich and constrain movement; the colonnade’s humming quartz becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dissolving boundaries—tightens via the poet’s paraphrase act and the colonnade’s chromatic response. One meaningful intensification; cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of boundary dissolution emerges organically from image and action; final amber glow reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in color shifts and hush rather than statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric voice is consistent, textured, and perceptually specific; patterned elision taught early and sustained. No POV drift; cadence modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional stacked metaphors risk overwriting but never obscure causality. Rhythm supports momentum; no loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lyric mode with crystalline architecture; boundary dissolution rendered through color and sound rather than trope. Risky compression pays off in final image.</comment>
