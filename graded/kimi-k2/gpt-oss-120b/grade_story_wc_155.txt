<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motive — “to rediscover lost joy and share it” — is stated early and stays consistent; interiority is abstract rather than embodied, emotions labeled rather than enacted. A visible cost is present: fragment dissolves into starlight—an earned renunciation—but prior causality is more lyrical assertion than micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot threads daydream-time with mural-growth montage; closure is a soft Reverberation rather than decisive change (fragment melding with night sky). Accumulative lyricism obeys its own internal rhythm, yet no concrete choice is foreclosed with palpable cost; it drifts toward closure rather than tightens toward it.</comment>

<comment>Ruined orchard, perpetual fog, fresco-lit walls are atmospheric and tactile; the orchard walls actually host the glowing mural itself, turning the “ruined” micro-setting into the final luminous garden. Setting does pressure choices by providing visible surface for the act, though physics of light-painting remains lightly abstract.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stakes—lost joy vs. sorrow—stay poetic but not pressure-testable; escalation arrives as a steady glow-up montage rather than a narrowing of options. Agency is present but diffuse, cost legible only symbolically; no single beat tightens or forces a trade-off under situational lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme of art as transmuted sorrow emerges through repeated glow rather than declaration; final starlight-fusion image reweights prior gloom. Despite gentle moral tone, it avoids explicit statement; emotional honesty is undercut by abstraction of the “shared joy” payoff.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyrical voice is consistent, textured diction (“photon-kissed pigment,” “mist kissed her cheeks”) aligns with artist’s perception. Rhythm modulates well between breath-long descriptive spans and clipped beats; no head-hopping; register maintains poetic modesty appropriate to focalizer.</comment>

<comment>Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence lengths; occasional “luminous,” “folded” repeats are within tolerance. Information dense; metaphor vehicles harmoniously orbit light and fog. No clarity errors or redundancy in peak images; final dissolution of fragment is clean and vivid.</comment>

<comment>Glow-painting as restorative ritual is fresh but not fully transformational; the core premise remains recognizably an allegory of art versus despair. Fresco-as-film exposure reuses an existing metaphoric light gimmick, though the integration into misty orchard locale feels specific and earns mild uplift.</comment>
