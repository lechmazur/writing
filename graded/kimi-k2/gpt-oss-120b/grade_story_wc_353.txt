<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior motive (“fierce need to create”) and embodied emotion sustain through tactile craft; micro-choices of reed placement and crack-reading reveal hierarchy of values; quill dance of hedgehog supplies visible cost. Yet the closing smile risks epiphany-summary (“realized that empathy in motion…”) without immediate, specific embodied repercussion, softening full contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selected lens: Accumulative/Textural; gradual resonance layers reweight the final image. Closure effect: resonant reconfiguration – “the grove finally heard a song that had never been spoken” crystallizes the stake with felt cost (sculpture forever changed, silence breached). Orientation swift; no causality breaks; cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wood, fracture veins, and mossy stone are visceral tools that physically constrain reed placement and crack angle – integrated into action rather than backdrop. Porcelain also functions as micro-setting by altering acoustic propagation. Yet global place anchor (grove boundaries, cardinal light) remains faint, preventing 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “wrest music from muteness.” Pressure deepens with each deciphered crack until final cadence forecloses silence forever – single decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Cost felt via irreversible sculpture transformation and faintly glimmering sentinel porcelaine; no external reversals required.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of auditory empathy emerges organically from successive cracks made chord, final twilight chord left echoing non-literally. No moralizing lines. Subtext resides in hedgehog quiver and owl emergence, not statement. Ends with resonant image rather than thesis.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Lush lyricism sustained yet disciplined, syntactically coherent, perceptual signature (tree-song sculptor’s synesthetic hearing) consistent. No POV leakage or dialogue contamination. Cadence undulates with crack tension without monotony. Compression taught early: “where the leaves whispered like distant flutes.”</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied, strong nouns/verbs (“ridges of resonance,” “porcelain hum”). One scaffold repeat: “intensely quiet hush”/“intensely quiet glow” flags template cadence but not overdone; no figurative muddle in climax. Prose remains highly dense, zero redundancy that dulls final note.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Cracks-as-score, porcelain-as-amplifier, hedgehog-as-first-dancers – fresh synthesis rooted in setting rather than mere novelty. No close echoes from extant texts. The grove muteness flipped to sounding archive feels inevitable after line 1. Risk distinction awarded for quiet inversion of loud climax.</question>
