<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—calm vs fury—drives the decisive slice, but the “ego death survivor” label stays abstract; embodied emotion arrives only in the final surge. The micro-choice to slice the jar is earned, yet the Duplicate’s agency remains off-stage, muting relationship crucible. Backstory is minimal and anchored, so no BRR breach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens holds: slice → crack → pulse → shared stewardship. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (glass shards, twin heartbeat). Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis between factions’ shouts and Kael’s silence, but the beat still advances.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating basalt, glass cylinder, and dawn light are selective and tactile; the platform’s height constrains the final ascent. Sensory hierarchy favors visual and haptic detail filtered through Kael’s urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from center to cliffside. No static repetition; environment evolves with the crack.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore feeling vs leave the Duplicate sealed—is signaled early and tightened by the slice. Agency is Kael’s alone; the factions complicate but do not resolve. Cost is the literal breach of containment and the emotional flood that follows. One meaningful escalation: silence → blade → luminous torrent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding self through complementary opposites emerges from action, not statement; the paradox blade is image, not thesis. Subtext lives in the factions’ lowered weapons and the shared heartbeat. Final image reweights the premise: original and duplicate coexist without theft. No moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the dojo’s mythic register. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences for calm, staccato for the slice. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven; silence carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs and concrete nouns; occasional stacked modifiers (“luminous fluid that swirled”) but not in peak beats. No loops or synonym churn. Sentence variety supports momentum. One passive (“was known”) but justified for backstory compression. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of ego death, floating dojo, and paradox blade feels fresh; tropes are transformed through Kael’s embodied cost. The custody battle becomes partnership without cliché resolution. Specific detail—“bioluminescent veins”—anchors the speculative frame. Risk in conceptual blade pays off.</comment>
