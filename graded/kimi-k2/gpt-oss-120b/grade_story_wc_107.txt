<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “weighty lightness” motive is dramatized through micro-choices (narrating valves, coaxing silica). Yet the shift from external ritual to internal renunciation of control is slightly under-cooked; the cost of abandoning quick safety is asserted rather than felt in a single crystallizing beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s whispered promise reweights the entire scene from cold command to hopeful cradle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each glass vessel and narrated task layers density until the final glow reconfigures meaning. Cost is visible in the cracked bookmark’s “new beginning” and the surrendered illusion of control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The thawing control room is tactile—ice sheets, liquid-glass puddles, furnace flicker—and the glass sphere becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; environment constrains Mara’s slow craft and mirrors her interior thaw. One more sensory anchor (sound of dripping valves) would have nudged 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“craft safe zones for inquiry”—is signaled early and tightened by the accumulating glass vials. Escalation is textural: each etched heart and cooling tray deepens the cost of patience. The final stance crystallizes when Mara renounces speed; the felt price is the time she cannot reclaim, though it could be sharper on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragile equilibrium emerges from glass craft and climate thaw without overt statement. Subtext lives in gesture: cracked bookmark = broken past repurposed, glass sphere = miniature planet. Final image reframes the entire narrative as cradle rather than ruin, offering resonant ambiguity rather than moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; Mara’s narrated liturgy (“I lift the rod…”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in closure. Syntax modulates with emotional heat—long breathy clauses during blowing, clipped fragments at dusk. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers craft detail or atmospheric charge. Occasional soft fillers (“seemed to laugh”) slightly dilute peak beats, and one mixed metaphor (“thawing heart of the planet pulse in tandem”) momentarily jars. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of glassblowing and climate grief feels fresh; the control-room-as-cradle inversion is non-obvious and earned. Recurring glass-heart motif is specific rather than symbolic ornament. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off, though proximity to familiar eco-poetry tropes keeps it just shy of 9+.</comment>
