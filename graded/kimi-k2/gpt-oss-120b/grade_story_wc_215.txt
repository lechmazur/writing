<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“eyes held the calm of a stone lake”), yet motivation crystallizes late—only when he lifts the box does the cost of silence become visceral. The recluse’s choice to endure muteness is credible, but the shift from passive observer to active guardian feels slightly under-motivated until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image of ash, glass, and ghost layers pressure until the final reconfiguration—his alignment of the box with the sun reframes the covenant. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the molten amber tear seals the pact with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The scorched oasis, glass house, and stained box form a micro-setting that literally constrains the final gesture—sunlight must pass through the box to reseal the covenant. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air hummed with a memory of honey”). The box as setting-object charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve silence—tightens once: the realization that breaking the covenant would “unleash a scream louder than any wind” forces the choice to endure muteness. Cost is visible in the amber tear that burns the earth. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the triad of man, bee, spirit bound to mutual silence; no moralizing. The final image reframes the entire narrative as a meditation on memory’s weight without stating it. Subtext operates in gesture—the ghosts’ slow dance is the unspoken poem.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, incantatory, and consistent; perceptual signature is stone-lake calm. No dialogue; lyric elision (“mute eloquence”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences collapse into the single tear.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every image does double duty. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“tangled covenant”) is earned by context. Final paragraph’s molten amber is precise and propulsive.</comment>

<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper tending a covenant of silence is fresh; the stained-glass box as memory reliquary is specific and irreplicable. Transformation test fails—this could not swap settings without collapse. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
