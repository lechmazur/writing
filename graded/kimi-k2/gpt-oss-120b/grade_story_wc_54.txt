<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete—“stoic wonder” embodied in brass, dust, humming panels—but lacks contradictory impulse at critical beats; the final smile feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain—“therefore she rerouted”—escalates from idle scan to voltage arc to beacon; closure delivers undeniable conceptual repricing: hope scripted into circuitry at measurable social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terminal’s geometry (conduit as artery, cracked glass vaulting night), the sextant brass, and faint carnival dust together constrain spatial tactics and charge the final window-burst with earned awe.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning abandoned ruin into regenerative node—tightens one dramatic turn that forecloses abandonment at the cost of ethical labor never paid by carnival producers; pressure legible without superfluous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resurrection as ongoing moral equation not moral lesson emerges from brass angle, humming servos, and beacon trajectory; theme refrains from overt thesis while letting redirected current speak for future debt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close anchors in engineering perception; syntax mirrors calculation (“she traced… rerouted… drafted”), rhythmic propulsion tightens under pressure, though occasional elevated cadence flirts with lyric essay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs—place, pressure, metaphor—yet “maze of intentions” phrase repeats once without added torque; a single near-duplicate loop keeps this category just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Engineering resurrection carnival-aftermath mash-up delivers fresh inflection; unlikely synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and sextant piece bridges epochs without gimmickry, elevating familiar salvage into singular vision.</comment>
