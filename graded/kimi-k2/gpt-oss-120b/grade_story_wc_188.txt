<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Designer’s interiority is vivid—contradictory impulses of playfulness and resolve embodied in the rag-knot ritual—but the final vow feels slightly abstract, lacking a concrete cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chant and spark layers density until the mosaic tile glows, reconfiguring hope. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost—the fortress’s pulse now demands return—though the causal chain could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Blooming fortress walls and kerosene scent constrain movement and mood; the rag-knot itself becomes micro-setting that filters breath into light. Final image of vines cradling fireworks charges the scene with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—escalates through each spark that completes the mosaic note. One decisive intensification: the burst that reveals the glowing tile, narrowing options to perpetual return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of filtering despair through art emerges organically from the rag-knot’s alchemy and mosaic completion. Final reprise of chant and fire offers resonant, non-moral answer: light persists because someone keeps walking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature—petals catching amber, oily threads catching wind. Patterned elision taught early (“note in mosaic”) and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“velvet blank that swallowed hope”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold in peak beats; rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fireworks as moving mosaic tiles, fortress as living canvas. Risky lyric structure commits fully and lands; transformation test passed—story collapses without rag-knot and chant.</comment>
