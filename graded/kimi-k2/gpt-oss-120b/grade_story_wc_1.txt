<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elya’s embodied tremor and tactile memory of heat ground her interiority; the ledger strip becomes a concrete pivot that re-weights her purpose. Yet the shift from “must retrace” to “understood then” is compressed into summary, muting the cost of adaptation. Her final act of tucking the strip into the kiln base offers a quiet Earned Stasis, but the emotional price feels generalized rather than singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous shards refract starlight into a new kiln song, re-weighting loss into purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each frost pattern and ledger mark layers density until the final image crystallizes. A slight ellipsis between finding the glass and firing it weakens causal immediacy, but the cost is legible in the glowing canyon walls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The canyon’s glass-tower walls and frost-veined basalt constrain Elya’s path and echo her fragile medium; the kiln’s remaining glow and charcoal stacks provide tactile resources that shape her next move. Selective sensory detail (cool stone palms, amber pulse of shards) keeps atmosphere taut. The setting’s mirrored colors at the end charge the closure image, though a few phrases drift toward scenic postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after fire—is signaled early and tightened when the ledger forces a literal retracing. One meaningful deepening occurs as frost patterns melt into a hidden groove, narrowing options to the mine. Cost is visible in soot-stained hands and the kiln’s scarred base, yet the escalation feels more accumulative than decisively irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through fracture emerges organically from glass, frost, and fire; no explicit moralizing intrudes. The final image of “purpose lived… in the quiet pauses where light lingered” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext hums in the ledger’s dual role as contraband map and scarred testament, though a touch of lyrical excess nudges it toward the sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a luminous, glass-brittle texture—syntax fractures and rejoins like molten silica. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elya notices heat, translucence, and resonance before anything else. Compression and elision (“she understood then”) are taught early and paid off in the kiln’s final chord. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional stacked modifiers (“glassy hush that seemed to breathe with the wind”) flirt with overwriting but serve atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates with scene heat. One mixed metaphor—“charcoal stacked like black snow”—momentarily jars.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing glass art, smuggler cartography, and frost patterns yields a fresh synthesis; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes—this story could not swap settings without collapse. Risk lies in the lyric mode itself, but it heightens stakes without gimmickry. A half-point deduction for faint echoes of “artist reborn from ashes” trope.</comment>
