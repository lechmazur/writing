<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied (trembling fingertip, smile softening sarcasm) and her motive—map the rivers’ birth—drives every beat. The phrasebook’s dog-ear and condensation pattern act as externalized thought, forcing micro-choices that reveal her under pressure. A credible renunciation/acceptance of risk is present when she steps outside to record the first coordinates, sealing her path. Minor: “subtly confident” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the thaw begins and Mara commits to mapping the origin, cost crystallized in the bell tolling and the falcon’s shadow. Causal chain (condensation → glyph → transmitter → bell) holds; no orientation debt. One smooth transition (inside→outside) respects scope. Lens: Causal with accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Outpost, lake, lamp glass, and transmitter are tactile and constrain action—glass must be warmed, antenna aligned. Weather and metal fatigue mirror internal dread. The frozen lake’s crack supplies the decisive environmental cue. Micro-setting (glass pane) literally becomes the map, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the rivers’ hidden source—tightens when the condensation pattern offers a single route, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is one deepening: thaw begins, bell tolls, choice locked. Cost is felt in the “calm that bordered on dread.” Agency: aligning transmitter and stepping outside.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: every river born of ice, ice born of silence. Subtext in the falcon’s cyclical return and the bell’s first clang. No moralizing; final image of the thin vein of water reweights the quest without statement. Ambiguity lingers—will the map save or doom the world?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices “mirror-like hush,” “iron and old promises,” condensation “like veins.” Syntax tightens under pressure; no head-hopping. Free indirect style stays coherent; diction fits an editor who reads marginalia. Rhythm modulates with scene heat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density, no loops. Figurative language is selective: “dog-ear curled like a tired ear” earns its place. Sentence rhythm accelerates as droplets stream. Occasional elevated diction (“singular convergence”) is POV-consistent. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cartographer uses condensation as living map, phrasebook as herald. Falcon and bell create mythic but grounded stakes. Transformation test fails if swapped—details are specific to Mara’s vocation. Risk in lyric condensation pattern pays off.</comment>
