<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied, but the fisher’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly risks or costs him until the final spike-lift, so the change feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fisher’s wordless chant merges spike and constellations, reconfiguring the garden’s map with felt cosmic cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break and cadence shift are legible—though causality between steps is more associative than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is evoked through synesthetic motion—“pathways rippled like invisible chords”—and the rail spike’s vibration anchors the final image, constraining the fisher’s stance. Selective sensory detail keeps the micro-setting alive without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightens once when the constellations tangle; the cost is the fisher’s surrender of control, visible in the spike’s celestial fire. Agency drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-creation emerges through concrete particulars: the fisher’s transliterating heart, the spike’s hum, the reeds’ heartbeat chorus. Final image offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, musical, internally consistent. Patterned elision (“a hush fell, not silence but a presence that sang by voicing silence”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“midnight flowers that opened when patterns break themselves”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure beat. Rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic myth with tactile fishing ritual feels fresh; the rail spike as tuning fork to heaven is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
