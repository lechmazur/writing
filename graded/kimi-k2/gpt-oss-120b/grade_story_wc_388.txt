<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s drive to excavate truth is clear and consistent, but interiority stays at surface level—no contradictory impulses shown under pressure. The final “stillpoint” realization lands as an abstract epiphany rather than a choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; her smile feels generic rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: rumor → map → diamond → stillpoint. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing (“truth blooms”), but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page. Orientation is swift; no temporal or spatial drift. Mosaic shards are absent; single-scene default holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wasteland orchard is vividly sketched—radioactive dust, phosphorescent fruit, rusted table—each detail filters through Mira’s goal-directed attention. The gnarled apple tree constrains the final dig, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is tight; no static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the stillpoint—is signaled early and escalates via map reconstruction. Pressure tightens once when storms cease, but agency is largely investigative rather than decisive; the diamond’s “stillness” resolves the conflict without a visible trade-off. Cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. corporate lies emerges organically through Mira’s actions; the diamond’s inscription offers a resonant, non-literal payoff. Subtext in shredded letters and orchard silence avoids overt moralizing. Final image reweights earlier decay into sanctuary without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, with occasional elevated turns (“phosphorescent sheen”) that fit her observant lens. Rhythm modulates with scene tension; no syntactic monotony. Dialogue is absent, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional figurative flourishes (“wounded star”) are purposeful and brief. Density is high; each sentence advances scene or stakes. No grammar slips or clarity issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard + cursed diamond + truth-seeker is a fresh synthesis; the stillpoint-as-mind-state twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Corporate smokescreen trope is grounded in specific shredded letters rather than generic conspiracy. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
