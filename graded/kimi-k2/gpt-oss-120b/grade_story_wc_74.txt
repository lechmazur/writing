<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s insomnia and hopefulness are embodied in tactile brushwork and moonlit ritual, but her interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“mind forever wandering”) rather than contradictory impulse under pressure; the final renunciation of rest is implied, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of pigment and moonlight thickens the pattern until the courier’s memory reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the greenhouse becomes a “saffron-lit bridge”—with felt cost in Mara’s sleepless vigil, though the beat is slightly diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass, smog, and moon-speckled vines constrain every choice: rain collector limits brush-cleaning, moon angle dictates working hours. Micro-setting (moon-tipped brush as tool-setting) charges the final image when silvered sap glows over rooftops.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rousing strangers through art—tightens when Jiro’s remembered kindness proves the gamble worthwhile. Pressure is accretive, not causal; the courier’s pause is coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying lens rules.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of anonymous kindness emerges through image (glowing letters, folded notes) rather than statement. Final rooftop lexicon offers resonant, non-literal answer: memory resurrected in pigment. One soft echo—“quiet power of a single kind gesture”—skates close to thesis but lands within tolerance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: saffron, soot, silvered sap recur with purpose. Syntax mirrors painterly layering; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“visual lexicon of remembrance”) fits Mara’s artistic lexicon and is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers color or light. One paraphrase loop (“each stroke a promise… each hue a patient hymn”) and a mixed metaphor (“gentle tides coaxing a hidden shore”) slightly dull the peak, yet momentum survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of insomnia, moonlit calligraphy, and smog-city rooftop feels fresh; lost-language conceit is transformed through pigment rather than trope. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in final reconfiguration, though premise edges close to familiar “artist as healer” arc.</comment>
