<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“each breath a question”), but the visionary’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; her final choice to become “bridge” feels foregone rather than wrested from genuine flaw. Motivation is clear yet lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scar-linking and light pulses tightens toward the beacon ignition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—portal opens, covenant sealed—but the cost is more luminous than visceral; still, the before/after is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade and moon-metal clipping are vivid and selective; the clipping constrains the final act and recharges the glade’s hue. Spatial choreography is coherent, though “root-bound” body-as-setting could be even more tactile under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“bind dream to duty”—is signaled early and escalates through hedge-scar mapping and portal opening. One meaningful tightening: maze parts only after visionary accepts collective longing. Cost is present but diffuse; stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective dreams shaping destiny emerges organically from the covenant ritual; final beacon image reweights earlier scars as luminous threads. Avoids moralizing, but the conceptual leap is so compressed it risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific (“hair tangled like ancient vines”). Patterned elision taught early (“time folded”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within visionary’s mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous threads of hope”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pulse. Minor register drift toward oracular abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hedge-maze portal fantasy with collective-memory myth; transformation test passes—story would collapse without scar-linking mechanic. Takes formal risk with lyric accumulation that heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
