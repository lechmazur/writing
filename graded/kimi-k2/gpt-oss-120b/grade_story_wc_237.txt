<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific; the scars-as-runes device shows contradictory impulses (heal vs. hide). Motivation is legible early and drives every beat. The final transformation of scars into luminous runes is earned by the ritual sequence, with visible cost in the dissolved feather and glowing arms. Some emotional phrasing edges toward lyric abstraction but never breaks character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scars become stories, re-weighting Lira’s past. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (tea steam, crystal shards, jasmine wind) intensifies until the final mist dissolves the scars’ weight. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the feather’s dissolution and the platform’s slow descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The floating rock, moonstone tea set, and crystallizing quill are vivid, selective, and constrain choice (the quill must be dipped, the platform’s height isolates). Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira’s scholar-poet lens. The setting quietly guides the ritual; no exposition dumps. Micro-setting (tea basin) charges the final image. Could edge higher if spatial choreography were tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into healing stories—is signaled early and tightened through ritual escalation. Each beat (dip quill, crystal flare, mist release) narrows options until the scars glow as runes. Agency is Lira’s throughout; coincidence absent. Cost is felt in the feather’s loss and the irreversible glow. Slight reserve: the pressure curve is more accumulative than sharply escalated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as both wound and wisdom. Subtext lives in gesture—the feather’s silent fall, the whispered chant. Final image reweights scars from shame to purpose without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity lingers in the “saturated hush.” One soft echo: “Let the wind carry…” flirts with aphorism but is grounded by ritual context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature is scholar-poet, attuned to glyphs, wind, and scent. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during crystal flare, longer breaths during descent. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (grandmother’s full chant) taught early and paid off. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each image does double duty (tea steam = time dilation, jasmine = memory). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise: “crystallizes when stressed” is physical and emotional. Minor density spike—“saturated hush” repeated—but pattern-earned. Final chime lands clean. One typo risk: “softly brightly” could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of rune scholarship, floating tea ritual, and scar-transformation feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (healing ritual, memory scars) are re-cast through tactile specificity. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off; no gimmickry. The crow-quill’s crystallizing stress is a novel constraint. Derivative-premise guardrail waived.</comment>
