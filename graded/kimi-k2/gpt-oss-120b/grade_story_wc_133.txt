<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s insomnia and grief-rooted drive are embodied in concrete micro-choices (slipping boots, lifting the brooch) and culminate in the felt cost of surrendering her canvases; the interior contradiction between preserving art and seeking renewal is dramatized rather than stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange of paintings for the pulse reweights Mara’s world, cost visible in the mist-varnished cliffs. Causal chain holds—rain trail → brooch → altar → tremor—without gaps; orientation is anchored early and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught by the pattern of rain trails and color.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cracked basalt, salt-slick stones, and mist gutters are filtered through Mara’s painterly perception; the amber brooch and altar function as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Weather and terrain actively shape tactics—slipping on algae, rain spiraling into the column—charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore balance via convergence—is signaled early and tightened when the voice demands the paintings in exchange; the single deepening (spiral of water, island tremor) narrows options and exacts visible cost. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of meaning-through-sacrifice emerges from the concrete exchange; no moralizing, only the final ribbon-of-rain image reconfigures prior grief into hope. Subtext resides in the silence after the tremor and the mist that “varnishes” the cliffs—memory preserved at cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct painterly perceptual signature—“colors that refused to settle into sleep,” “haggard awe”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the tremor. No head-hopping; diction stays within Mara’s lexicon; purposeful compression (“wryly earnest”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density, vivid specificity (“salt-slick stones,” “pulse like a heartbeat”), and zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors serve clarity; no mixed vehicles. Final line’s cadence crystallizes the closure image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-war tidal island and rain-convergence myth are synthesized through Mara’s idiosyncratic grief-art exchange; the amber brooch as compass feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
