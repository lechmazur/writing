<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A vivid, specific persona whose embodied discipline (heart-rhythm bowing) undercuts the melodrama and keeps interiority concrete; final renunciation lands with palpable cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal arc holds: heart-signal method taught early → escalates statue tension → earns rooted finale; closure image reweights the entire orchard in one heartbeat-guided bow stroke.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orchard’s statues, apples, and ambient glow are never décor; each constrains movement, supplies allies, then mutate from guards to gardeners, directly shaping the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Beauty vs oppression theme emerges from violinist’s choice to renounce fame for root-work; final image of one empty locust beacon reweights the cost without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh hinge: mechanical bards planting reclaiming vines feels inevitable yet risky; tarnished-wonder tone never slips into saccharine or postapocalyptic cliché.</comment>
