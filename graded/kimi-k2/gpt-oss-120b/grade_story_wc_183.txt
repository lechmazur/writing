<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but abstract; the chimera’s contradictory impulses (“blissfully aberrant” vs. “half-remembered maps”) are stated rather than dramatized in micro-choice. The final gathering of blossoms earns a credible renunciation, yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship breathes and turns toward a horizon of letters, reweighting the premise with visible cost (the discoverer’s promise to catalog silence). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of ink-river and glowing threads taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the carnival ship’s cracked mirrors and backward-flowing ink constrain navigation and supply the narrative threads. Fog and rust act as tactile pressure, charging the final image when lights flicker back to life.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering verses to reach the garden—is signaled early and tightened once when the ink river demands a dive. Cost is visible (immersion in centuries of solace), though escalation is single-note rather than layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “trapped freedom” emerges through the paradox of cage and wind; final image of the moving ship reconfigures the concept without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture (pressing card into rusted slot) rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with patterned elision (“stitched feathers and rusted brass”) taught early and sustained. Perceptual signature is distinct—POV filters world through cartographic memory and carousel music—without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“rusted chains of light”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative texture. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor register drift into poetic abstraction keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise fuses carnival dereliction with cartographic chimera in a non-obvious synthesis; backward-flowing ink as memory river feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric, non-linear) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
