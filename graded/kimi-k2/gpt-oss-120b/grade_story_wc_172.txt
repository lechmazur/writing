<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid—profit-driven cruelty vs secret tenderness—as embodied in the act of cradling the egg. Each choice aligns with his amoral code, yet the tear redeems nothing. Backstory/fragment reflection anchors only in present action (cracking the egg), so stays well under limit. Single micro-choice at release reweights his world, earning the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: manufactured drought → cracked map → egg placement → sonic preservation. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: the reverberating echo is legible before/after the drought. Cost crystallizes in the “sand-tasting tear”—felt on the page. Orientation anchored in first paragraph with brine-pool, case, and wire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt-flat setting is never static; cracks act as both map and amplifier, constraining his foot-path and the final acoustic placement. Quartz case, brine pool, and distant thunder all participate in climax. Select detail—“sky bruised,” “mineral surface”—tunes emotional register. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will he preserve the bird’s echo at the price of engineered drought. Single escalation: the wind’s pause sharpens the moment to crack or relent, tightening option space. Agency stays his each step; resonance lands the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme accrues from concrete: drought as self-infliction, echo as legacy. Final image of sound spiraling upward offers Conceptual Repricing—heritage carved from cruelty, no moral tagged on. Subtext surfaces in tactile details rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice stays consistently distanced and precise, matching the philanthropist’s clinical removal. No head-hops; internal monologue is filtered through sensory observation (“salt flat caught the vibration”). Cadence modulates under pressure—short crack, long thunder lull. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences snap with high density (“salt flat caught the vibration, sending it spiraling upward”). No paraphrase loops. Metaphors serve action: cracks as map, brine as amplifier. Final beat prose is clean—“scattered the sound like broken glass that somehow felt whole”—perfect sonic image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Fresh synthesis—manufactured drought as memory device, extinction re-sung by its own erasure. Risk of amorality pays off with felt cost on closure. No familiar phrases echo; everything arises from place, physics, and flawed motive.</comment>
