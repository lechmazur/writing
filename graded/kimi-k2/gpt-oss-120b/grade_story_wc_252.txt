<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—protector vs. escapee—are embodied in her dock-work rhythm and the scrimshaw’s pulse; the final renunciation of violence carries visible cost when she releases the bone to the whale. Interiority is concrete, but a few stock phrases (“combat within herself”) slightly dilute specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the island’s heart beats inside Mara, foreclosing her old combative stance. Causal chain (scrimshaw → whale call → crystal flare → spirits freed) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the salt-spray vortex is the felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe, wet dock planks, and phosphorescent cliffs are vivid and selective; the scrimshaw itself functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. One minor drift: “earth itself seemed to shrink” momentarily breaks spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. guardianship—tightens when the whale’s call forces Mara to choose between keeping the scrimshaw or releasing it. The cost (loss of talisman, internalized island heart) is legible, though escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of detachment from violence emerges through image and action; the final dawn calm reweights earlier bruised horizons without moralizing. One near-label—“freedom in embracing her true nature”—slips into abstraction at the close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture with rhythmic control (“seafoam clung to stone,” “whale’s hymn rose like a blade”) sustains a consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; minor cadence repetition in “combative tenderness” refrain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful. A few mixed metaphors (“blade” vs. “hymn”) and one scaffold phrase (“the weight of centuries lift”) slightly blunt the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar maritime mythos is transformed through Mara's embodied labor and the whale-crystal nexus; the disappearing island as crucible for non-violence feels fresh. Risk-taking in lyric escalation pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
