<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (scarf fluttering like a forgotten stanza), but her choices remain observational; the reawakening happens *through* her rather than *by* her. The final beat—tucking the scarf and logging the event—shows a quiet stewardship that forecloses no path, so the cost is diffuse. Still, her perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the luminous projection reconfigures the patrons’ experience and the library’s ambient silence into shared communion, with the scarf’s hum promising recurrence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift replace causal reversals—yet the cost (Mara’s perpetual vigil) is only implied, not dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scientific-poetry library is rendered with synesthetic precision—vellum rustle, ozone-ink scent, particle-theory verses—while the scarf functions as micro-setting that constrains Mara’s method. Spatial choreography is flawless; the hyperbolic curvature is taught through tactile action (tracing ceiling angles) rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>The dominant stake—keeping analog memories alive—intensifies via pattern accumulation (each page-turn a chord, each scarf pulse a ripple), but the tightening is diffuse; no single choice narrows options. Pressure is atmospheric, not decisive. The cost is conceptual (perpetual stewardship) rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as non-Euclidean geometry, stories as living curvature. The final image of constellations on the ceiling reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the scarf’s emerald shimmer and the ozone scent—implications of sacrifice and continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“quiet rustle of vellum and electronic sighs”). POV remains tightly focalized through Mara’s perceptual bias; no head-hopping. The elevated diction feels earned by the library’s premise and never drifts into corporate register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; every sentence layers image and concept (“ink and photon,” “Möbius strip of story”). Occasional soft-focus phrases (“gentle pull toward the place”) slightly dilute momentum, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of quantum geometry and library mysticism feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The scarf-as-conduit and hyperbolic map are fresh inflections on memory-as-space tropes. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
