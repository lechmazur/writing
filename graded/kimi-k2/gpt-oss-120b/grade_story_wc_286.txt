<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and consistent—her calloused hands, the lantern’s warmth against her palm—but the “fractured timelines” belief is asserted rather than dramatized as a contradictory impulse. The final choice to leave the lantern is credible, yet the cost feels generalized (“sharp gentleness”) rather than specific to her flaw or desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s steady amber signals the oasis’s new pulse, and the cost is the irreversible entrusting of her own “sun” to the place. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light, thrum, and breath layers until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cracked salt crust, dead beehive, and cactus shade are vivid and selective, filtering through Mara’s potter-eye for texture. The lantern’s glow on bee wings in the final image constrains the choice to leave it behind, charging closure. Minor drift: “chimney smoke” feels unmotivated in a beekeeping oasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing the oasis to breathe again—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each pulse of thrum and lantern glow tightens the weave of past and present until the hive reawakens. Cost is legible in the surrender of the lantern, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of kindness as non-coercive change emerges through the lantern’s phototropic response and the bees’ tentative return. Final image of “layers of light waiting to be coaxed” offers resonant, non-moralizing closure. Avoids explicit thesis until the penultimate paragraph’s “reminder,” which grazes thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail—“each footstep a soft echo on cracked clay tiles.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping. The slight elevation in diction (“benediction,” “phototropic”) is consistent with Mara’s contemplative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“sharp gentleness” appears twice). Metaphors are coherent—“lantern light scattering like gentle rain” sustains the phototropic motif. No artifacts in the closure beat; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phototropic lantern + fractured timelines + beekeeping oasis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative structure; it pays off in the final reconfiguration. Minor deduction for echo of familiar eco-mythic tropes.</comment>
