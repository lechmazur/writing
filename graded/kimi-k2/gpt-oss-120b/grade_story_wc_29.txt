<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt a cautiously hopeful surge”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final “soft tone” transmits hope without visible personal cost, so the arc feels more symbolic than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes a “lighthouse,” the valley a “chorus,” with conceptual cost (permanent vigilance). Causal chain holds—subsonic interference → false-alarm defused → unity—but the dean’s emergency assembly resolves off-stage, softening the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio station’s “dust-touched charts” and flickering console anchor space; the low-frequency transmitter constrains tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the cosmic backdrop leans on legend rather than tactile presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing chaos sown by cosmic tricksters—is signaled early and tightened when the false solar-flare alarm is neutralized. Agency is clear: Mara’s interference rewrites the signal. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of unity-through-delicate-interference emerges organically from beats; the “ethereal grit” image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the humming crowd and final shimmer avoids overt statement, though the prophecy note edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in radio tech idiom; perceptual signature is consistent (“celestial signal interpreter,” “stellar arc into resonant waveform”). No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“canvas for the celestial signal interpreter,” “mirror shattered by unseen forces”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-trickster premise is familiar, yet the fusion of subsonic counter-broadcast with campus politics feels fresh. Specificity of kitchen-appliance tuning and firehouse radio chorus transforms trope into lived texture.</comment>
