<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction—seeking scientific clarity yet using a talismanic patch—gives immediate specificity; her final whispered command embodies the "cultivate foresight" motif with visible cost (she surrenders the data and stands alone). Still, the prose flirts with stock metaphors ("shadows like hopeful fingers") and the compass patch remains more emblem than embodied tool during action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural arc is coherent: pattern of wind traces narrows to one charged point, then a gentle breath dissipates the pressure; Earned Stasis is visible at the line “the singular convergence folded onto itself.” However, no felt personal loss is dramatized—only professional completion—so the cost is visible but lightweight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concrete anchor: rust-echoing port, labyrinth of containers, red needle trembling—each tactile detail filters through Mara’s survey mindset. The compass patch returns at closure, re-weighted; thus setting plus prop charges the final image under the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—read the wind or the city stays dead—tightens decisively at the anemometer’s trembling needle and spirals into the tower sigh; no meaningful reversal, yet the pressure folds rather than resolves, satisfying the lens. Missing visceral personal loss holds it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>The theme—responsibility for foresight—arises from wind patterns and lived containers, not assertion; final image of patch in pocket reconfigures prior tension. The moral remains untidily weighted: Mara succeeds yet cannot foresee everything, offering earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>The compressed lyric voice stays consistent in synesthetic observation (“wind curd like ghosts”), though once edges into overwriting (“hopeful fingers across cracked pavement”). Focalization holds; near end a brief register drift into the airy (“gentle sigh”) doesn’t damage pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>High information density; syntax varies with breath. Only minor loops—“shift, altered flow, shift again,” “document the final wind shift”—pull 0.2 artifact, not fatal. Clear propulsion to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>A quiet but precise transformation of post-storm procedural into meditative lyric; the port-container labyrinth plus scientific divination feels fresh, not template. Compass-patch talisman re-weights meaning at end, a deliberate callback.</comment>
