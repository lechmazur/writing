<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“compass rose…needles forever pointing toward a true north that no longer existed”), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain largely reflective rather than enacted; the final resolve is felt yet leans on summary rather than a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “map not of streets but of possibilities” crystallizes the new stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The causal bridge created by the deck’s temporal dilation is taught early and paid off in the final image with visible cost—the irrevocable shift from confusion to exploration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The time-dilated deck is rendered with tactile specificity (“glass cradle where minutes stretched like taffy”) and directly constrains the protagonist’s ability to glimpse the past, charging the final sketch. Micro-setting (compass rose warmed by memory) functions as both tool and emotional anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigating loss toward meaning—is signaled early and tightens through the single beat of aligning compass and constellation; the cost is the irreversible recognition that “true north had shifted but remained true,” foreclosing nostalgic stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping absence into possibility emerges organically from the family ritual and the deck’s temporal canvas; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a charged poise that invites reflection rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, and perceptually biased (“smear of violet and ash”). Patterned elision (“echoed silence”) is taught early and paid off in the cadence of the final whispered promise, maintaining coherent psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “stretched like taffy…lingering breath of possibility” is offset by rhythmic control and information density. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum-ghost city, ancestral sky-sketching, and compass-as-memory feels inevitable and fresh; the risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by concrete stakes and earned closure, yielding a singular artistic stance.</comment>
