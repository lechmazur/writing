<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “quiet current beneath the city’s bright glare” and the embodied dread that “dissolves into quiet resolve” anchor her arc. Motivation (question the watchers to save the city) is consistent and intensifies through micro-choices: tracing shell ridges, blowing the whistle, sealing the mosaic. The final renunciation—vowing to keep listening—earns its cost by the prior discovery that the city had stopped listening. Flaw: the shift from “question” to “promise” is slightly under-dramatized in a single clause.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes into “vowed to keep listening,” reweighting the premise with felt cost. Causal chain holds—each whistle blast tightens the linkage between shell pattern, watcher response, and her new cartographic vow. One transition (tunnel emergence) is clean. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end. Minor slack: the watchers’ light-language arrives as gift rather than earned negotiation, softening the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The turtle shells as layered “ancient scarps” and the “amber dread” light are selective, sensory, and constrain every move—streets, corridors, even the cracked mosaic are literally shell-bound. The reed whistle and mosaic shards function as micro-settings that gate passage. Final image of “shells humming with pattern languages” recharges the opening vista. No orientation drift; geography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent Shellhaven’s fossilization—is signaled early and escalates through pattern decoding and watcher contact. One decisive tightening: the tunnel opens only at solar zenith, forcing immediate exit. Cost is conceptual—the city’s “lost willingness to listen” is exposed—but could be more viscerally felt on Mira’s body or tools. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening as survival emerges organically from shell-script, whistle resonance, and the final vow. Subtext in the watchers’ wordless light-pattern avoids moralizing. The cracked mosaic as “language of fracture” elegantly reweights the idea of brokenness as map. Final image offers non-literal resonance without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“molten ribbon,” “warning feather”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during tunnel emergence. POV stays tightly anchored to Mira’s perception; no head-hop. Compression (“sunwashed dread dissolve”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct perceptual signature: she reads the world as cartographer—angles, spirals, coordinates.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers map, shell, sea, and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent—“pattern languages,” “language of fracture.” No loops, no scaffold. One near-mixed image: “molten ribbon” horizon is briefly at odds with “sapphire sea,” but context resolves. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>City on swimming turtles, cartographer who maps living shells, and watchers who speak in wave-light: synthesis feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The transformation test fails—this could not be relocated without structural collapse. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
