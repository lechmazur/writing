<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chronicler’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet remains abstract; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure is dramatized. Her “discovery” is reported rather than enacted, so the cost feels diffuse. The final smile is earned but the emotional arc is more observed than inhabited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pause thins, the leaders soften, the chronicler’s stance crystallizes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple and cicada note layers until the final image reweights meaning. Causality is oblique but coherent; the cost is the chronicler’s relinquishment of predictive certainty in favor of felt transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto, pool, and jade cicada are rendered with tactile specificity; starlight on lacquer and water constrains attention and charges the final mirror image. Spatial choreography is clear; the lantern, notebook, and basalt slab are handled in lived-in ways. The setting subtly guides the chronicler’s method and the story’s rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the texture of the pause between rival clans—is signaled early and tightened through sensory accumulation rather than overt confrontation. Agency is the chronicler’s attention itself, which forecloses the path of prophecy in favor of witnessing; the cost is the surrender of predictive authority. Pressure deepens via pattern rather than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as tidal return, pride as mutable surface. The proverb and cicada refrain reweight without moralizing. Final image of the chronicler slipping back into the tide offers a non-literal answer—transition as perpetual motion rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific; the chronicler’s noticing is biased toward shimmer and hush. Syntax modulates with the moon’s climb and the cicada’s trill. No head-hopping; distance remains intimate yet restrained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of loops; figurative language serves atmosphere without clutter. Occasional soft-focus abstractions (“whispered promise,” “texture of time”) slightly dilute precision. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal chronicler as mediator of clan pause feels fresh; the cicada as sonic map of transition is a non-obvious synthesis. Familiar motifs (mirror pool, starlight) are transformed through sensory method rather than ornament. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
