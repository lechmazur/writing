<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt the ember’s heat travel through the silk like a secret signal”), but the final choice—slipping the chart into a courier’s satchel—feels slightly under-motivated; we see no moment of doubt or cost that would make the renunciation sting. The contradiction between wisdom and foolishness is asserted rather than dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stitched map is dispatched, foreclosing the embroiderer’s direct intervention and leaving her in “earned stasis” beside the dying ember. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat thickens pattern until the final cadence shift. One minor causality wobble: the courier’s ignorance is told, not shown, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, brass domes, and eternal candle function as micro-setting that constrains choice (heat from the candle guides stitching rhythm). Sensory selection is biased to the protagonist’s tactile priorities; however, spatial anchors (“perched on the cliffs”) arrive late, slightly delaying orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“catch the murmurs that power tried to drown”—is signaled early and tightens through pattern-recognition beats. The decisive intensification occurs when the flame’s flicker syncs with the rustle of leaves, translating covert intel into embroidery. Cost is felt in the ember’s dimming, though the courier’s departure externalizes the final risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth hides in the interstices, and listening is resistance. The final image of the stitched sky reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. One near-miss: the phrase “truth could be sewn” flirts with thematic echo, but the earned image rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure (“threads crossing like conspiratorial lines on a map”). Perceptual signature is consistent—selective attention to heat, rustle, and light. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“loom of light,” “bruised sky”). One scaffold loop—“she felt… she whispered… she adjusted”—slightly dulls momentum mid-scene. Otherwise, zero mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of embroidery, astronomy, and espionage feels inevitable and fresh; the eternal candle as archive of untold stories is a non-obvious conceit that charges every beat. Risky lyric compression is fully integrated, not gimmicky.</comment>
