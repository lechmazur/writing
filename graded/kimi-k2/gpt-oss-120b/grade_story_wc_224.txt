<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her childhood courtyard shattering under memory’s weight is embodied and specific—but the buried-talent thread is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat, blunting the cost of her choice to seed new stories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira renounces the stone’s nightly substitution and claims agency to seed stories, with the mountain’s breathing ribs as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat thickens the map-of-feeling motif until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but breathing constraint; its corridors narrow choice and the mercury-glass book literally reflects Lira’s visage, charging the final image. Sensory specificity (pine resin, vellum pulse) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens when the stone’s corridor appears; the final reconfiguration forecloses reliance on nightly substitution. Cost is legible in the mountain’s slowing heartbeat and Lira’s acceptance of daylight silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as resonance rather than location. The obsidian-to-feather motif reweights from map to method without moralizing; the final image of daylight melody invites reflection without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature (liquid-metal eyes, feather-tip reading) stays consistent. Compression and patterned elision (“hidden thunder”) are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. Minor loop risk in “hidden thunder” repetition is offset by rhythmic variation. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cathedral-mountain, mercury-seer, and obsidian stone into a singular vision; the feather-as-reading-tool feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
