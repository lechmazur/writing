<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arin’s luminous skepticism is signaled but never tested; he tastes the wind and records data, yet no contradictory impulse or visible cost alters his stance. Interiority is poetic but generic, lacking idiosyncratic texture. The final “strange kinship” is asserted rather than dramatized, so the arc feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Arin’s realization that his own aura is weather—but the cost is soft, more mood than forfeiture. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of tasting and mapping thickens until meaning crystallizes. Orientation is clear early; no causal reversals, yet the lattice of observation tightens stakes under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lavender bluff and aurora are vivid, selective, and tethered to the compass’s mineral-sky logic. The scent shifts from sweet to sour, guiding the compass; microclimate nudges from tree-spores pressure choices. Final image of “scent a lingering code” recharges the setting as active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode why people carry weather—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through taste-cascade and compass flickers, but agency remains observational; no decisive trade-off or visible price is paid. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of attunement to planetary mood emerges implicitly through sensory patterning rather than statement. Final image reweights premise: technology and forest rites co-evolve. Avoids moralizing, but the conceptual cost remains gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific—“tasting the wind,” “circuits pulsed in sync with his breath.” Syntax mirrors auroral shimmer; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful and paid off in closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; metaphoric layering supports atmosphere without clogging beats. Occasional soft repeats (“luminous skeptic,” “emergent compass”) are minor. Rhythm breathes with scene intensity; no loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of forest elections, taste-based cartography, and terrestrially-cosmic tech feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through sensory specificity. Risk in lyric worldbuilding heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
