<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s solemnity is shown through tactile detail (clutching the notebook), but interiority drifts toward generic “burning reverie.” The micro-choice to trade beach-debris messages is vivid and stakes-driven, yet the diary’s retrocognitive trap is accepted without visible struggle or contradiction. Closure earns a modest renunciation—broadcasting truth at personal risk—but the cost is asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon crystal’s data is broadcast, reweighting collective memory. Causal chain holds—letters → diary → parley → lagoon → transmission—though the retrocognitive rule is introduced late. Orientation is swift; the zeppelin and desert are anchored within 50 words. One minor causality hiccup: the diary’s “future memory” requirement is declared but never tested on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Brass zeppelin, humming hull, violet reflections on obsidian water—details are selective and sensorily balanced. The floating library constrains action (limited brass for lamp) and returns in the final glow, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (notebook, crystal) functions as extension of character attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate erased histories—is signaled early and tightened through each beat: parley, debris cipher, lagoon decryption. Pressure escalates via scarcity (only kelp and shells to bargain) and risk (submerged crystal). The final broadcast narrows options—Mara cannot remain neutral—yet the felt cost is more communal than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of suppressed memory emerges through concrete images: dunes humming like suppressed voices, crystal pulsing with light-testimony. Subtext runs in the sand-carvers’ fingertip tracing—silence becoming speech. Final image of violet panels reframes the zeppelin from archive to beacon without moralizing. One soft echo: “searing reverie” repeats without deepening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation (“brass hull humming like a distant prayer”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices through archival instinct (oilskin, chronometer). No head-hopping. Compression (“she realized the diary was retrocognitively trapped”) is efficient but edges toward summary under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer image and information (“violet reflections on the black water”). Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped”) momentarily lifts register but stays within Mara’s scholarly lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors. One scaffold phrase—“a searing reverie, a relentless heat”—could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes steampunk zeppelin, desert sand-carvers, and retrocognitive archive into a coherent mythic logic. The beach-debris cipher feels fresh and culturally specific. Transformation test passes: the story would collapse if any core element were swapped. Minor risk in retrocognitive rule is mostly earned by closure resonance.</comment>
