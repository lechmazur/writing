<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo’s stubborn curiosity and embodied ritual actions (whispering into the coin, pressing the key) give him texture, but interior contradiction is muted; the final smile feels slightly unearned because no genuine flaw or cost is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parchment confirms the whisper’s reach, reweighting the premise. Causal chain (coin → map → key → box) is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the storm’s cadence deepens rather than merely decorates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Steel labyrinth, storm-lit containers, and the vibrating key form a tactile micro-setting that constrains Milo’s path and charges the final chime. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers outlast shouts—tightens once when the radio repeats the phrase. Cost is conceptual (the city’s hidden dialogues re-stitched) but less viscerally felt than required for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication’s quiet currents versus brute force. The parchment’s shimmer reweights earlier motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is atmospheric, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors electric tang and rust. Compression is purposeful, though occasional elevated phrasing (“calculated spontaneity”) edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but stacked metaphors (“living vein,” “steel veins,” “moth’s wing”) risk overwriting in peak beats. No loops or scaffold, yet density occasionally blurs clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geomantic port lore, maintenance ritual, and electromagnetic myth. The whisper-carrying coin feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (storm as carrier) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
