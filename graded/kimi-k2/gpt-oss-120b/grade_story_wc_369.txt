<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority is vivid—his palm on the brass, the pulse matching his own sorrow—but the “trees witness” motive is asserted rather than embodied in choice; the final calm is felt yet not paid for by a visible renunciation or flaw confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grid’s silence and the oak’s rustle reweight the premise with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each unspooled filament is a cadence shift that deepens the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, cracked shutters, and moonlit stone are selective and purposeful; the oak’s roots intertwined with stone constrain Eli’s path and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the sextant on the slab) functions as setting-object that guides choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—relieving the maze’s quantified sorrow—is signaled early and tightened once when each dream-line drawn dims the grid. Cost is visible: the sextant’s waning light and Eli’s ebbing stamina. Agency drives the escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief into measurable peace emerges through action and image, not statement. Final oak-rustle reprises the “trees witness” question with quiet resonance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through Eli’s patient craft. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under storm wind, longer breaths under moonlight. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but occasional stacked metaphors (“lattice of sorrow,” “mundane miracle”) risk overwriting in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; rhythm serves mood. One mixed metaphor—“filament… merging with moonbeam”—slightly blurs physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-transmutation arc is refreshed by the quantified-sorrow grid and dream-mapping sextant. Specificity of the oak’s centuries-long listening gives the premise bite. Risk is moderate; payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
