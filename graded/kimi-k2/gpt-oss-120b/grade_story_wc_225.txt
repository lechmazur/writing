<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"fierce repose" and embodied fidgeting anchor the tutor’s contradiction—but the forgiveness arc leans on summary near the end rather than a final embodied cost, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pawn dissolves, labyrinth softens, and time restarts—an earned stasis with visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each image reweights the prior. Minor ellipsis in how the tapestry code actually works keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selective and POV-filtered—wind that never moves, lightning frozen mid-flash—yet the platinum labyrinth and tapestry threads physically constrain entry and exit, charging the final image. A hair more tactile detail inside the maze would have nudged 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through each corridor turn; the pawn-sacrifice memory escalates regret until the final renunciation. Cost is legible but abstract; a sharper physical forfeiture would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as iterative openings emerges organically from chess metaphors and labyrinthine stripping. Final image of the banner “fluttering” reweights the initial frozen hush without moralizing—resonant reconfiguration achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, chess-laced diction (“knight’s L-shape corridors”)—and rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hops; perceptual signature remains coherent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“woven hush” returns transformed). One scaffold loop—“the lull that held time still” appears twice—minor, but keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess logic and mythic labyrinth; exile’s self-trial feels inevitable yet non-generic. Risky frozen-time conceit is fully committed to and pays off in the final thaw.</comment>
