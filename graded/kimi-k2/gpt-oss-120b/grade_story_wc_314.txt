<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selene’s interior contradiction—cold skepticism warring with hidden sentiment—drives every beat: thawing the crystal is a choice that exacts visible emotional cost, and her final spiral sealing earns renunciation with price. One significant tightening, stance earned, closure intact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arc follows flawless causal progression: dawn-harvest → starling-rhythm → thaw → shard spiral. Closure lands as Decisive Change: logic and intuition bridge made audible through amber hiss, cost clear. Lens holds to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Hidden orchard is not backdrop but crucible: waterfall-light fragments guide color choice in the climax, moss-stones constrain footing during ritual. Micro-setting with tangible resource: light shards, sound stones, visible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake (balance mind and heart) escalates under Causal lens: each beat tightens because starling flight narrows flame pulse, amber hiss raises visible price. One decisive intensification: shard spiral redefines stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ancient-freshness motif reframed by final amber sunrise—orchard breathes like a fulfilled promise, reconfiguring wonder as earned stasis. No tidy moral; ambiguity of eternal bloom vs mortal span lands with conceptual cost.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyrical voice—fresco “heartbeat of the orchard,” pronoun control clean, no filter-verb stacks. Compression and elision taught by midpoint (starling script) and paid off at closure under pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic, dense prose—noun-verb economy, no loops, onomatopoeic “amber hiss” hits climax with information density. Clear propulsion; minor pick-over of purple phrasing mid-story keeps it from 8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes classical alchemy iconography with starling flock as non-obvious pattern generator; fresco dialogue with contemporary emotional stakes feels fresh. Slight register drift in abstract “conceptual repricing” phrase withholds 8+ band entry tick.</comment>
