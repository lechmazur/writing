<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is character-specific and steady; once the “quiet surge, like embers sparking under ash” anchors the on-page calibration beat, the trait feels embodied. Cost is visible when leaving the farm with the laser in pocket, a tacit refusal to hoard control—Earned Stasis without exaggeration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated mappings of the laser across the membrane tighten the pattern until the farmland itself becomes “a living skin.” Closure appears in the final pocketed click—a Resonant Reconfiguration that concretely charges the mushroom-lit network.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The permeable greenhouse and bioluminescent caps physically constrain the intrusion-detection design; the laser’s beam slicing “through the soft fungus caps without damaging them” makes the environment co-author of the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—secure the farm from unseen intrusion—tightens as the storm test imperils water seepage; the permeable-barrier flex and laser mapping force immediate adaptation. Cost legibility felt in the post-dawn pocketed click’s forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Letting go” emerges from the pattern of releasing tension through membrane permeability and staff trust. Final image of the click-no-oppressor recodalizes “guard and guide” as the non-moralizing, earned answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent lyric compression; “bioluminescent mushroom farm, where caps pulsed like soft lanterns” teaches sensory shorthand early. Syntax modulates calm vs. micro-pressure without line artifacts; no head hops.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is selective—“quiet wildfire,” “ember spark”—and each metaphor services the stakes. Rhythm breathes through paragraph beats; no loops, zero filler, high information density intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Intrusion guard using a single laser pointer mapped across living fungi offers a fresh synthesis of tech and organism. The coupling feels inevitable; no derivative templates detected.</comment>
