<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse aligning with the press rhythm is embodied—but the borrowed-personality trait is asserted more than dramatized; no single poet’s cadence is shown altering a concrete choice. The final renunciation (to keep disorienting herself) is credible and carries felt cost, yet the prior beats do not stage contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the halo fragment cracks and releases a galaxy of empathy, reweighting the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each borrowed voice layers density until the pattern ruptures. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The topaz walls that “breathe like lungs” and the brass cradle actively constrain Mara’s movements and echo her internal state; the workshop’s violet pulse charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her artisan eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment’s crack forces Mara to accept endless disorientation as the price of knowledge. One clear deepening; cost is legible in the final cascade of light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: emotion as shifting function rather than fixed variable. The cracked halo’s release of “all the personalities she had ever held” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“inked plates beneath the trembling dome”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. POV remains tightly anchored to Mara; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“storm of thoughts…swirl a reminder”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the Accumulative lens. No loops or scaffold; final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of letterpress mechanics, borrowed poetic souls, and cosmic mathematics feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged closure image. No derivative templates detected.</comment>
