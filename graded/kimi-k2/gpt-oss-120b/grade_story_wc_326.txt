<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—her pulse against glass, the shard’s warmth—yet the “wisdom from failure” motive is asserted more than dramatized; the final smile feels slightly unearned because we never see her weigh an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: mis-typed death → ghost → ink ritual → restored pulse. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bureaucratic error is reframed as a mirror, costing Mara her prior certainty about system infallibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dome, ink bowl, and porcelain shard are tactile, bias-filtered, and directly constrain the defragment action; the midnight snow muffles external noise, isolating the heartbeat dialogue and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming legal existence—tightens when each ink sigil risks overwriting her mind; the ghost’s tally halts only after she accepts the flaw as teacher, a visible price paid in cognitive exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the ghost’s whispered confession: systemic error as human mirror. The porcelain shard’s reprise—cold to warm—reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving a resonant afterimage of fragility as strength.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, rhythmic, and POV-locked; sensory selection (“midnight snowfall,” “shimmering cascade”) feels like Mara’s trained astronomer’s eye. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“frozen lantern,” “crystalline whispers”) and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold: “soft hum…soft dialogue” echo, but it occurs early and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing quantum-server ghost with ink-based divination via porcelain acoustics feels fresh; the bureaucratic death-glitch trope is transformed through Mara’s embodied ritual rather than tech-exposition. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
