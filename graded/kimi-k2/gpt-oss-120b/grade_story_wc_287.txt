<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “protected vulnerability” is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (adjusting the latch, kneeling on the ledge). Motivation is consistent yet lacks a sharp internal contradiction that would force a costlier decision; the final renunciation is gentle rather than wrenching. The heirloom tool and ritual rose anchor her lineage of caretaking, but stakes never truly bite her personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “steady breath” replaces the earlier “quivering hush,” a visible shift in atmosphere that carries felt cost—Mara’s departure into further unknown tending. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each luminous vine adds density until the final image reweights the night. One minor drift: the rose-petal clock is named but never exerts causal pressure on timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The moonlit harbor is rendered with selective sensory precision—“silver ribbons dancing on the tide,” “oil lanterns sputtered”—and the fire-escape micro-setting constrains every physical move. The luminous vines evolve from setting detail to active agent, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the rosebush’s location remains slightly vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—banishing dread from the harbor’s corners—escalates through textured accumulation rather than sharp reversals. Each planted vine tightens the pattern until darkness “recoils,” a meaningful intensification under the Accumulative lens. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of caretaking-as-resistance emerges organically from action; no explicit moralizing. The final image of reflected light reweights earlier motifs without statement. Subtext in the heirloom tool whispers of inherited responsibility, but the thematic chord is single-note, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the “rhythm of oars.” Perceptual signature is distinct—Mara notices “gulls…feathers catching the faint gleam like tiny lanterns.” No POV drift; compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, each sentence advancing image or motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“silver ribbons,” “argent ribbon”) flirt with excess but stay legible. No loops or scaffold; minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) are voice-motivated and rare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The luminous-vine caretaker is fresh, synthesizing eco-fantasy with noir harbor mood. Familiar tropes—ritual rose, heirloom key—are transformed through tactile specificity. Risk is moderate; a bolder conceptual twist would lift it higher.</comment>
