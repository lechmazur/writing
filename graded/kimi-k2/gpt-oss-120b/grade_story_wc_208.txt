<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—salt-pine scent, scar-chapters—but her “perpetually learning” trait is asserted rather than tested; no contradictory impulse is dramatized. The final tableau choice is motivated, yet the cost feels abstract. Secondary characters are absent, so relationship crucible is N/A. Overall, strong embodiment with minor motivation gap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arch becomes living studio, child-self image reweights craft. Causal chain (GPS fails → lantern use → tableau decision) holds; storm-softening coincidence is atmospheric, not resolving. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. One transition (storm → workshop) is legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storm-arch breathes like driftwood grain—setting constrains final sculpture placement and mirrors internal shift. Turbine-hum threads through every beat, binding soundscape to heartbeat. Selective sensory hierarchy (salt, pine, brass) keeps economy tight. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: turn raw storm-arch into vessel for communal memory. Escalation is accretive: each lantern projection tightens the weave until tableau choice forecloses solitary sculpture path. Cost is conceptual—shared stories over lone authorship—but could be more viscerally felt. Agency remains Mira’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of learning-as-bridge emerges through lantern’s rope-visions and driftwood chorus; no explicit moralizing. Final child-self image reweights earlier “scaffold complexity with simplicity” without stating it. Subtext in turbine-lullaby and stone-breath deepens resonance. Complexity embraced; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric compression taught early (“weathered throat”) and sustained; turbine-hum motif modulates with pressure. POV remains tight third-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—sculptor’s tactile bias, salt-pine synesthesia—distinct and consistent. No register drift; metaphorical logic coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density: “storm-tossed archway loomed like a weathered throat” does triple duty. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no loops or scaffold. Occasional stacked modifiers (“turbine-hum reverie”) verge on excess but pattern-taught. Final image crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Driftwood sculptor + magic lantern + timewoven alliances feels fresh synthesis, not checklist. Transformation test passes: core arc inseparable from craft. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off; no close echoes. Specificity of “brass case” and “rope-threads” anchors novelty.</comment>
