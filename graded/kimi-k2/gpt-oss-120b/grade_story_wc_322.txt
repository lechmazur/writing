<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“unsettlingly calm,” “texture of connection”), but the architect’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice visibly forecloses a path. The final smile is earned, yet the cost is only implied, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weaving beat deepens pattern until the bridge crystallizes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—gallery dissolves into living tapestry—felt cost is the irreversible shift from observer to weaver. Orientation anchors early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gallery’s liquid-glass walls and breathing corridors are specific, sensory, and constrain movement; the sinew thread itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final bridge. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“texture of connection”—is signaled early and escalates through each eruption; the final bridge forecloses passive observation. Pressure tightens once, visibly, when the thread tightens and the courtyard appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection as both material and imagined emerges organically from the weaving action; final image of golden rain reweights prior illusions without moralizing. Subtext resides in pulse and filament rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“liquid glass,” “rational enchantment”) that modulates under pressure. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent and architect-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction fits the fever-dream register. Final cadence breathes with the collective sigh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses scientific and magical in a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the “rational enchantment” trope is transformed through tactile weaving. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
