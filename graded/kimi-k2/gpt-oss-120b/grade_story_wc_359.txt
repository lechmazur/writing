<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bell ringer embodies wonder but the “to certify wonder as essential” mandate is told not earned; interiority is lush yet choices remain abstract. Her synesthetic gift operates more as poetic filter than costly constraint; no concrete trade-off visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurora-tinted causality loops work under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each prism-song beat layers saturation until the final note seals a Resonant Reconfiguration. The scene never disorientates—cavern, bell, synesthesia form a taught synesthetic pattern that converges in the lingering aurora-hushed silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument—each aurora pulse in the fissures responds to tonal chords that paint stone, constraining what the bell can evoke. Spatial choreography remains locked: walls, fracture, aurora, listener’s body track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake–certifying wonder–escalates through color-saturation density: each echo demands more luminous breath from the singer. Cost registers as audible diminishment of her stamina in “each toll a prism…split into rainbow chords,” yet the price remains poetic more than corporeal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges aurora-like from the very physics of color-sound exchange, not sermon. Final image—the cavern “a living archive of wonder”—offers a Conceptual Repricing where silence itself becomes the sustained artifact, but a last-line abstract paraphrase nearly caps it at ~8.7.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct, synesthetically tuned perceptual signature never falters; clauses bloom and collapse like chords—e.g., “each crack reflecting…slow, breathing bands.” Rhythm modulates breath-by-breath under pressure; no POV leakage, no generic therapy voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry triple duty—image, cadence, pressure—without scaffold. Occasional pleonasm (“luminous chords”; “oscillating repose”) grazes purple but never distorts clarity. No loops, no mixed metaphors; closure line “waiting for the next chisel to strike marble” lands like a clean bell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic aurora-bell matrix is vivid fusion rather than gimmick; no derivative fantasy scaffold. Prism-echo archive is a fresh, inevitable compression. Final risk—conceptual more than action-driven—lands with legible pressure, avoiding abstraction collapse.</comment>
