<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lian’s interiority is textured through sensory embodiment (“heart beat in cadence,” breath merging with shadows) and a consistent arc from passive curiosity to active listener. Motives—honor lineage yet renounce tyranny—remain legible and escalate to the final extraction of scroll; cost sits in the confession he now must carry. Micro-choice to lift oak slab under rhythm guidance feels earned against prior pressure. Minor slip: “dynasty ender” badge is asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure occurs on page: decisive act of lifting floorboard yields scroll whose content reweights prior assumption of war-based fall. Cost is visceral—Lian inherits complicity and burden of silence transformed into new eloquence. Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of waves → map → carved panel → scroll accumulates density toward final Repricing. Orientation crisp within first lines; no causality drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is character; dust-kissed tomes, brass gramophone, cracked shutters all exert tactile pressure on choices—objects handled, crank turned, panel listened to. Environmental details (amber light, jasmine scent) evolve with beats, supporting rather than decorating. Micro-setting constraint of floorboards explicitly guides final discovery. Zero float; consistent spatial anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth retrieval versus risk of shame—signaled early and tightened through audible pattern search; one deepening beat at floorboard lifts and closure. Escalation flows under Accumulative pattern: each vibration layer reweights knowledge cost until scroll is inevitable. No coincidence resolution; protagonist agency drives every step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of legacy re-imagined through listening emerges from concrete beats (gramophone, wood grain confession) rather than declarations. Final realization—that dynastic end is renewal rather than ruin—reconfigures premise without sermonizing; ambiguity of future scholars feels organic. Scroll content provides ethical tension without tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate perspective holds steady; sensory filter is consistent sepia of study (amber, dust, ribbon light). Rhythm mimics phonograph cadence, breath pauses, micro compression under pressure. No POV leakage or register lift. Diction richly tactile yet coherent with scholar’s lexicon (“vibration dancing like ribbons”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is luminous, propulsive, varied sentence length under music. Zero loop or synonym stall; each phrase advances image or pressure. Occasional ornate phrasing (“eloquently silent”) repeated deliberately to thematic purpose. No clarity break at closure; diction supports intensifying beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh take on archival silence—sound as map, failure as seed—avoids standard “scholar uncovers dusty secret” template. Specific object logic (gramophone standing waves) and micro choice (listening to wood grain) feel invented rather than borrowed. Minimal risk deduction; combination remains legible and earned.</comment>
