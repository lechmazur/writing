<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning to map dreams yet fearing the burden—surface in micro-choices like pressing the film to stone. The lineage pressure is palpable, but the “shared responsibility” epiphany feels slightly over-articulated rather than dramatized. Still, her final acceptance carries visible cost: the ash-warm weight against her spine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the walls’ dream-hum becomes a living lullaby, reweighting the premise from solitary burden to communal communion. Causality holds—each diary fragment and film touch tightens the spiral toward this charged poise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and cadence shift at the end is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ivy-veiled passage is rendered with tactile specificity—stone hearth, curled diary leaves, film emulsion marred by ash—each detail filtering through Lira’s perceptual bias. Environment constrains choice: the corridor’s narrowness forces intimate contact with the wall, enabling the dream transfer. Weather (perpetual rain) seeps into every sensory layer, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover what walls dream—escalates through each film-guided probe; pressure tightens when the corridor exhales thunder, forcing Lira to decide whether to keep the dream private or share it. Agency is renunciation: she accepts communal stewardship, paying with the personal weight of history. Cost is felt in the ash-warm spine.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living tissue, legacy as shared stewardship. Subtext operates in the silent hum and the ash-scented weight—no moralizing. Final image of scholars leaving tokens reconfigures the premise without a stated lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s senses; diction is lyrical yet precise—“ghostly silhouettes,” “sigh trapped in stone.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at the climax. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats, accelerating during the thunder-hum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work. Occasional poetic stacking (“storm-filled visions,” “rain-kissed lullabies”) skirts overwriting but stays within pattern. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—echo cartography as archaeology of dreams—is fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of haunted corridors and inherited duty are transformed through light-sensitive film and communal stewardship. Final reconfiguration feels earned, not gimmicked.</comment>
