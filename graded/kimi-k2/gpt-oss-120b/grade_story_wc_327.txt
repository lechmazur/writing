<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“copper veins in his skin tingled”), motives intensify under pressure, and the final renunciation—sealing the language inside the canyon—carries visible cost. The contradiction between preserving and imprisoning the tongue is dramatized, not stated. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of birds → diamond → echo tunnel tightens until the final Charged Poise where the canyon “seals the newly forged language within its bone walls.” Orientation is immediate; closure lands with felt cost—the language is now inaccessible to the living.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the bone towers and echo canyon constrain every tactic and are re-charged in the final image. Micro-setting (flawed diamond) also constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save a dying language—tightens once when the storyteller realizes the price is eternal silence for the living. Escalation is driven by his agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the texture-to-sound translation and the paradox of preservation through burial. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the song survives only as sealed echo. Ambiguity lingers—gift or curse—earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent; perceptual signature (“quietly articulate”) modulates under pressure. Patterned elision (e.g., “texture into sound”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so mechanics waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful, never ornamental. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with stakes. Occasional elevated diction remains within the storyteller’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—translating stone texture into song via bird flight and cursed diamond—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (sealing the language forever) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
