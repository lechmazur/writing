<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority vivid—silver pulses, skin ripple-marked—yet motive “find the quiet in the storm” stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized between his need for calm and any fear or cost of using the stone. Emotions remain embodied, but the choice to conjure feels inevitable, not fraught. The final smile and whispered promise register as earned stasis with cost only implicitly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: echoes layer, cracks sing, ice melts into literal silence—final image of “hammered repose” provides Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (caves quiet, beings fade, mapkeeper assumes eternal vigil). Orientation anchor appears in sentence two, causality holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sapphire-lit tunnel and basso humming chamber function as living instruments; the echo chamber stone is both prop and pacemaker, its muted resonance constraining the mapkeeper’s placement. Spatial choreography is flawless; “spine-like fissure” gives tactile access. Final image of stone aligning with the cavern’s “spine” charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of cavern calm—signaled early and escalates through amplified auroras, then one clear tightening as the stone is set. Escalation is purely reactive; protagonistic agency is mostly receptive, not a trade-off that narrows other viable paths. Cost arrives as aftermath rather than decision consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of balance between echo and silence emerges organically through images of resonant caves vs. luminous stillness. Subtext lives in the ice fractures that “sang a low chord”—music as map. Final phrase guards eternal hush without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Luminous prose modulates with the cave’s sonic pressure: long cadenced sentences swell, shorter declarative bursts settle. Perceptual signature is consistent—aurora metaphors, ripple-etched memory, hammered repose—held in tight POV with no drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with the cavern soundscape; sentences expand and contract without filler. Occasional stacked modifiers “gently luminous glow that spread like a calm tide” verge on lush but pay off in closure imagery. No redundancies, zero filter stacks.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The “bloom of hush” reframes an SF trope of resonance-control device into lyrical conservation biology for energy beings. Details—ice sheet as musical grid, ripple-mark skin as living archive—are specific, not generic. However, the central device is conceptually familiar, limiting peak freshness.</comment>
