<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena is internally consistent and the loss-of-smell condition re-weights every beat, yet her final decision—“You are more than metal”—leans poetic summary rather than earned act; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in the final choice itself. The embodiment of grief and reverence is vivid but the cost is lightly sketched, keeping her arc from 9-band territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A clear Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the repaired clamp and rising water re-weight meaning. Anchoring is smooth by 120 words yet the ending’s cost is felt more conceptually (“shop’s gratitude”) than physically, capping it short of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fog, brass gears, and water-clock pulses are used sparingly to constrain time and visibility; the micro-setting of bench screw and cradle directly alters the final action. Specificity remains high and environment does subtly mirror psyche, so 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—reviving meaning from orphaned medical fragments—is signaled early; pressure coheres around Lena needing to “listen” through touch. There is no explicit tightening beat, rather a gentle rise, but the emotional cost lands visibly in the lullaby-like tick and water swell. Enough for high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of overlooked miracles gathers organically through tools, fog, and touch; it avoids abstract sermon. The conceptual repricing in the last paragraph carries subtle moral heft without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Free-indirect POV stays tight; sensory deprivation colors every perception with synesthetic workaround (“memory of breath”). Occasional grand cadences risk overt lyricism but remain within tolerated compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; mixed metaphors are minor and never stall clarity. Rhythm modulates from measured stillness to sunrise glint—“water glimmering like a quiet tear”—without redundancy. No line-level artifacts near closure keep the grade high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Anosmic aromatherapist repairing obstetric artifacts is a fresh angle; the transformation of midwife clamp into emotional compass is unforeseen yet inevitable in hindsight. While not radically innovative, the synthesis feels organically grown from persona and setting.</comment>
