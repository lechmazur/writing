<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is embodied and specific—"comforting unease that settled like a soft blanket"—but the “sound of trust breaking” motivation is asserted rather than dramatized; the final choice (watch on table) is a gesture, not a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sunrise ends the truce, the watch ticks out the night, and Lila walks toward “new false starts.” Causal chain holds (decoy barrel → darkness → lanterns saved), but the cost is diffuse rather than sharply felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rotting-pier market is vivid—salt, ferment, driftwood stalls—and the lantern-storage alcove constrains the final scramble; the antique watch serves as micro-setting that charges the last image. Spatial choreography is clean, but some sensory detail drifts toward the generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keep truce until sunrise) is signaled early and tightened by the lantern heist attempt; Lila’s agency drives the decoy and blackout. Cost is present (truce momentarily broken, darkness imposed) yet not viscerally personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust emerges through action (lantern theft, decoy, blackout) rather than statement; the final image of “new false starts” offers resonant ambiguity. No overt moralizing, though the “sound of trust breaking” motif edges toward label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent—"ferment," "tides," "brittle note"—with controlled lyric compression. No dialogue, but perceptual signature is strong; minor register drift (“conceptual repricing” diction) is absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is selective. One paraphrase loop (“comforting unease settled… again”) and a few stacked modifiers (“aromatic vapor, confusing the guards”) slightly dull peak beats, but clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Pirate-market truce with moonshine runner’s daughter feels fresh; the lantern-heist-as-trust-test is a non-obvious angle. Tropes (pier market, rival crews) are grounded in sensory detail, though the overall arc stays within recognizable noir-fantasy bounds.</comment>
