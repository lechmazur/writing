<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pruner’s reverence and creative hunger are palpable, but choices remain largely ceremonial; the vow and planting are acts of faith rather than tested decisions with visible cost. Interiority is lyrical yet abstract, lacking embodied contradiction under pressure. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard becomes a living chorus and the traveler leaves with a sprig—an earned stasis that forecloses the pruner’s solitude. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; each sunrise/twilight capture deepens the tapestry. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The verdant parapet, waterfall mist, and moonlit pool are vivid, selective, and tightly woven into ritual action. The setting constrains the pruner’s method—he must work at dawn and dusk—and charges the final image of intertwined worlds. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the seed cracks and luminous spores stitch bridges. Escalation is gradual, lyrical, and driven by the pruner’s tending; cost is conceptual (loss of isolation) rather than visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of wonder’s persistence emerges through concrete particulars: the glowing spores, the orchard’s chorus, the traveler’s sprig. No moralizing; final image of “hope blossoming anew” reweights earlier material without statement. Subtext operates in silence and light rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature is the pruner’s synesthetic awe (“liquid amber,” “waterfall’s misty sigh”). No dialogue; POV remains stable. Occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated and pattern-taught early. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense; figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacked (“radiant hush” repeated). No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene needs. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“color of wonder” refrain) but clarity intact. Strong sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Familiar orchard/seed trope is transformed through synesthetic ritual and inter-world weaving. Specificity of dawn-dusk capture and spore bridges feels fresh. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off in final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
