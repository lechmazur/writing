<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The historian’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of rhythm is embodied in each footfall, and the final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost. Motivation (“forbidden knowledge”) is constant, but the contradictory pull between nostalgia and purification is dramatized rather than stated. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he realized purification was not…”) that slightly blunts the embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian’s deliberate missteps open the archive and reconfigure his stance toward the past. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern-break and cadence shift reweight the stake with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The final image (“vanished into the twilight”) crystallizes options without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The archive’s breathing walls and bronze prism constrain every step; the shifting light literally dictates the historian’s irregular gait. Sensory detail is selective—scent of parchment, hum of bronze—filtered through the POV’s urgency. The prism’s reprise at the end recharges the opening image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlock forbidden knowledge—tightens once: the historian must abandon rhythmic certainty to reach the prism. The cost is visceral (anguished joy, tears) and alters his future path. Escalation is driven by his agency under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the historian’s embodied struggle: purification through fragmentation, not erasure. The “atoms of nostalgia” reweight from abstract yearning to living pulse inside him. No moralizing; the final image offers a non-literal answer—random steps as cosmic dance—without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax mirrors the historian’s erratic cadence (“each footfall echoed differently”). Perceptual signature is consistent—selective attention to light, scent, sound. No POV drift; purposeful compression (“pages long sealed fluttered open”) keeps momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“liquid memory,” “bronze ribs”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing” zone) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of archive lore, anti-pattern locomotion, and nostalgia-as-atom feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: swapping any element would collapse the logic—e.g., regular steps would break the prism’s mechanism.</comment>
