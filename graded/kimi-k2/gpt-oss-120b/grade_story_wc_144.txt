<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “tracing the edge of the now-perfect wing” shows tactile memory guiding choice. Blindness is not a label but a lived constraint that shapes every micro-decision; the water-refraction method is credible and costly. The final renunciation—turning back to the bench—earns its quiet cost because the prior beats have shown what she forfeits by staying. Only the colleague’s entrance feels ornamental, preventing a 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the hummingbird’s successful hover crystallizes Mara’s stance—she will keep mending while the ship sails. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of light, mist, and vibration layers until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact; every beat flows from “torn membrane → water test → patch → hover.” No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The depot’s mist is not backdrop; its droplets refract lantern light into a measuring tool that literally guides the repair. The hummingbird’s wing and the water basin function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound and vibration dominate because Mara cannot see. Only the ship remains slightly postcard-distant, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake: can Mara mend the drone before the ship departs? Pressure tightens once—the tear threatens flight, the patch must hold under stress. Agency is hers; the water-refraction test is a deliberate tactic with visible cost (time, precision). The anchor’s final clang externalizes the irreversible departure, foreclosing the option to follow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: repair as an act of faith in futures one will never witness. The hummingbird’s mended wing becomes a quiet metaphor for invisible labor that enables grand departures. No moralizing; the final image of Mara turning back to the bench lets the reader feel the cost of staying. Subtext is carried in gesture and light, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, synesthetic, and consistent: “magnetic calm,” “soft sigh of polymer,” “whisper in sync with distant clatter.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during the patch. No POV leakage; every perception is filtered through Mara’s heightened non-visual senses. Dialogue is minimal and natural, serving only to re-anchor the ongoing work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers sensory data without clutter. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“mist-coated rail depot hummed” sets tone without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; information is delivered through action. Only a single near-repeat (“magnetic calm” used twice) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>The synthesis of blind artisan + drone repair + water-refraction measurement feels fresh and inevitable. The premise transforms the familiar “maker” trope by centering non-visual perception as the critical tool. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-confrontational closure, yet it lands with felt cost. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
