<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s reverse-aging curse and her wish to turn it into a gift are stated early and color every beat; the final renunciation—choosing to teach rather than grasp eternal youth—carries visible cost. Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstract self-diagnosis (“reverse aging could become a gift rather than a curse”). Embodied emotion is strongest when she feels the magnetic pull “like sycamore breath,” grounding her paradoxical patience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the grotto’s mirror reveals that mastery is not eternal youth but the art of appearing while vanishing, a delayed revelation Mira has literally enacted by withholding sight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple, ring, and magnetic thrum layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in her smile and the platform’s gentle lift—she forfeits immediate self-cure to become teacher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The floating rock, obsidian cliff, and iron-veined grotto are rendered with selective sensory precision; the platform’s sway and the ozone scent constrain Mira’s trance and later steps. Micro-setting—the pond’s rings—functions as map and oracle, directly shaping her path. One slip: “sycamore hush” is repeated without fresh charge, a minor texture drag.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—learn to teach vanishing to appear—tightens once: Mira must withhold perception until the grotto grants its lesson. The single meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses to delay sight, narrowing her options to either grasp youth or accept the paradox. Cost is felt in the final renunciation, though the escalation beat could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the paradox that one must vanish (withhold sight) to truly appear. The delayed revelation motif threads through ripples, rings, and mirror without overt statement. Final image—Mira stepping back onto the platform to teach—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to her quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Mira’s patient, paradox-tuned perception; diction like “sycamore breath” and “magnetic grotto hush” is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with trance and tension. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; single POV remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and purposeful, rarely overwrought. Occasional soft filler—“quiet resolve,” “deliberate calm”—could be trimmed. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats; final paragraph crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The reverse-aging curse, magnetic grotto, and ripple-divination synthesize into a fresh meditation on time and self-erasure. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight, not derivative.</comment>
