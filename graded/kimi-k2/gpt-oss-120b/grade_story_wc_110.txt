<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrical but diffuse; her “ledger” and “origami thoughts” gesture at occupation without ever constraining choice. The final smile is the only embodied cost, and it feels under-earned because her agency is mostly interpretive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s “collective sigh” reframes mistrust into transparency. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lens, doodles, and rain build density until the forecourt itself speaks. Cost is diffuse—light fading, faces in puddles—but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The rain-slick forecourt, projector lens, and velvet-dust theater are vivid and selective. The crystal surface literally becomes the final canvas, constraining how truth is displayed and charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing collective mistrust—intensifies as each decoded doodle adds pressure. The single tightening is the moment the lens amplifies “the trembling honesty of the walls,” a beat that narrows options from private decoding to public confession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as liberation emerges through image rather than statement; the forecourt’s glowing confessions avoid moralizing. The final “resonant hush” offers a non-literal answer: truth need not be spoken to be shared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature leans toward synesthetic metaphor (“ink humming with residual light”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final projection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical but occasionally overwritten (“words after words become unnecessary”). No loops or scaffold, and rhythm modulates with pressure. Metaphors stay coherent, though density flirts with purple in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a city learning to speak through light and puddles feels fresh; familiar motifs (abandoned theater, cryptic sketches) are transformed by the lens-as-microphone inversion. Specificity grounds the magic.</comment>
