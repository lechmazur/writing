<comment>Lira’s interior contradiction – skepticism mixed with yearning for the seashell’s song – is vivid, embodied, and grows under pressure; the renunciation (accepting solitude as its own lighthouse) is earned. Yet the “archive of quarantined memory” remains an abstract label; no contradiction within that concept is dramatized in-scene, blunting flaw and cost specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The story’s closure – the symbolic merge of shell-light and sunrise – is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible as the loss of the shell’s voice. Orientation and causality hold, but at 800 words the beat pattern leans summary and circular description three times, softening the decisive tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The velvet garden, dawn violet, and roses-as-pale-hands ground every move; the garden itself constrains Lira’s arc by offering silence and then light. Sensory specificity is high, but two brief spatial drift phrases (“draped in deep violet velvet” repeated cadence) keep it just under a 9-band touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—solitude re-forged into independence—is announced early and escalates via each resonance-structure recording in the ledger; a single meaningful turn occurs when silence must be surrendered to sunrise. Cost is felt, though largely abstract: the price (losing the singing seashell) sits on the threshold between physical and symbolic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges elegantly from material rather than statement: isolation transmuted into self-sustaining light plays out through the shell’s voice, the garden’s breath, the ledger ink. A slight pulse of thematic echo in the final paragraph (“archive of her quarantined memory burst into visible chords”) trims half a point from perfect 8.5 clarity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression and recurring motifs are taught early; free-indirect interiority stays consistent. Syntax sometimes lapses into patterned cadence (“resonance structure latticed… catalogued… forged”), flattening voice under peak pressure. Still perceptually distinct and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; every image advances atmosphere or emotion. A minority of lines drench in ornate metaphor (“tragically radiant glow, as if the broken piece itself mourned”) and one paraphrase loop sneaks in. Nothing clogs closure clarity, but the slight oversaturation edges the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pandemic isolation recontextualized via alchemical botanical twilight, resonance-structure philology, seashell phonics. Derivative markers are avoided; even the lighthouse metaphor evolves from literal garden starlight. Risk-taking is coherent and tied to closure.</question>
