<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara registers through curated isolation and bodily awareness—her deliberate estrangement compels higher-stakes choices as each call layers Lena’s grief onto the disc—yet the interiority dips into abstract reflection (“she had come to understand”) rather than on-the-body contradiction just before the pivot, dulling the hinge of earned renunciation. Still, the embodied pulse of the tunnel, glass, and disc sustains her as a lone, consistent presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The closure is an earned resignation: Mara leaves the booth and the concrete “pulse[s] with the same rhythm she had been trying to teach,” a Charged Poise reconfiguring estrangement into communion under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is visible but slightly softened by the poetic summation that compresses the final action, keeping it just below the 8 threshold for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted utilities and filtered streetlamp shivers tether Mara at every sensory register, while the glass harmonica disc not only decorates but reweights the final stance—exactly the kind of charged object-as-setting that tightens choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching endings to begin—is clear; pressure coils tighter with each recorded fragment until the last whispered “Thank you” crystallizes cost under Mara's agency. One coherent escalation is sufficient for this word count, though the legible price leans conceptual rather visceral, keeping it shy of the higher band edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The looped symphony of grief becomes the thematic engine; the idea that cessation is initiation pulses without sermon, carried by the final echo (“Thank you”) that reweights the entire subterranean design. No explicit moral, only resonance rising from concrete particulars.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The narration threads poetic cadence, selective metaphor, and tunnel acoustics into a single, sustained perceptual signature, never head-hopping. Lines like “the tunnel seemed to breathe a little softer” are voice-driven rather than ornamental, holding coherence under lyric pressure.</question>

<comment>The prose is melodic yet lean, each image doing relational work; only a few scaffold sentences (“she had come to understand…”) cushion the final descent. Minor compression keeps the rhythm clean without breaking causality.</question>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The subway booth-phonics-chorus premise is fresh, executed with specific sensory conviction rather than gimmick. The wrong-number friendship device serves as organic premise, not contrivance; the synthesis feels inevitable and stakes-sharpening.</question>
