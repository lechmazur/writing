<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The exile’s interiority (“felt hopeful melancholy swell”) is embodied and specific, the basalt stone’s micro-choices anchor emotional conflict, and the final renunciation—accepting lingering sorrow as compass—carries clear cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tutor re-weights the eclipsed covenant from broken oath to paused conversation, visibly adopting exile’s labor as reparative ritual. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; twilight pulses deepen texture until stone glows, tightening stakes without causal coils.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus “warmed in his palm as currents brushed his skin” constrains the final choice—alignment of pieces beneath eclipse edges—so environment becomes purposeful felt pressure, satisfying 9+ gate for micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake—“discover beauty hidden in difficulty”—is signaled early, intensifies through successive celestial-board translations, and crystallizes in a final stance that forecloses immediate reunion; felt cost is exile prolonged, yet escalation remains lyrical density more than causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively: boards as maps of existence, sacrifice re-interpreted as renewal. The closing image (“beauty would finally rise from the difficulty”) offers concrete thematic echo without moralizing; specificity and ambiguity coexist effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: “cloaked flutter like a wan flag,” “each throb a reminder”; contraction/expansion with emotional pressure keeps voice coherent; purposeful lyric elisions are taught early and paid off at stone’s final glow. No dialogue judged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences advance multiple duties (“he whispered to the stone, asking it to hold the weight… it responded with a faint hum”); minor loops occur but none obscure closure; few figurative muddles and rhythm remains supple under meloncholic swell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Combination of star-drawn chessboard, magnetized stone, and ex-derived pedagogy feels inevitable yet fresh; lyrical risk elevates stakes without gimmickry. Slight deduction for faint homage to quest-literature wandering, but specificity of board motifs defamiliarizes the frame.</comment>
