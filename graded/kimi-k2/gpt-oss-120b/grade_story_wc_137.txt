<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—logic vs wonder—is embodied in micro-choices (tea to the wind, precise notes) and culminates in the costly renunciation of pure skepticism when she whispers the promise. The trait “courageously kind” is dramatized through the act of offering sanctuary, but the emotional layering feels slightly smoothed rather than jagged under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower becomes a sanctuary, the tile settles into calm, and Lira’s stance crystallizes with the whispered promise—cost is the permanent openness she now must maintain. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of imagery and pattern intensify until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tower, tile, and migrating whales form a micro-setting that constrains choice: the tile’s glow and the whales’ timing dictate when transcription can occur. Sensory selection is biased through Lira’s skeptical yet yearning perception. Spatial choreography is coherent; the alcove, desk, and windows track cleanly. The final image of the tile glowing like a lighthouse charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—creating a reflective sanctuary—tightens once when the tile’s final square demands Lira’s permanent guardianship. Escalation is accumulative: each new line of verse increases the cost of openness. Agency is present in her decision to carve the alcove and whisper the promise; luck (whales’ arrival) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-migration emerges organically from whales, tile, and Lira’s transcription; no explicit moralizing. Subtext resides in the unheard symphony and the silent promise. The final image reweights the premise: sanctuary is not a place but an ongoing, costly listening. Complexity is honored—doubt and wonder remain entwined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, mirroring Lira’s skeptical precision. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—long, breathing sentences during wonder, clipped clauses during notation. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly filtered through Lira. Distinct perceptual signature: she “dares the darkness to answer” and “whispers apologies to the stars.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional stacked metaphors (“ribs of a whale’s heart”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. Rhythm accelerates during tile-shifts and slows at closure. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register drift—“conceptual symbols”—does not blur clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of magic square, whale migration, and skeptical stargazer feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure; it pays off in the final reconfiguration. No close echoes of famous scenes. The premise is familiar but transformed through Lira’s embodied doubt and the tile’s living numerology.</comment>
