<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical but generic; the “clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming” is asserted, not dramatized through contradiction or error. Her single decisive act—accepting the cave’s inhabitation—lacks prior causal pressure and visible cost, so the change feels gifted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (the cave inhabits Lira’s destiny), but the causal chain is diffuse: the pilgrim’s arrival triggers no irreversible choice; Lira merely witnesses. Orientation is clear early, yet the lens hovers between Situational and Accumulative without firm linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The musical crystal cave is vividly textured—quartz, opal, singing walls—and the overlapping shadows physically constrain movement and meaning. Setting actively amplifies the final image, charging the closure with harmonic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake (magnify everyday magic) is announced early but never tested under rising pressure; the pilgrim’s prayer is granted without trade-off or narrowing of options. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal, so cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of unseen possibility emerges through image and echo rather than statement, culminating in the child’s cascade of crystal droplets. The final reprise of “bright darkness” reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the insight feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyrical, with rhythmic control and selective sensory focus. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping. The pilgrim’s laugh and the child’s onyx eyes add distinct perceptual signatures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“ribbons of light…dust on parchment”) risk overwriting but do not obscure causality. Loops and scaffold are minimal; final cadence is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of crystal acoustics, living shadows, and clairvoyant blind-spot feels fresh, though the “cave chooses the seer” twist edges toward familiar numinous trope. Specificity of harmonic resonance and amber tear lifts it above template.</comment>
