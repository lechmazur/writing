<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s contradictory impulses (doubt vs resolve) are dramatized through tactile micro-choices with the charm and statue. The final renunciation of fear is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the acid-sea ceasefire. Voice occasionally drifts toward therapeutic abstraction (“even doubts could be forged into purpose”), but the embodied beats outweigh the lapses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the acid sea calms, the workshop pauses, and the charm becomes a bridge—cost is felt in the surrender of uncertainty. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; cadence shift from corrosive churn to lullaby reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis—how the charm physically seals the statue’s fissure—doesn’t derail legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is selective and sensory; the acid sky and gear-pulse constrain breathing and pacing, charging the final image. The statue’s pockmarks function as micro-setting that guides the quilting action. While the broader world rules remain sketchy, the immediate environment and tools shape every beat. Meets 9+ gate: the workshop’s pulse and acid mist directly alter tactics and the final lullaby.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory pressure (acid, ticking gears). One meaningful deepening: the alchemist’s surrender to narrative as repair forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the acid sea’s momentary ceasefire. Agency is narrative rather than physical, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of kintsugi-as-repair emerges organically from the alchemist’s tactile quilting of memories; no explicit moralizing. Final image—“each crack holds the promise of a golden line”—reweights prior voids without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in the warming charm and the statue’s liquid light. Avoids sentimentality through corrosive sensory counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through the alchemist’s salt-tarnished, gear-tuned awareness. Syntax modulates with stress—long breaths contract into clock-tick fragments. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Occasional elevated diction (“dire enchantment”) is consistent with the fabulist register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (“acid-etched horizon” returns as “acid-fumed sunrise”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“heart throbbed like a clock-gear”—is minor and doesn’t cloud closure. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s pulse.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Premise synthesizes kintsugi, floating workshop, and acid sea into a fresh, non-obvious whole. The quilting-of-memories mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss. Avoids stock steampunk or post-apocalyptic tropes through salt-tarnished specificity and embodied alchemy.</comment>
