<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Oracle's drive to map void powers the action, but his interiority hovers in lyrical evocation rather than embodied contradiction: “the ambered hush” loops without physical reaction beat. Cost is felt at closure when map dissolves into night itself, yet internal tension remains decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accretive-textural drive taught in opening; closure lands as RR—Charged Poise where the map becomes hush and breath is price. Lens consistent, tightening achieved via density gain rather than external opposition; causality intact with one visible cost at last exhale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ridge fort and pelting rain constrain light, movement, visibility; storm’s violence is tactile and specific, shaping silence as usable resource. Repeated “ambered hush” and “marbled hush” provide micro-setting texture that reweights finale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the night mapped out—stays singular and felt; escalation delivered by densifying hush and single star’s last wink. Agency is attention under erosion, narrowing to final crystallization; no off-screen luck, cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of silence, mapping void, listening-as-survival emerge wordlessly through pattern of retellings, light winks, page sighs. Repricing reframes listening as covenant—cost felt without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third-person interiority stays razor-focalized; syntax and diction echo a seer who compresses oceanic silence into metric phrases (“salt and ambered hush”). No head-hop; patterned cadence enacts obsession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking sonic texture without drift; minor loop echoes like “marbled hush” are deliberate atmospheric recurrences. Metaphors don’t collapse logic; sentences pull double weight, rhythm tightens at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography as mystic oracular breathing; tropes of storm, star, ancient maps are warped into tactile quiet ritual. Concept risks near-trope drift but escapes via sensory compression.</comment>
