<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is specific—chains as bodily pressure, a lullaby recalled only where it unlocks the piano puzzle, her contradictory impulses (caution vs. desperate urgency) manifest in micro-choice and embodied tension. The final renunciation—"chains now rusted loose"—is foreshadowed by every clink, each step earned through the seed-guardian ethos laid groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality is clean: the arrow's fireworks-stained fletching triggers the piano, the melody re-coded in Mara's memory grants descent, the seed vault opens under that key, the wall falls only after planting. One drift note: the carnival façade crumbles without causal cue, slightly softening the "because" line at the final click.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade> 
<comment>Concrete sensory immediacy—phosphorescent fungi pulse, iron door hum, arrow shaft vibrates—grounds the scene. Environment narrows choices: the decayed carnival funnels Mara forward while its derelict grandeur reflects the drought's scale. Micro-setting (piano bench, spiraling stair) constrains motion and charges final ascent.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (prevent famine) is anchored early and escalates by narrowing options until only the planted grain remains as hope. The cost—physical chains and spiritual exhaustion—is dramatized; failure risk is existential, success redefines her identity. One mild over-declaration: "plant resilience" stated more than once still lets escalation legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: reclamation of broken places, memory as key, seeds as memory reborn. The broken carnival wall becomes a literal wall coming down—visual closure reweighs metaphor without sermon. Subtext sits in the lullaby memory, the arrow's ash feathers, the jasmine breeze—all resonate without label.</comment>

<comment>Lyric, slightly elevated diction fits the twilight fable tone; no head-hopping; filtered perception of decay and hope. Sentence rhythms contract and expand under escalating hope ("She knelt…and smiled"). No register drift when piano keys are decoded; the mother's lullaby idiom remains authentic to internal voice.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Clean compression, no paraphrase loops; figurative language (vault as "forgotten throat") is precise and pays off. Prop movement tracked across sentences. One minor density bloom in the first paragraph ("rusted cathedral, broken mirrors reflecting," etc.), yet the momentum carries through without artifact drag at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Transforms drought-apocalypse premise via carnival archaeology; seeds as post-explosive fletching makes fresh linkage. Avoids common tropes by grounding solution in musical memory + physical seed. The only near-echo is the symbolic "wall" in legend, though its literal collapse recontextualizes genre familiarity.</question>
