<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selene’s precognitive curse and her desire to understand sacred patterns create a clear, embodied interior conflict; the shift from fearing the curse to using it as a compass is earned through the ritual and its cost. Micro-choices—placing each rock, kneeling, whispering—reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. The final smile and measured steps show a credible, costly renunciation of paralysis. Only the “eel herder” label remains ornamental; no eels or herding appear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the Fibonacci sequence of painted rocks gathers density until the violet flame reconfigures both tide and curse. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Selene’s stance crystallizes as she accepts perpetual, iterative labor. Cost is visible: the curse becomes lifelong compass, the flame departs downstream, and she steps forward knowing future loops remain. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, basalt, aurora, and salt-spray are vivid, selective, and filtered through Selene’s urgent priorities. The painted rocks function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual and charges the final image when they glow in perfect ratios. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment evolves with the tide’s pause and resumption, mirroring internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning curse into usable foresight—is signaled early. Escalation is a single, intensifying accumulation: each rock tightens the pattern until the violet flame seeds future bluffs. Cost is the perpetual burden of foresight and the flame’s departure. No coincidence resolves; all pressure arises from Selene’s deliberate design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: order wrested from cosmic chaos through intentional design. The Fibonacci spiral, star-dust memory, and borrowed dawn reweight each other without moralizing. Final image of glowing stones and whispering tide offers resonant, non-literal answer—patterns are coaxed, not fixed. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the ritual and breathes at the end. Perceptual signature is Selene’s: kelp-sheen skin, salt-smell, mathematical spirals. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (“borrowed dawn,” “collapsed star dust”) is taught early and paid off in the violet flame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“dust glittered like powdered iron,” “tide seemed to pause, listening”) is purposeful and pattern-taught. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize the Charged Poise without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of eel herder, star-dust, Fibonacci ritual, and post-friction world feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped. Fresh inflection: curse repurposed as iterative cartography.</comment>
