<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her hands “cradling an ash wood carving blank as if it were a newborn memory” shows contradiction between grief and creation. The micro-choice to seal sap with glass crystallizes her shift from mourning to stewardship, paying a felt cost (the softened roar). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Reflection stays within BRR limits and alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each kettle-boil cycle layers density until the final amber lantern reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara sets the lantern on the hearth, crystallizing options with visible cost (the vanished roar now a sigh). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The loft’s rain-beaded skylight and copper roofs are vivid, selective, and filter through Mara’s circus-trained eye. The ash wood blank and iron gouge function as micro-setting that constrains carving choices. Final lantern glow charges the image, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—turn loss into living tool—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: sap sealing crystallizes time, foreclosing raw grief. Cost is the softened roar, legible on page. Agency remains Mara’s; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful deepening meets scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-tool emerges from concrete acts, never stated. Final lantern image offers non-literal answer: loss can be shaped, not merely mourned. Subtext in steam “curling like the tail of a lion that had slipped away.” No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with circus-bred perceptual signature—“tamer’s whip” light on iron gouge. Rhythm modulates with kettle’s boil; no head-hopping. Compression taught early (“while the kettle boils”) and paid off at closure. Distinct texture sustains pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language serves pattern—steam as “silver veins,” sap as “translucent memory vault.” Final third clean; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Circus-widow wood-carver premise is fresh; crystallized-time sealing of grief via kettle steam is non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final lantern image. Specificity prevents trope drift; transformation test passed.</comment>
