<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority glows—her hush, meticulous gestures, and bodily wonder around buttons and sand read as singular—but near-closure voice drifts into gentle summary (“realized her motivation…”) just when final cost should sting hardest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure delivers an earned conceptual repricing: walking across the sand-bridge reconfigures the prophecy from jumble to open possibility. Causal chain from button-sorting to echo-burst is legible under an Accumulative lens; only minor ellipsis between jar activation and bridge forming keeps it shy 9.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Warehouse walls “breathe slow, amber glow” and the sealed sunrise on the jar texture both space and stakes. Environment doubles as tool—buttons as tesserae, grains as time—directly constrains arrangement tactic and charges final bridge image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to spin prophecy into raw possibility”—tightens when each catalogued button narrows and finally unlocks the canyon song. One clear inflection: layout of river-shaped buttons triggers irretrievable roar, with a felt price (Mara’s solitary walk on time-sand leaving familiar world behind).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of pooled, living memory emerges organically from grains, buttons, and echo. Final river-song re-codes prior motifs without moralizing; resonance rests in concrete act, not allegorical speech.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sensuous, tactile diction (“amber light swelled”, “thin bridge across the canyon’s chasm”) modulates rhythm with measured gravity. No filter clutter. Internal voice remains distinct; momentary editorial pulse in last paragraph remains recoverable.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences weave imagery and causal thrust cleanly; minimal scaffold. Rhythm flexes under tension. One faint over-modulation—repetitive “shared wisdom” phrases—but it never clouds sense.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing hourglass craft with collective-memory cosmology yields a synthesis that feels post-fairy-tale yet grounded in tactile artifacts. Stakes and motif knit so tightly that substitutions would crack the fabric. Minor loss of edge from late echo of lyric destiny tropes.</comment>
