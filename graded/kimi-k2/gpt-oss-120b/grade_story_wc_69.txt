<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The teacher’s interiority is vivid—her “expectantly resigned” stance threads through the scene—but her micro-choices remain largely observational; the decisive invitation to the child and veteran is under-motivated, arriving as grace rather than earned tactic. Embodied emotion (dust settling on tomes, shoulders loosening) is strong, yet the final renunciation lacks a palpable personal cost beyond hope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the library becomes a crucible, the rosette glows, and the town’s hatred is audibly rusting away—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each chord thickens the pattern until silence itself is re-weighted. One minor drift: the “weeks that followed” epilogue dilutes the single-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The velvet library is no backdrop; its acoustics, scent, and light actively shape the method—“subtracting noise” is materially enabled by velvet curtains and vaulted echoes. The zither rosette’s sunrise glimmer returns at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; only the exterior wind remains a generic flourish.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming vanishing songs to unlearn hatred—is signaled early and tightened through each chord; the townspeople’s loosening shoulders show visceral cost. Agency is mostly atmospheric rather than tactical; the teacher’s final invitation is a gentle widening, not a narrowing of options, so escalation feels more accretive than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: art’s survival through subtraction, harmony as anti-weapon. Subtext lives in gesture—the rosette glowing approval, the silence sharpened into canvas. Final image of children tracing the pattern offers a resonant, non-moral answer. One soft echo: “vanishing arts” is named more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with velvet-and-rain sensory signature and rhythmic control that modulates from hush to chorus. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to the teacher. Occasional elevated diction (“expectantly resigned,” “conceptual repricing”) feels earned by the choral register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical—sentences advance atmosphere and action simultaneously. A few near-loops (“each note denoted…”) are saved by variation. No mixed metaphors; figurative language stays coherent. Minor scaffold: “the world outside was losing its songs faster than any season could turn” could trim two words.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—using silence as compositional tool against communal hatred—is fresh and fully committed to. The zither-rosette as sunrise-captured melody is a specific, non-generic object. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than plot twist; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
