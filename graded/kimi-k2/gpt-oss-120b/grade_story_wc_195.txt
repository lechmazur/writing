<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The knight’s solitude and “murmured allegiance” are consistently dramatized through bodily micro-choices (hand on glyphs, armor melting into moss). The interior contradiction—yearning for possibility vs. fear of exposure—remains embodied. A clear renunciation occurs when the armor fuses away, but some inner beats still skew toward “philosophical summary” rather than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: the final moment crystallizes stance and reweights meaning (armor becomes soil, stage becomes living promise). Closure = Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise with on-page cost. Cause-and-effect feels porous, but the escalating image-density legitimately reconfigures stakes. A single meaningful tightening is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Specific, poetic greenhouse anchors (coppered vines, silver-moss floor) actively constraint the knight’s every move. The alchemical haze recharges the final image cost. Some spatial markers drift in the vapor passages, preventing top-band clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is early and clear. Escalation arrives as density tightening: every motif (moss, script, chorus) increases physical-ethical pressure until armor dissolves. One felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges via living theater metaphor: loyalty re-defined as song, not chain. No explicit moral; final kiss of frost re-writes allegiance as growth. Light thematic echo mid-closure but resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice stays lyric and controlled. Syntax modulates—long breath vs. urgent fragments—under vapor pressure. Metaphor threading (alchemy/ marionette) is taught early and recurs cleanly. No POV leakage or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and purposeful; nearly no loops. Minor overwritten lines near the frost-kiss cost a hair: “stitched the night into a tapestry” is one mixed thread shy of 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fuses greenhouse noir + puppet-theater mysticism into fresh alchemy. Knight-orchard symbiosis feels inevitable. Fresh angle but not unprecedented; transformative enough to satisfy. No gimmickry.</comment>
