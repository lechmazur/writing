<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“abrasive calm” as lived contradiction), but the final shift from agonizing to chorus-of-truths feels slightly under-cooked; the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in a single visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cog’s ticking reweights the premise, fusing rival histories into a shared pulse. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of sedimentary clues and brass rhythm tightening to final cadence. One transition (surface silence → sewer study) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bioluminescent algae, dripping arches, and brass teeth create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the scholar’s posture and tools; the sewer itself becomes the laboratory where past and present irrigations align. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to remember the waterworks—tightens once when the cog syncs with sedimentary layers, forcing the choice to preserve both narratives. Cost is conceptual: surrender of single-story certainty, felt in the final “common pulse.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as irrigation, competing stories as complementary verses. Final image of cog ticking with city’s rebirth offers non-literal answer—multiplicity as survival—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: erudite diction filtered through damp, metallic decay; rhythm modulates from languid reflection to clipped brass clicks. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern (sediment = memory, cog = pulse). One minor loop (“competing narratives” twice in two lines) but no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drowned-city philosopher uses sewer sediment as archive, brass cog as metronome for plural histories. Risky lyric-accumulative structure pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
