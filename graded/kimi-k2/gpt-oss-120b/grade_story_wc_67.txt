<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the protagonist’s contradictory impulses (to preserve yet release the emotion) play out in micro-choices—sprinkling powder, aligning mask shards, pressing palm to floor. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies toward the final crystallization. The mask’s removal and the porcelain snowfall form a credible renunciation with visible cost. Only slight reserve: the “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” label feels more epithet than lived identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each powder-sprinkle and shard-refraction thickens the gallery’s atmosphere until the crystalline lattice reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the lattice’s pulse makes the captured emotion undeniable and forecloses retrieval. Cost is legible in the final image: “the emotion forever etched in stone.” Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The vanishing-point gallery is not backdrop but active pressure: its converging walls and self-rocking chair constrain movement and attention. Micro-setting (floor cracks, dim light, rocking chair) is handled tactically—powder settles into cracks, shards refract light onto walls. Final lattice forms a charged micro-environment that crystallizes the emotion. Meets 9+ gate: setting constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—crystallize a fleeting emotion—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each powder layer and shard glimmer tightens the emotional vise until crystallization is irreversible. Agency is present in every deliberate sprinkle and whispered incantation. Cost is the irreversible loss of the emotion to stone; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the mirage of safety dissolves into the braver act of feeling. Subtext lives in gesture—mask lowered, porcelain snowfall, lattice pulse—never in statement. Final image reframes earlier “broken hopes” as necessary fragments for honest light. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers whether crystallization is triumph or elegy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through the scatterer’s tactile bias. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths during setup, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Purposeful elision (ritual mechanics, gallery origin) is taught early and paid off in the crystalline closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and action without redundancy. Metaphors (porcelain shards like broken hopes, powder like frozen breaths) are precise and non-contradictory. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates toward the final lattice. Minor elevated diction (“somber marvel”) fits the lyric register and is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—ritual crystallization of emotion via ash and porcelain in a vanishing-point gallery—is fresh synthesis of familiar motifs. Risky lyric compression pays off: the crystalline lattice reweights every prior image. Specificity (shattered porcelain mask, charcoal ash) prevents generic overlay. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
