<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—trading half-truths for money—is clear and consistent; interiority is tactile (“weight of half truths settle like dust on her palm”) yet emotion stays mercenary. Her final micro-choice (slipping the now-ready vial away) crystallizes the arc and keeps her at affectionate remove, leaving closure intact. Flaw is that her interior conflicts are almost entirely stated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure unit lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the charged petal is sealed, the emotion is now market-ready—options re-sorted with the felt cost that Mara now embodies. Causal beat chain (static collection → petal infusion → vial seal) stays taut; no teleporting props or outline drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto’s visual/sonic palette (“liquid gold…low resonant static…humming walls taste of old rain”) is distinctive and constrains the process—charging the stone is indispensable. Spatial tracking is coherent; early image returns in the final amber glow that “mirrors Mara's own composed satisfaction,” reweighting setting as mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—synthesize a sellable feeling—signals early and tightens by each step: subsuming ambient sentiment raises invisible cost, culminating in the “empty vial” that signals forfeiture of genuine empathy. Pressure is textual/cumulative rather than causal reversal; no additional reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Half-truth commerce explored through sensory praxis: “fusion of insight with empathy” emerges in static-borne distillation rather than thematic statement. Final image reweights the premise—Mara walks with “scent lingering on her skin like a secret promise”—a conceptual repricing that indicts consumer emotion without lecturing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Controlled free-indirect lyric: “static tasted of old rain” gives perceptual signature; cadence varies naturally under rising pressure. Occasional overwriting (stack of modifiers) and recycled sentence stems prevent 9+ but voice integrity remains intact throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Bright, dense sentences—“static crackle of untold grief yearning to be transformed”—carry triple freight. Minor loop alert: “subsume” repeated twice within three paragraphs and the static-as-sensor conceit rephrased; these blunt final polish but do not obscure cause/effect or clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: commodified olfactory grief trade grafted onto static-charged mysticism; trope inversion feels inevitable rather than gimmicky. Small deduction because the “static electricity reads emotions” conceit edges magical-realist convenience, shaving the risk point.</comment>
