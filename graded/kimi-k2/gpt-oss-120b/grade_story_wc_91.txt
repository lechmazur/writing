<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation to “understand the texture of transformation” is stated but never embodied in a concrete, contradictory choice; her passivity lets prophecy and coincidence do the work. The fisherman appears too late to pressure her into a crucible decision, so the relationship remains ornamental. Interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: pattern of glowing sand, firefly release, and celestial echo reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the luminous tapestry reconfigures meaning with felt cost. However, the decisive change is attributed to cosmic alignment more than Mara’s agency, slightly blurring causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Black sand, volcanic grit, and captive fireflies are vividly rendered and filter through Mara’s exhausted awe. The beach’s heat and glow constrain her movements and later charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting evolves with the sparks and comet-like trails, anchoring the scene without white-room drift.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s quest to feel transformation—is signaled early but escalates via external spectacle rather than narrowing choices. The prophecy tightens the pattern but does not force a trade-off or visible price from Mara herself. Pressure remains atmospheric; no single beat forces a costly decision under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation-as-texture emerges through the accumulating sensory motifs rather than explicit statement. The final luminous tapestry offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is present in the hush and glowing sand, though the fisherman’s ancestral prophecy edges toward overt thematic echo.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s perceptual signature: “warm volcanic grit,” “captive constellations.” Rhythm modulates with scene intensity; lyrical compression is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; the fisherman’s words remain filtered through Mara’s recognition.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“smoldering amber,” “velvet black,” “midnight oil”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative mode. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Strong verbs and sensory nouns keep momentum; final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of volcanic beach, bottled fireflies, and cosmic prophecy feels fresh, not checklist. Specificity of “black sand absorbing light” and “luminous carpet” transforms familiar tropes. Risk lies in the heavy lyricism, but coherence under the Accumulative lens keeps it from gimmickry.</comment>
