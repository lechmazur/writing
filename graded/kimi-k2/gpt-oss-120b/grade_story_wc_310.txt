<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “quietly enthusiastic” pulse undercuts cosmic fatalism—but the final alignment feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from contradictory impulses; no embodied cost is dramatized beyond a hushed echo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single tone fuses Silas’s heartbeat with the contracting cosmos, a felt cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds; every static pop tightens the pattern toward the final hum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ambered deck, violet mist, and cracked glass constrain Silas’s posture and echo his internal fracture; the micro-fracture letting the void whisper in charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—alignment with a dying universe’s last frequency—is signaled early and deepens through each decoded pop; the final narrowing to a single tone forces a stance crystallization with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: curiosity as rebellion against entropy. The backwards prophecy reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving a resonant afterimage of purpose as frequency rather than destination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet precise; patterned elision (“whispers of dying light,” “stellar doubt”) is taught early and paid off in the final hum. Perceptual signature remains singular and coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“ambered observatory deck hovered over the dimming stars”) risks overwriting yet stays within Silas’s reverent register and never muddles closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy mysticism and numismatic divination; the backwards prophecy and static-burst decoding feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
