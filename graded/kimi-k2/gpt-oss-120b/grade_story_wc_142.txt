<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her “tightrope” of dual loyalty is embodied in the moment she chooses the phoenix mural—but the old dock workers remain off-page abstractions, muting the relational crucible and the full cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: chip → graffiti map → layout shift → postponed privatization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the city’s “steadier rhythm” is won at the price of Mira’s perpetual vigilance, visible in the final image of her charting new routes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The raft city is tactile—creaking hulls, lantern-lit mist—and the shifting stalls physically enact the stakes. The foundation stone chip in its glass case anchors the final image, constraining future choices by reminding all of the fragile covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving communal autonomy against privatization—tightens through each graffiti-coded move. The decisive turn is the overnight reorganization that forces the council’s delay; the cost is the endless vigilance Mira now shoulders.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: community self-mapping as resistance. The phoenix mural reweights the graffiti from covert signal to public promise, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“hopeful desperation that rose like steam”—and stays anchored in Mira’s perceptual filter. No dialogue appears, so the internal cadence carries the narrative without drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but occasional stacked metaphors (“kaleidoscope of music, scent, and bright banners”) flirt with overwriting. Still, momentum never stalls, and the final phoenix image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating-carnival-as-resistance-network feels fresh; the graffiti-as-living-map device transforms a familiar gentrification plot into something specific and memorable.</comment>
