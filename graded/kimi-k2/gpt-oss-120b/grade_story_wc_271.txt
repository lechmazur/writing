<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Interior choices track lived trauma (somatic markers photo) but several arcs (pearl imagery, lighthouse past) float as decorative summary rather than scene-forced turns. Earned endurance at the end has cost on the page; motivation stays coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Causal linkage is mostly accumulative-lyric: one deepening layer at a time until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation stable; lighthouse timeline remains soft, not plot-forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Arboretum supplies sensory anchors and cliff-edge spatial pressure, but the mélange of pine-rosemary-sea-lavender feels catalogue rather than constraining choice. Setting does narrow options at the edge climb moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor hope while carrying grief) tightens once via the photograph-smooth ritual that re-weights the stillness concept; absence of antagonist keeps external pressure fiat-light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme surfaces organically from concrete embodied action, a small visual reprise at the end crystallises “keeping still is action with cost”; avoids moral signposting but also lacks deeper conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture and perceptual signature; purposeful compression in final paragraph lands the resonant stillness without head-hop; lacks spoken dialogue to stress voice distinction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm, compression, and sensory density keep momentum; minor repetitions (“she walked”, “she paused”) and elevated register toward end are forgivable. No clarity or propulsion loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesises well-known lyric trauma-nature framing but infuses fresh embodied detail of drone-survivor stillness; transformation feels organic in hindsight yet trends mid-field in risk-taking.</comment>
