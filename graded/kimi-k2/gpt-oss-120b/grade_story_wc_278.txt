<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s guilt-driven obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing lullabies with a silver needle, stitching amber to chassis—yet interior contradiction remains more asserted than dramatized; the final renunciation is earned and costly, but the moment of internal collision is narrated rather than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteor hush settles, guilt loosens, and the laboratory’s new cadence is the felt cost. Causal chain holds—letters → firmware → amber song—though the “time folds” mechanic is asserted more than demonstrated. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The laboratory’s rustling speakers, ash-painted constellations, and cracked oak desk constrain every move; the amber itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Lyra’s grief-sharpened perception. One minor spatial blur: “ceiling of dim constellations” vs. “amber-lit chamber” could clash if read literally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens once when the firmware loops collapse into the amber’s lull. Agency is renunciation: she seals the lull beneath the drawer, paying with perpetual custodianship. Cost is visible but could be sharper; the price feels communal more than personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief translated into caretaking, haunted code healed by compassion. The amber beetle’s lullaby reweights every prior sorrow without moralizing. Final image of the laboratory breathing like a living organ offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, dense, and consistent—phantom wind, meteor hush—yet always legible. Patterned elision (“time folds in on itself”) is taught early and paid off in the backward-ticking clocks. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Lyra’s grief-tuned ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; figurative language serves atmosphere without clogging beats. Occasional stacked metaphors (“neon lights flickered like dying stars… meteor hush tone”) flirt with excess yet stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-frequency laboratory, beetle-translated baby cries, and guilt-easing firmware synthesize into a singular, non-obvious whole. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh; risk lies in the lyric density, but coherence never falters. Transformation test: story collapses if any core element is swapped.</comment>
