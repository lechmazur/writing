<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied memory of the sea and her tactile handling of the fork/case give credible interiority; the final choice to “carry the song” is earned by prior heat-mapping trials. Yet the shift from private grief to public pilgrimage is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the cost of exposure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the single chord converts silence into communal song, cost felt in the relinquishing of private grief. Accumulative lens holds—each heat pulse layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is rendered through frost, echo, and rose-veined glass; its acoustic properties literally shape the climax. The bench, fork, and hovering lattice act as micro-settings that constrain gesture and amplify tone, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens once via the heat-map’s feedback loop; the rising warmth narrows options to share or hoard the sound. Cost is visible: Mara’s private scars become public resonance. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between private survival and shared wonder; the unshaken marvels are reweighted from personal talisman to communal beacon without moralizing. Final chord offers non-literal answer: silence not erased but transfigured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with perceptual signature rooted in tactile memory—rope-calloused hands, velvet case, frost-hum. Syntax modulates from long frost-laden clauses to the clipped release of the final chord. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves acoustic imagery without clutter. Minor loop risk in “silence” repetitions is offset by rhythmic variation. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fusion of maritime trauma, acoustic science, and glass architecture feels fresh; tuning fork as emotional seismograph is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the crystalline final image.</comment>
