<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“guilt-ridden,” “gnaws at the conscience”), but the decisive shift to honesty is asserted more than dramatized; the watch-hand placement feels symbolic rather than a micro-choice that visibly costs him a client or reputation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the withheld truth is weighed and the ledger of lies re-priced. Causal chain holds—summons → shore → carving alignment → watch-hand key—yet the stranger’s motivation remains off-stage, a mild ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace and driftwood shore are rendered with selective sensory detail; the terrace reprises in the final image, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clear, though the boat journey is compressed to a single sentence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quelling guilt by uncovering a withheld truth—is signaled early and tightened when the carvings align into a moral reckoning. Cost is conceptual (weight of truth) rather than external, satisfying at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited versus manufactured identity emerges through the genealogist’s trade and the driftwood “false memories.” Final phrase reweights the premise without moralizing, though the driftwood’s sentient hum edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; diction (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”) is consistent with the narrator’s profession and remorse. No dialogue, so focus stays on internal cadence, which modulates under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic; occasional stacked metaphors (“chorus of old testimonies,” “tide of remorse”) risk overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; rhythm serves the elegiac tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the con-artist trope: a genealogist who forges lineages confronts his own fabricated past. Driftwood as living archive feels novel, though the watch-hand-as-key leans familiar.</comment>
