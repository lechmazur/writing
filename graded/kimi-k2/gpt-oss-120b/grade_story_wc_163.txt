<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria’s interiority is lyrical but thin; her contradictory impulses (“to captivate spirits” vs. “asking for guidance”) are stated rather than dramatized. The final “feeling of belonging” is earned by ritual, not by a visible cost or choice that forecloses another path. Micro-choices (placing the feather, playing instruments) are present but feel pre-ordained, not pressured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the holographic constellations fade at dawn, leaving Aria with a “shared exhale of wonder” and a charged poise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers luminous imagery until the final cadence shift. Cost is felt in the fading light and her emergence “with the burnt feather clutched to her chest,” though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The underwater city is evoked with selective, synesthetic detail (“bioluminescent algae…a breath held in amber”). The glass panels and coral pedestal constrain her ritual choices, and the firefly-lit corridor literally guides her deeper. The setting charges the final image: the dome mirrors her desert charts, making environment and tool inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened by the dawn deadline. Pressure escalates through accumulating luminous layers rather than causal reversals; the final fade-out crystallizes the cost of transience. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, aligning) rather than decisive, but the stance crystallizes with felt loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging-as-cosmos emerges through mirrored constellations and tidal rhythms, never stated outright. The final image of ash-turned-map reweights the premise: belonging is fluid, not fixed. Subtext is sustained in gesture and light, though the epiphany edges close to overt lyric assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled compression (“steps softly ingenious”). Perceptual signature is strong: Aria notices like an astrologer—mapping, mirroring, calibrating. No dialogue, so no register drift; internal monologue stays within her plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates with scene tension, accelerating toward the dawn fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous respite…shadowseam wonder”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motion. Minor register drift (“conceptual repricing” feel in “cosmos of belonging”) but clarity intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fusion of desert astrology and drowned city feels fresh; the burnt feather as star-map is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the mirrored constellations. No derivative echoes; the premise would collapse if transplanted wholesale.</comment>
