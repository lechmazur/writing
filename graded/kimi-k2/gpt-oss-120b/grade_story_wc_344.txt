<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “driftwood nostalgia” and “rhythm of repair” are evocative yet remain labels. The locksmith’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear of endless task) flicker but never collide in a single beat. Micro-choice to whisper the prophecy line is clean and earns the gear’s click, yet the cost feels diffuse—more mood than forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hall melts into a corridor of time and the clock ticks again, cost paid in the weight of “heartbeat steadied.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each mirrored era layers density until the final amber pulse reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Frozen library, crystal volumes that sing, and mirrored hall are vivid, selective, and thematically charged. The mirrored panes literally reconfigure into a corridor of time—setting becomes engine of closure. Micro-setting (silver box, gear pedestal) constrains the final act. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tightened when the gears’ silence demands a key. One meaningful deepening: mirrors ripple into living time, forcing the locksmith to confront fractured selves. Cost is felt in the “heartbeat steadied” weight, though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair as temporal stewardship emerges through image and action, never statement. Final amber glow reweights earlier frost without moralizing. Subtext whispers in the mirrors’ song and the locksmith’s reluctant hope. Resonance lingers in the ticking clock under his arm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic cadences that mirror the celestial subject. Perceptual signature—“coat frayed like old driftwood,” “ink trembling like sea-foam”—is consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports the hush-then-surge arc. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial alignments”) fits the mythic register without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—celestial locksmith carving keys from moon-shadow—feels fresh yet inevitable. Mirrors-as-time-corridor transforms a familiar trope into thematic engine. Specificity of “crystal volumes that sang” and “gear shimmering like frozen rain” anchors the fantastical. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
