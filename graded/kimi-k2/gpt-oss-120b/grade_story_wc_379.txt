<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is gentle but generic; her “discerning” trait is asserted, not embodied. The decisive act—placing the locket on the bench—reads as symbolic rather than driven by a visible internal contradiction. No cost is dramatized; the emotional arc flattens into affirmation. The boy’s arrival repeats the pattern without deepening it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each letter and whisper layers resonance. Closure is a Charged Poise—the courtyard becomes a listening shrine—but the cost is only asserted (“world’s noise faded”), not dramatized. Orientation is clear, yet the causality between hearing and healing remains abstract. One transition (shop → courtyard) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—wet stone, incense, lantern flicker—but the courtyard never physically constrains choice; it serves as mood board. The locket’s glow and the mailbox’s rust are tactile, yet neither object alters tactics. Micro-setting (bench, letters) is present but decorative. Meets 8+ gate only on vividness, not constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“prove that listening heals”—is declared early but never tested under pressure. Escalation is textural: more names, more letters, more gratitude notes. No option is foreclosed, no price paid. The boy’s arrival restarts the cycle rather than tightening it. Conflict remains gentle and static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of communal healing through listening emerges organically from the accumulating letters, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of the boy opening the locket offers quiet resonance, but the conceptual cost is soft. Subtext is present yet thin; ambiguity feels safe rather than charged. Avoids sermonizing but also avoids risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara; perceptual signature is consistent but not striking. Rhythm is smooth, with purposeful repetition (“sandstorm calm”) that accrues meaning. No dialogue appears, so voice purity is maintained. Occasional elevated diction (“narrative pulse”) nudges out of Mara’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, lyrical, and largely free of loops; only minor scaffold (“each item a whispered story”). Figurative language is restrained and coherent. Information density is moderate—some sentences could compress further. No artifacts touch the closure beat. Read-aloud rhythm is pleasing but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox mystery and locket are familiar motifs; their combination feels gentle rather than transformative. Neighborhood storytelling as healing device is fresh in execution but not conceptually bold. Specific details (baker, librarian) add texture, yet the story could swap names and places without structural loss. Risk level is modest.</comment>
