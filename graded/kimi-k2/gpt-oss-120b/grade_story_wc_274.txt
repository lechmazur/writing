<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren’s contradictory impulses—guardian vs. liberator—are embodied in the tremor she feels when the letter ignites; the cost of possible “frozen preservation” is named and felt. Interiority is specific (“the cold itself approved of the heat”) rather than diagnostic. The final smile and green shoots crystallize an earned, costly stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library shifts from tomb to lighthouse, the cost is the scandal now irreversible. Causal chain—letter → sigil → tremor → open letters—holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “cracked marble column” and “snow-white walls” are not mere scenery; they act as conduit and canvas for the letter’s bleed, constraining Maren’s single insertion point and charging the final image of melting snow. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation vs. peace—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the councilor “felt the tremor in his marrow.” One decisive intensification suffices; the price is the irreversible scandal and Maren’s personal risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed dissent emerges from the concrete act of slipping a letter into a dormant conduit; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final green shoots reweight the premise without preaching, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and consistent: “ink still warm,” “shiver traveling down a frozen spine.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short pulses during ignition, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is Maren’s alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, stakes, or atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. The final “tiny green shoots peeking through the cracks” is precise and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The cryogenic-archivist-in-snowbound-library frame feels fresh; the dormant-network conduit and “dangerous liaison letter” transform familiar rebellion tropes into a singular, inevitable synthesis. Risky compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
