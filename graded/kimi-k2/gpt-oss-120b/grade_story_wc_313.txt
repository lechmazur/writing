<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Caitlyn’s vigilance and quiet observational ethic are embodied in gait and gaze, but the interior contradiction between myth-busting duty and inherited storytelling craft remains summary; the final “smile” feels unearned because the cost of renouncing her own myth-spinning past is never dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: photographs accrue meaning until the sapphire label and wind-chime reprise crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration—collective memory reclaimed. Closure lands with conceptual cost (town’s fear released), though the causal link between label placement and crowd catharsis is slightly elliptical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Midnight ridgeway, lantern glow on water, and the cracked-window chime create tactile, selective atmosphere; the reservoir’s mirrored surface becomes a charged object that reflects both literal and remembered floods, constraining Caitlyn’s final stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—erasing a false myth—escalates as each photograph tightens the evidentiary noose; the final communal silence is a felt price, though the beat-to-beat pressure is more accretive than sharply intensifying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth-through-story emerges organically from the photograph trail and sapphire label; the mirrored hush ending offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, but a touch of abstract “shared narrative” phrasing nudges it short of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, controlled third-person limited stays close to Caitlyn’s perceptual bias; syntax modulates from hushed description to cadenced revelation. No POV drift, though occasional elevated diction (“crystallized certainty”) edges toward register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the hush-to-revelation arc; a few stacked metaphors (“silver ribbon,” “ancient eye”) flirt with overwriting but do not clog closure. Clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Reservoir-town myth-busting via photograph archaeology feels fresh; the sapphire label and wind-chime callbacks create specific, non-generic resonance. Risk level is moderate—lyric accretion rather than structural daring—but the synthesis is coherent.</comment>
