<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is distinct and embodied (“restless mind”), yet the protagonist stays largely in receptive mode; micro-choices feel light, so the internal cost at closure leans reflective rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure unit is a Charged Poise: “hush that would keep beating beneath the surface” crystallizes options and charges earlier motifs; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density build across hush beats, cost felt through shared surrender of city-noise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory triangulation of bay, cottages, and perfumer’s shop grounds every move; the orris shard functioning as micro-setting that constrains choice (silence amplifier) edges near 9.0 gate but lacks direct physical repercussion on body/placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“arming” the houses with hush—tightens once via the shard’s deployment; agency is gentle but present, though the visible price paid feels lightly staged rather than jeopardizing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme emerges refractively through images of silence as communal heartbeat; final image reweights premise by showing lived silence as creative force, but once the perfume-shop thesis line arrives, direct articulation dilutes earlier subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, coast-biased diction (“salty lullaby,” “amber halos stretch like lazy thoughts”) reads singular; pattern-teaching elision (“the air tasting…,” “the streetlights, now fully awake”) stays legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs, but slight overwarming in metaphors (e.g., “slow, warm ember”) blunts urgency; minor synonym loops across hush repetitions stall pure momentum while clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Conceptually fresh—weaponizing orris-silence—but the “shard of forgotten prayer” note edges familiar overt fantasy; the bay-town conduit logic is specific enough to feel earned rather than gimmick.</comment>
