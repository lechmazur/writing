<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s calm is embodied in micro-choices—scanning walls, whispering promises—but her interior contradiction (healer vs. archivist) stays summary. The final feather gesture crystallizes her stance with visible cost, yet the villagers remain off-page chorus, so relationship crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each photograph added thickens the emotional weave until the luminous constellation reconfigures communal memory. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the feather’s dusting reweights the past with felt cost—though the causal chain between vines feeding memory and the arcs brightening is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lavender scent and rusted girders are filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias; the vines physically climbing the steel echo the photographs’ arcs, constraining her decision to stay. Micro-setting (map case, feather) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective healing—tightens as each photograph narrows the emotional route from pain to masterpiece. One meaningful deepening: the arcs pulse brighter under living vines, forcing Mara’s promise to linger. Cost is communal tears and her open-ended guardianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting pain into shared beauty emerges through the accumulating arcs and the villagers’ tear-streaked smiles; no moralizing statement intrudes. Final feather image offers non-literal answer—hope as light dust—reweighting prior sorrow without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—purple perfume, whispered secrets, dove gray—remains consistent under pressure. Compression and patterned elision (“arcs brightening as if the plant life itself were feeding the story”) teach the reader the accumulative logic early and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and memory without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“transmute pain into a masterpiece”) slightly drifts from Mara’s grounded voice but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-town memory constellation via overlapping B&W arcs is fresh; transformation test passes—story would collapse without lavender/vine symbiosis. Risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
