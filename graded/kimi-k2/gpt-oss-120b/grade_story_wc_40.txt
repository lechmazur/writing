<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—her “weathered innocence” and “reticent heart” are embodied in micro-choices like folding the page as an offering. The contradiction between clinging to printed words and accepting their eclipse is dramatized, not stated. The final renunciation (leaving the page, accepting impermanence) carries visible cost and is earned by the crystal’s testimony. Minor slip: the phrase “weathered innocence” is repeated without deepening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the crystal’s glints accumulate into a pattern that reweights Mara’s quest. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her stance shifts from decoding to offering, cost legible in the folded page and fading glow. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library’s “must of old paper” and “cracked stained glass” are filtered through Mara’s scholar gaze, constraining her movements and pacing her breath. The crystal’s facets act as micro-setting, guiding her final gesture. Sensory economy is high; no static cataloguing. The dawn light evolves causally with the crystal’s chorus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve linguistic memory vs. accept its digital dissolution—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each glint tightens the lattice until the crystal’s chorus answers her. The cost is the realization that no dictionary can hold what she now knows, forcing the offering. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence and flux; the crystal’s rings-of-a-tree metaphor reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the folded page as prayer, the lullaby as blessing. Final image reconfigures meaning: growth is a living pulse, not a captured lexicon. Avoids tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“suspended hush settled like a veil”). Perceptual signature is Mara’s—she hears light as sound, sees time in facets. No POV drift; diction stays within her scholarly lexicon. Compression is purposeful; elisions taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image and idea. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Minor overwriting in “sonically reflective shards of light” but does not stall momentum. Final cadence breathes with the fading glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise—library as living memory, crystal as arboreal language—feels fresh yet inevitable. Synthesizes archive nostalgia with speculative linguistics through specific sensory detail. Risk in lyric mode pays off; no gimmickry. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if crystal were merely a lamp.</comment>
