<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her “underachieving” label is asserted rather than dramatized; the keystone moment crystallizes her stance, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to her flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the keystone’s glow reweights the premise, and the mist-walk descent forecloses her old identity. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire and perpetual twilight are selective, atmospheric, and integrated into action; the keystone itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the sacred from automation—escalates through the keystone insertion and mist-walk surrender; cost is felt in the deliberate slowness and relinquishment of speed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred resides in imperfection and surrender, not Engine output. Final snowflake image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent, with purposeful compression and patterned repetition that serve the accumulative lens. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional near-repetition (“luminance…light…glow”) flirts with loop but stays within voice. No artifacts touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar automation-anxiety premise is refreshed through the keystone’s mythic logic and mist-walk ritual; synthesis feels inevitable, risk-taking modest but coherent.</comment>
