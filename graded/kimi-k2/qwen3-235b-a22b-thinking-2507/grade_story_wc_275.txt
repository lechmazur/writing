<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist stance collides with her violent legacy in a single, embodied beat: the deliberate sheathing of the dagger. The internal contradiction—violence vs nurture—drives the climax and is paid for by the risk of losing the farm. Minor slip: “senselessly perceptive” is asserted more than dramatized beyond noticing leaf angles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the act of sheathing the dagger and shielding the seedling with the sandbag reconfigures the conflict from fight to nurture, with the raiders’ retreat as earned stasis. Causal lens holds: because she kneels and shields, they hesitate and leave. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glass dome, wind-borne ash, and the sandbag scrap are tactile constraints that shape Elara’s final move—using the scrap as shield. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her gardener’s priorities. The “tranquil blaze” of dusk charges the final image without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the farm without bloodshed—tightens when raiders appear. Escalation is a single, coherent pressure beat: weapons raised vs unarmed kneeling. Cost is the gamble of vulnerability; the payoff is the raiders’ retreat and the preserved quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuity-through-care emerges from concrete action: the engraved quiet moves from sandbag to soil, reweighting violence into nurture. No moralizing; the final image of glowing roses against dusk answers the thematic question wordlessly.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias—leaf angles, tremor in struts—without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer cadence in calm, clipped fragments under threat. Voice remains consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “velvety petal,” “dust-choked sky,” “gritty weight” all serve atmosphere and action. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either tension or image. One mixed metaphor—“tranquil blaze”—but it’s earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic pacifist gardener who weaponizes quiet is fresh synthesis. The sandbag-as-shield turn feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Minor deduction for familiar “raiders at the dome” setup, but the inversion of defense-by-nurture redeems it.</comment>
