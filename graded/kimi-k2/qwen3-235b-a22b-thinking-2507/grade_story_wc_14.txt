<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling finger, the hum in her molars, the tears of “aching connection.” Motivation is clear and intensifies: from studious observer to desperate refractor of time. The final beat crystallizes her stance—she prepares for the next resonance—earning a quiet but felt cost. Only the absence of a second character keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory fragments builds until the cherry-blossom overlay ruptures the present. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s tear-stung eyes and poised charcoal mark an Earned Stasis that forecloses normal life. Causality holds: the lamp’s hum → waveform → phantom season → dissipation → next attempt. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The bonsai, lamp, and mountain air are not backdrop but instruments: the juniper’s branches become sakura-laden under the lamp’s vibration, constraining how Elara maps time. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—perfume of 1862 Kyoto arrives as tactile “cool silk.” Micro-setting (the crooked fluorescent) directly enables the climax. Meets 9-band gate: the lamp charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—salvage lost textures before silence devours them—tightens when the cherry-blossom scent proves the method works and vanishes, leaving only the cost of yearning. One meaningful intensification: the hum falters, scent dissolves, stakes sharpen. Agency is attention and endurance; no external antagonist needed. Cost is felt in the “aching connection” and silent town below.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: memory as palimpsest, history as resonance rather than record. Subtext lives in the gilded leaf pin—fragile craft persisting amid ruin. No moralizing; the final image of poised charcoal reweights the premise without statement. Complexity lingers: invented histories may be the only truth left.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“incandescent restraint,” “phantom season”—mirroring Elara’s studious intensity. Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic mapping of sound to time. No dialogue, so no register drift. Patterned elision (the town’s silence) is taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences swell, then fracture as the hum falters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers texture or advances the beat. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“bloom-ing labyrinth,” “paper-thin hope.” No loops or scaffold; information multi-tasks. Minor elevation in diction (“temporal coordinates”) is justified by Elara’s vocation. Closure line is clean, crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—time-textures harvested from a dying fluorescent lamp via bonsai resonance—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes of apocalypse and memory are transformed through tactile specificity. Risky lyric compression pays off: the cherry-blossom overlay feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
