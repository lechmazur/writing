<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority thrums with precise contradiction: the same chill water that threatens her lungs fuels the “quiet resolve” driving her fingers. Micro-choice—“scooped up the hangman's dice… placed them gently”—crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Moment-to-moment fear is embodied, never named or therapized. Final renunciation earns its cost in the image of rising water and liberated code.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Rising water tightens each gesture; dance-as-decoder is a legible physical constraint. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration: the same web-pattern that claimed the lab now cradles the freed Aegis algorithms—“smooth and inevitable as a spider spinning its web.” Causality holds from dice roll through embodied cipher to satellite upload; price is felt cold on skin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Concrete specificity nails orientation: “algae-slick wall… cold water soaking her boots.” Micro-setting—the terminal and dice—constrains every choreography move. Water height provides immediate clock; “groan of stressed metal above” is tactile threat that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Water rise is relentless pressure with visible, felt cost tightening options once. Single stake—save Aegis—remains singular; no artificial reversals. Dance decision is active narrowing: only this cipher key opens the gate. Luck (dice roll) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme encoded not preached: vulnerability encrypted as strength emerges from Elara’s choreography of fear. Final tableau—“tomb of knowledge now a cradle of resilience”—reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; resonance is in bodily cost against abstract code.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice stays consistent and textured. “She was the lyrical code breaker” is declaration from distance, yet subsequent perception filters detail through her bias. Vocabulary never steps outside plausible lexicon. Rhythm scales naturally with rising water.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold, no loops. “Water seeped steadily… strand by glistening strand” is image over exposition. Sentences carry multiple jobs—atmosphere, time, cost. Final line’s spider simile crystallizes earlier motif without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aegis as quantum code shield woven from fear is non-obvious; embodied dance-decoding breaks the abstract-cipher trope. Premise commits fully; specificity prevents template drift. Fresh inflection lies in the marriage of bodily risk to digital salvation.</comment>
