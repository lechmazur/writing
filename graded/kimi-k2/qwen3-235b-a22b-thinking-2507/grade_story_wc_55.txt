<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—perfectionist dream vs. caretaker reality—is embodied in micro-choices (lowering the oiler, gentling his satchel). The bear encounter crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost: he releases the ghost of the Eternal Chronometer. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance. Only the repeated “excruciatingly gentle” edges toward label-speak, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of stillness, scent, and light increases until the bear’s thrum breaks pattern, reweighting Elias’s goal. Closure is Earned Stasis—he accepts imperfection and forecloses the quest, cost legible in the lighter satchel and “quiet companion” dream. Orientation anchored by ~120 words. No causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Crystal forecourt, rain-slick quartz, and grizzled bear are rendered with selective sensory economy; each constrains Elias’s movement and charges the final image. The mirrored sunrise on wet stone reconfigures meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static cataloguing. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains choice and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned perfection—is signaled early and tightened once: bear’s presence forces Elias to renounce the quest. Cost is felt in the “weight resting lightly now.” Agency is renunciation, not confrontation; sufficient for 600-word scope. No escalation beyond single deepening, but that deepening is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: perfection vs. presence. The bear’s wordless being reframes Elias’s pursuit without moralizing. Final image of sunrise gilding silent clocks offers non-literal answer—peace found in release, not capture. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile precision, synesthetic scent-memory, glacial hush as lived texture. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences contract into spare stillness during bear encounter. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“petrichor nostalgia”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting. Minor repetition of “excruciatingly gentle” is the only blemish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clock-repair mysticism meets Ursine epiphany. Bear as living chronometer subverts trope of mechanical eternity. Specificity of scent, tool, and light renders the familiar strange. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
