<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—yearning to feel time yet recoiling from its texture—are embodied in trembling fingers and blank photographs. The micro-choice to grasp the fragment is credibly driven by prior causality and carries a visible cost: the erasure of his daughter’s image. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final renunciation—leaving the blank photo behind—earns its weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the texture of time is revealed as grief, and the garden’s collapse reweights every prior beat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases until the bridge sighs apart. Orientation is taught early via impossible hedges and blurred workmen. The cost is legible in the blank photograph and the ruins under an untouched sky.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop but antagonist: its breathing hedges and warped paths constrain every move. Hyperbolic folds are felt in snagging roots and ozone air, guiding Aris’s crawl toward the fragment. The final collapse snaps space back to Euclidean normalcy, charging the ending with absence. Environment, body, and tool merge to shape the decisive choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape or surrender to time’s texture—tightens once when the fragment begins to unspool. Agency is Aris’s decision to grasp it, which triggers irreversible collapse. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens: each cycle dissolves more memory until the photograph is blank. The cost is visible in the ruined garden and the watermark clock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: time is grief, and memory is its residue. The blank photograph and crumbling bridge reweight every prior image without moralizing. Subtext lives in the ivy’s “startled nerves” and the bridge’s relieved sigh. The final image—ordinary soil “infinitely heavy with absence”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “ink bleeding into ghostly smudges like smoke caught in amber” teaches the pattern early. Compression and elision (“the world dissolved into quaking reverie”) are legible under the Accumulative lens. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent even under temporal stress. Final cadence—“grief lived in the hollow where memories used to be”—crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: each sentence layers sensory and conceptual freight. Metaphors are precise—“time… gritty as sand… viscous as cooled honey”—and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph’s syntactic hush mirrors the bridge’s sigh, tightening closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, hyperbolic horticulture, and chroniton physics feels inevitable, not gimmicked. The living bridge as temporal prison is a fresh angle on the maze trope. Risky compression and non-Euclidean imagery heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration—time as grief—could not survive transplantation to another setting.</comment>
