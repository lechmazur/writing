<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obliging nature and hidden ambition are embodied through tactile micro-choices (wiping frost, trembling at the lever). The final pull crystallizes her internal contradiction—duty vs. theory—at visible cost (tears freeze, circuits realign). Motivation is clear and escalates to the decisive act. Minor: the “obliging” trait is asserted more than tested in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: time’s lateral flow is proven, Elara’s stance shifts from ridiculed dreamer to solitary victor. Causal linkage holds: because she pulls the lever, the nexus flares and data confirms her theory. Orientation is swift; stakes tighten once, then crystallize. Cost is felt in the “icy warmth of solitude.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glacial ridge station and dormant leviathans anchor place and mood; the viewport frost and mechanically warm conduits constrain Elara’s movements and charge the final image. Sensory selection is biased by her technician’s eye. The environment does not merely backdrop—it enables the experiment. Could edge higher if the leviathans’ stillness actively limited options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: the lever pull redirects nexus power, flaring auroras and impossible clocks. Cost is the risk of discovery and the solitude that follows. Agency is clear; coincidence absent. Pressure tightens but does not double-back; sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the hush of beating wings at rest: stillness as the crucible for paradigm shift. Subtext lives in the contrast between external silence and internal revolution. The ending reweights the “poetic nonsense” into tangible truth without moralizing. A hairline slip: “time moves sideways” is nearly stated outright mid-scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly cool—fitting a mechanic who thinks in conduits and calibrations. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer clauses during reflection, clipped fragments at the lever. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Distinct perceptual signature: she notices servos, ozone, frost patterns—never tourist detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional lyrical lift (“bruised twilight sky”) is earned. One loop risk: “mechanically warm” repeats three times; each use deepens meaning, so only a −0.1 tap. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. High density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time premise is familiar, but grounding it in avian leviathans and a glacial nexus feels fresh. Transformation test: swap setting and the emotional arc collapses. The subdued awakening trope is inverted—no spectacle, only data and frost. Risk is taken in the quiet closure and pays off.</comment>
