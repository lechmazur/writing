<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—compliance vs. ancestral defiance—drives every beat; the lantern’s legacy crystallizes her final micro-choice to risk her career. Embodied emotion (phantom chill, hand on wall) anchors memory surges without label-speak. Motivation escalates from quiet guilt to explicit rebellion, cost legible in the decision to file against orders.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: drought chaos → staged death → scalpel proof → footprint match → irrevocable report. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the safe path with lantern raised, cost visible in the phrase “consequences be damned.” Orientation is swift; no lens drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tunnel’s wet concrete, rust stink, and dripping pipe constrain movement and sharpen sound; the lantern’s brass warmth and historical weight physically guide and morally charge the final image. Micro-setting (discarded scalpel in pooled water) supplies the decisive clue. Details are filtered through Elara’s investigative gaze, never touristy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. bureaucratic silence—tightens when the scalpel and footprint prove murder; each clue raises personal cost. Agency is continuous: observation → collection → decision to defy. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the supervisor’s shoe size is earned deduction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of inherited moral duty emerges through the lantern’s reprise; no explicit thesis. Subtext in the scuff marks, blood-crusted blade, and final lifted light reframes “accidental” as systemic cover-up. Final image offers resonant non-moral: flame steady, rebellion quiet but irreversible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly inside Elara’s perceptual filter; sensory selection (“wet concrete and rust,” “brass fittings worn smooth”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses under pressure, longer reflective lines when memory surges. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “water dripped steadily…hollow rhythm that echoed the heartbeat” does double sensory and metaphorical work. No loops, no filler; each sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse, precise, and never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing Underground Railroad lantern with modern forensic noir feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The drought-ending rain as cover-up device is fresh; the supervisor’s shoe print twist grows organically from Elara’s empirical method. Risky quiet rebellion lands with lasting afterimage.</comment>
