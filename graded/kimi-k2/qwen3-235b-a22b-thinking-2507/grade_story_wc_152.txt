<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scatterbrained façade vs razor-sharp operative—drives every beat; her micro-choice to drop the thimble while counting seconds crystallizes the hierarchy of values. The cost is visible: each “clumsy” act tightens the noose of risk around her. Flaw (necessary deception) complicates tactics and is not tidily resolved. Voice remains specific and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore (anomaly → decoding → transmission window → pulse). Closure is a Decisive Change—the warning sent, the coup’s timetable pierced—with felt cost in the candle’s tremble and the guard’s laughter that still endangers her. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One meaningful tightening: the dome’s rotation narrows the window to seven minutes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory’s brass, velvet, and slit are not backdrop but instruments: the dome’s rotation dictates the transmission beat, the candle’s flame is weaponized. Autumn decay and cobalt shadows mirror the covert rot of the state. Specificity is selective—one mirrored shard, one ventilation slit—yet constrains every move. Micro-setting (the candle) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get the coordinates out before dawn—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is causal: each guard pass raises the price of discovery, the rotating dome compresses time to a seven-minute aperture. The tightening choice (risk the mirror flash) forecloses the option to wait; cost is the audible guard footsteps and the candle’s flicker that could betray her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “listening to unheard stories” emerges through action: decoding silent stars, pulsing light across silence. Final constellation—a stitched candle—offers non-literal resonance: the unheard now have a voice in the dark. No moralizing; complexity remains in the risk she still faces. Subtext lives in dropped thimble and echoed laughter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise sensory embroidery terms, rhythmic control under pressure (“three, two, one—until the dome’s gears groaned”). POV modesty intact: she never knows more than she can see. Compression purposeful; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven: “Still dropping things, thread-minder?” carries subtext of power and contempt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or tactic. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are controlled—“clockwork beast” fits the observatory’s brass—and do not clog urgency. Strong verbs (“pierced,” “skittered,” “hammered”) propel momentum. Final line anchors cadence and recharges motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spy-thriller mechanics rendered through textile craft and astronomical detail. Disguise-as-embroidery feels inevitable, not gimmick; the candle-flame Morse is a risk-heightening invention. Specificity of cobalt observatory in autumn roots the stakes. Transformation test fails—this could not swap settings without collapse. Risk-taking pays off in clarity.</comment>
