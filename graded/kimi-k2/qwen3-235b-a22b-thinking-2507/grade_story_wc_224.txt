<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief vs. the need to read—are dramatized in the tactile choice to press the feather to stone; the cost (re-opening the wound) is embodied in the surge of memory. Interiority is specific and embodied (“tears cut paths through the dust”), not diagnostic. The final renunciation—carrying home inside her skin—earns its poise through prior causality. Minor slip: “buried talents lay dormant” is slightly label-speak, but immediately dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nightly reality collapses, but the seeded feather now pulses with warmth, reweighting the premise that home must be sought externally. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory glyph adds density until the pattern crystallizes. Cost is legible in the moment she scrapes the stone: “the mountain’s memory surged into her bones.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but active constraint: corridors fold like origami, guiding her to the alcove; the stone’s cold grooves mirror the village roofline, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (“air thick with hidden thunder”). Environment constrains choice and is reweighted at closure when the labyrinth becomes sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the shape of home—is signaled early and tightened when the stone’s glyphs demand the buried talent; the price is the flood of memory she had sealed away. One meaningful deepening: the stone translates into sensation, not sound, forcing her to accept the cost of remembering. Agency drives escalation; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: home as constellation of textures rather than place. The final image—feather pulsing against her chest—offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence after the glyphs flare; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature vivid (“ink bled from books”). Patterned elision (dream/reality shifts) is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences collapse into shorter cadence at dawn. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“the slope of a thatched roof mirroring a mountain ridge”). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and coherent. Rhythm accelerates during the thunder-crack moment, then exhales at dawn. One near-miss: “hidden thunder” is repeated, but serves as motif taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—mountain-bookstore that dreams—feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesized through Elara’s grief. The raven-feather-as-key transforms a familiar trope into specific, tactile magic. Risky structure (dream-logic) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; voice and world cohere as singular vision.</comment>
