<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (guilt vs hope, certainty vs doubt) manifest on-page when “confidently uncertain resolve” steers her unbending of the pen. Interior contradiction and micro-choices are embodied—“hands moved with confidently uncertain grace”—and the final renunciation of certainty as purpose earns a visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is earned via an in-scene Decisive Change: the gravitational anomaly accepts the edits, the station lurches, spirals unwind, and Elara experiences “peace.” Causality holds under the Hybrid lens (Situational pressure + Causal ripple); penalty −0.1 only for a brief explanatory lull mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The anomaly itself is the micro-setting constraining choice (“gravitational anomaly… warps time like light”). Spatial grounding on the station is vivid and guides every tactical beat; only minor drift as the planet beneath is mentioned not seen, so cap prevents 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—undo the toxic seed decision—is signaled at once. Escalation deepens when each stroke of the pen narrows options and visibly raises spatial cost (“station groaned… stars stutter”). One meaningful tightening: the anomaly’s pulsed response locks in the attempt with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specifics: threshing meaning from regret, not literal harvest. Final image reweights premise—“meaning wasn’t in the harvest but in the threshing” delivers Resonant Reconfiguration without moral sermonizing. Sustained organic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose texture is lyric and consistent; internal voice remains distinct under strain; purposeful compression (“capillary channels… condensed starlight”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure. Minor register drift into abstract cadence at one clause keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with urgency during anomaly pulses; figurative language is selective and never repeats. One small redundancy—“the anomaly... anomaly...”—in adjacent sentences trims the tip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The star-correcting fountain pen is a fresh symbolic conceit that fuses terraforming disaster with relativistic mechanics. While cosmic time-editing stories exist, this specific image/pen integration is unlikely in another context. No direct genre echoes; risk balanced against familiarity.</comment>
