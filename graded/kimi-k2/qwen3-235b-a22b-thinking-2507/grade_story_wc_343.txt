<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing brass, brushing dirt, aligning hopscotch angles—each action tethered to her isolation and discovery. The interior contradiction (yearning for connection yet choosing solitary charting) is dramatized, not stated. Final renunciation of rescue in favor of mapping the moment carries visible cost: she accepts continued solitude for knowledge. One slip: “tears pricked” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied ledger asterisk rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hopscotch board reframed from child’s game to celestial lens reweights the premise with undeniable cost—she must now navigate alone. Causal chain holds: dog-ear → hopscatch numbers → starling intervals → Solis bearing. Fog occlusion and stranded status are persistent constraints shaping tactics. No orientation drift; anchors (airship deck, twilight) are fixed by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Antique airship deck, brass railing, fog, and chalk grime are filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze; each detail constrains movement or sightline. The hopscotch board evolves from setting to tool, charging the final triangulation. Starling murmurations act as living sextant, their shadows metering time. Micro-setting (ledger, charcoal nub) functions as extension of body under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting a path beyond the Veil—tightens when fog hides Solis, forcing Elara to decode starling choreography. One decisive deepening: realization that hopscotch clusters are coordinates, narrowing options from passive waiting to active triangulation. Cost is legible: acceptance of continued isolation in exchange for epistemic gain. Escalation is accumulative/textural—pattern density increases until the bearing crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of perception-as-creation emerges from concrete acts: chalk numbers, bird formations, ledger sketches. No thematic statement; resonance arises when “stranded luminance” flips from trap to beacon. Final whispered thanks reconfigures isolation as chosen communion with sky. Subtext in dog-ear’s “silent plea” lingers without explication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly archaic—“calloused fingers,” “luminous strata”—consistent with apprentice-mapper POV. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under calculation. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Distinct perceptual signature: numbers, angles, refracted light dominate sensory hierarchy. Patterned elision (ellipses between beats) is taught early and paid off in rhythmic starling counts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers map-work vocabulary without clutter. Metaphors (“starlings like spilled ink”) are singular and apt. No loops or scaffold; “dust motes danced” appears once and earns its place. Rhythm modulates with discovery pulse—long lyrical lines yield to clipped bearings. One near-miss: “stranded luminance glowed in her mind” skirts abstraction, but immediate ledger action grounds it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hopscotch board as celestial chart, starlings as living astrolabe. Transformation test fails—story collapses without these exact elements. Risk in merging child’s game with astral navigation pays off; no genre clichés. Specificity of Old Marineri phrasebook and Solis Aeternus roots invention in lived detail. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
