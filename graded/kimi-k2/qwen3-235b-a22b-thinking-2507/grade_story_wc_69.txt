<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ms. Thorne’s interiority is textured—her tactile tracing of the rosette, the “expectantly resigned” stance, and the micro-choice to shift rehearsal from singing to silence all feel earned. The contradiction between her pride in past harmony and present despair is embodied rather than labeled. Cost is visible: she forfeits the immediate gratification of a quick fix for the slow labor of listening. Secondary characters remain off-stage, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final silence in the library is charged with earned resonance, the cost being weeks of fragile unlearning. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence increases until it reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One transition (library → auditorium → library) is within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The velvet library’s “autumnal gloom” and the rosette’s pearwood grain are selective, sensuous, and tied to choice: the library’s hush becomes the literal rehearsal space. Micro-setting (the rosette as acoustic tool) constrains the pedagogical tactic. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the choir’s capacity to listen—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each rehearsal subtracts internal noise, tightening the emotional vise until the final concert becomes the test. Cost is palpable: weeks of “fragile unlearning.” No coincidence resolves the rift; the shift is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the erosion of empathy framed as acoustic noise. The rosette’s function—creating resonance by subtraction—reappears as the governing metaphor without authorial nudge. Final silence offers a non-literal answer: harmony is the space cleared, not the notes added. No moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“dust motes danced… shelves bowed”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Ms. Thorne’s noticing is filtered through musical and tactile priorities. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style is clean; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse under pressure beats. Opening and closing lines are precise, the final image of sunlight on the rosette crystallizing prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The acoustic metaphor for social repair feels fresh; the rosette’s subtractive function is not a stock symbol. Transformation test: the story would collapse if the rosette were replaced by any generic token. Specificity of Sephardic/West-African/Appalachian braid resists cliché. Risk in choosing silence over song pays off.</comment>
