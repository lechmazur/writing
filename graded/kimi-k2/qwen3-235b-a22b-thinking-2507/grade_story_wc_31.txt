<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris is vivid, self-contradictory interiority (“color of sound” synesthesia versus job duty) anchors every choice; lantern warmth and salt-sting embody emotion. One flaw: grandmother’s riddle line skirts explanatory summary before the descent. Earned refusal of surface resolution at the end (creditable renunciation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grim causal lens holds: lantern hush ⇒ tide reveal ⇒ emerald note crystallizing sound = decisive change with visible conceptual cost (library immersion → heart-note vow). No causality bleed, lens stays Accumulative/Textural recognized early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sunken library micro-setting constrains movement (water level, ribs), charging every step. Specific details—brass ladder rungs oozing rust, algae-written phosphor letters—are filtered through POV synesthesia bias. Final lantern’s reflection pierces water column = closure image charged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: discover color of sound → luminous vow recharging the heart. One escalation: staying past tide’s turn locks option, visible frostbite cost in boots and soul-note. No slack pressure but complication kept compact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: “truth hides behind vow” through moments where letters glow as sailor promises made tangible sound visible—no thesis spoken aloud. Final choice (carry courage’s amber within) reweights hero’s emotional rule-set non-verbally.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is sensuous, spare, rhythmic (“oil wick… calloused fingers… meteor hush”). Synesthetic POV is stable; no head hopping. Compression under pressure: final sentence fuses sky lantern and tide sigh into charged poise without explanatory filler.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose tight: “lantern’s beam cutting through silt” propels; every clause does two jobs. No filter-verb clutter, loops absent. One minor scaffold: phrase “guided his movements deliberately” slightly redundant next to deliberate earlier; forgiven in rhythm.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthesia meets sailor promise ghosts turned into glowing algae script—story collapses if either premise removed. Metaphor that color must be earned through dark luminous vow is inevitable in hindsight. Risk cohesive quiet reveal that trusts image.</comment>
