<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bronze quill holder’s weight and notches anchor her lineage and tactical ingenuity. The moment she rotates the gnomon crystallizes her contradictory impulses—loyalty to post versus duty to revolution—with a tactile, irreversible cost. One slip from 9.0: the “calmly inventive” label is asserted rather than dramatized in that beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → opportunity → sundial deciphered → path to cradle. Closure lands as a Decisive Change—Elara now carries actionable coordinates—paid for by the risk of misalignment and permanent betrayal of her post. Cost is legible in the warm notches and her ghost-like vanishing into the dark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fort’s blackout is not mere backdrop; its swallowed glow forces Elara to rely on touch and faint city-glow, directly shaping how she reads the sundial. Micro-setting—the bronze tool against stone angles—functions as environment that constrains choice. Missing a 9.0 nudge: the cradle chamber itself remains off-stage, so the final image is charged by anticipation rather than place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution before dawn—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the blackout becomes the only window. One meaningful turn: the sundial click forecloses retreat; any mis-step now dooms the cells. Cost is the irreversible breach of her sworn duty, felt in the warm bronze and her vanishing act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silent resistance emerges through concrete mechanics—blackout, half-painted dial, weighted quill—rather than statement. Final image of a “ghost carrying fire” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: revolutions can whisper before they blaze. Slight abstraction in “cradle of sparks” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; phrases like “winking hush of the blackout” and “angles where light forgets to fall” teach the pattern early and pay off at closure. Compression and purposeful elision (“melted back into the shadows”) accelerate the final beat without clarity loss. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers atmosphere, stakes, or tactical detail. Figurative language is selective and coherent—“bruised purples,” “falling ash”—never clogging the high-pressure beat. One minor loop: “silent ally” / “silent revolution” echo could tighten, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The blackout-as-ally conceit, sundial cipher, and weighted quill key synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious heist-without-noise. Specificity of etched notches and half-painted geometry transforms familiar rebellion tropes. Risk-taking (entire plot hinging on geometric angles in darkness) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
