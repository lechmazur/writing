<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers tracing the bronze curve, the memory of C-sharp tension—but the seasonal muteness is asserted rather than dramatized as a live constraint. Motivation is clear and consistent, yet the final renunciation (her voice for the sculpture’s song) feels slightly pre-ordained rather than freshly compelled. Micro-choices are precise, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Heart Chime’s final note refracts wonder into the community’s bones while Elara’s throat tightens with the first muteness—cost is felt. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of glisten, color, and resonance tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is anchored early; no drift. One transition (sunset to snowfall) is seamless and reweights the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff is not backdrop but instrument: wind pressure, thin sun, and cloud sea constrain every tuning choice. Micro-setting (the Heart Chime’s lattice, the iceberg fragment’s prismatic tunnels) functions as setting-objects that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elara notices bronze signatures, not tourist vistas. Weather evolves causally from transition to snowfall, tightening the muteness clock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder via sonic translation—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying glisten and communal uptake. One meaningful deepening: the iceberg fragment’s internal stresses translate into audible truth, narrowing Elara’s remaining agency to surrendering her voice. Cost is visible—her throat tightens, silence begins. Coincidence (delivery of fragment) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between articulation and silence, wonder and loss, without moralizing. The final image of rainbows in bones reweights the premise: wonder survives as vibration, not pigment. Subtext operates in gesture—children’s silent laughter, elders’ swaying—rather than exposition. No thematic echo in dialogue; resonance is earned through sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “wind-scoured rock humming with the planet’s breath” teaches the pattern early and sustains it. Perceptual signature is Elara’s—she reads storms in bronze signatures, not meteorology. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer clauses during tuning, clipped fragments at muteness onset. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal monologue stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “a jagged shard of ancient sky-blue ice, still glistening despite the thin mountain sun” does triple duty (object, color, fragility). Rhythm varies naturally; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—ice as relic, wind as language. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “its glisten a promise against the gathering dark.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—seasonal muteness, wind-bell translation of truth—feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test fails: story collapses if muteness or kinetic sculpture is removed. Specificity anchors universals: polar vaults, C-sharp hope, apricot cloud sea. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off; no derivative echoes. Final reconfiguration (silence as preservation) is non-obvious and earned.</comment>
