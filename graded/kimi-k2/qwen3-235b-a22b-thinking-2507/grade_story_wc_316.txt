<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s numbness is embodied in the trembling jar and tears; the contradictory drive to feel again powers the climax. Kael’s corporate certainty collapses under on-page pressure, giving the relationship a crucible moment. The final micro-choice—cradling the jar—earns the thaw with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though “ego death survivor” is more label than lived texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the brain’s glow rewrites legal and emotional reality under a Causal lens. Each beat tightens because/therefore links—Kael’s demand → Aris’s block → vivification—until the custody claim dissolves. Cost is legible in Aris’s tears and Kael’s dropped waiver. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo and rewriting skyline create textured pressure that tilts the platform and mirrors inner flux. The brain jar serves as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Selective sensory detail—condensation freezing then boiling—charges the final image. A touch more spatial anchoring early would sharpen the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of a consciousness—tightens once when Aris turns Kael’s corporate claim into a question of personhood. Escalation is causal: each move narrows legal options until the waiver falls. The cost is the corporate certainty Kael forfeits and the emotional flood Aris accepts. One decisive tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the custody dispute reframed as the right to feel; no moralizing lines intrude. The complementary-opposites motif threads from master’s lesson to final embrace without overt statement. The ending reweights “duplicate” from property to person through image, not thesis. Subtext lives in Kael’s unsteady bow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature shows in “neon voids” and “prehistoric jungle.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—Kael’s surgical diction versus Aris’s whisper. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every image advances stakes or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in “history rewriting itself” refrain, but it serves pattern. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops in peak beats. Rhythm modulates with pressure, climaxing in the single-sentence flare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The clone-custody premise is familiar, yet the fusion of martial-arts philosophy with biotech personhood feels fresh. Risk-taking in the literal vivification through emotional void is bold and coherent. Specificity—condensation boiling, neon voids—grounds the speculative frame. The ending’s reweighting of “duplicate” is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
