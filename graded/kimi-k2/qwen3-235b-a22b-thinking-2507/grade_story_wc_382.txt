<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—hunger for literal meaning vs. acceptance of shared illusion—are dramatized in her tactile handling of the seal and the micro-choice to press it to her chest. Interiority is specific and embodied; grief surfaces through jasmine scent and cool obsidian rather than labels. The final renunciation of interrogation for listening is earned by prior causality and carries visible emotional cost. Minor slip: Mrs. Thorne’s status dynamics remain underused.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s realization reframes the entire quest under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the “language” from code to communion. Causality holds—every meteor, sip of tea, and Vale’s letter tightens the pattern until the final charged poise. Cost is legible in the line “Guard the silence between the lies.” No orientation debt; rooftop anchors arrive within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden’s jasmine, damp earth, and streaking meteors are filtered through Elara’s selective grief; the obsidian seal functions as micro-setting that constrains her final gesture. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—meteors flare like dying stars when realization hits. Spatial choreography is clean; the wicker chair creak anchors proximity. Environment does not merely backdrop but charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elara keep interrogating or accept the consoling fiction?—is signaled early and tightens once when Mrs. Thorne’s line “the lie was the language” forces a trade-off. Escalation is accumulative: each meteor, sip, and memory adds density until the final reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the burning eyes and the promise to “guard the silence.” No external reversals, but internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: shared fictions as shelter against loss. Subtext lives in gesture—the seal pressed to the chest, honey stirred slowly—never in exposition. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “the space where understanding and imagination met.” Ambiguity lingers but is coherent; the reader feels the cost of choosing illusion over interrogation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature shows in “stones hum in Dorian mode” and the synesthetic blend of jasmine and meteor light. Syntax modulates with emotional crests—long languid clauses give way to the clipped realization “Suddenly, she understood.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext; Mrs. Thorne’s diction is distinct from Elara’s interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple drift: “meteors streaked silver across the velvet sky” balances image and momentum. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—obsidian raven as both key and burden. Minor filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—learning to “read” buildings as language—could be twee, yet is transformed into a meditation on grief and consensual myth. Specificity of Vale’s Dorian stones and the grandmother’s demolished home grounds the concept. The meteor shower as cosmic punctuation is fresh without gimmickry. Risk-taking in quiet lyric closure pays off; the final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
