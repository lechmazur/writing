<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Anselm’s interiority is vivid—cassock vibration, indigo breath—but his contradictory impulses (faith vs. techno-ritual) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation (collective belief over stone permanence) is earned by the looped probe, yet the cost feels collective rather than personal, softening the sting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the thirteenth bell’s absence and the indigo smear crystallize the Resonant Reconfiguration—belief re-anchored. Causal chain (question → resonance → shared epiphany) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Minor waver: the townsfolk’s sudden “feeling” is off-page, slightly blurring agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>St. Aethelred’s is sketched with sensory economy—dust motes, flagstone cold, bell tolls—each filtering through Anselm’s urgency. The loop pedal and indigo palette function as micro-setting that literally constrain his tactics; the dimensional anchor’s groan is the final charged image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchor collapse) is signaled early and tightens via each bell toll. One decisive deepening: the rhetorical probe exposes the poisoned assumption, narrowing options from repair to revelation. Cost is felt in the “thinner, scarred” stillness, though the price is communal, not personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—faith as active, audible belief versus passive stone—emerges through the indigo silence and looping questions, never sermonized. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, letting the scarred stillness resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is ecclesiastical-technical (“dimensional anchor,” “Boss RC-300”) yet tactile; syntax tightens under pressure, mirroring the countdown. Compression and elision (“Time bled away”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“muffled clarity,” “conceptual repricing”) fits Anselm’s vocation yet skirts purple once or twice. Final line is crisp and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The techno-liturgical fusion—loop pedal exorcism, indigo silence as sacrament—feels inevitable and fresh. Risky conceit is fully committed, transforming genre tropes into lived ritual. Only the off-page townsfolk epiphany keeps it from absolute singularity.</comment>
