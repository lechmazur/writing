<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“turbine-hum reverie that vibrated deep in her ribs”), her motivation to scaffold chaos into simplicity is dramatized through the lantern-slide visions and the final choice to carve the spiral. The contradiction between fear and reverence is present but not fully simultaneous in scene; the cost is felt yet slightly generalized. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each slide vision layers density until the final image reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s stance crystallizes into “perpetually learning” with the spiral wood as tangible cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The turbine hum modulating into lullaby provides the cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway, salt-stung body, and lantern slide function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“waves clawed,” “oak bleached silver”). Spatial choreography is coherent; weather actively shapes action. The driftwood spiral at the end becomes the charged object that mirrors the arch, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform storm’s chaos into meaningful form—is signaled early and tightened when the slide reveals the driftwood arch vision. Agency is Mara’s decision to carry the spiral home; cost is the storm endured and the path foregone. Escalation is textural: each vision deepens the weave until the final reconfiguration. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges organically from fishermen, shipbuilders, and Mara’s own hands; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the spiral wood reweights the premise—destruction as renewal—without stating it. Subtext operates in the lantern’s silence after its “work done.” Complexity folded into simplicity feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with perceptual signature in driftwood grain read “like a language.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reverie, clipped fragments as she lifts the spiral. No POV slippage; diction stays within Mara’s artisan lexicon. The turbine-hum motif threads through as acoustic texture without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“turbine-hum reverie,” “time itself folded into its grain”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor elevated diction (“reverie,” “scaffolded”) fits the reflective drift, not jarring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—driftwood sculptor reads oceanic history through magic lantern slide—feels fresh and inevitable. Familiar storm/artist tropes are transformed via tactile specificity and the timewoven alliance concept. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final spiral image. No close echoes; synthesis is singular.</comment>
