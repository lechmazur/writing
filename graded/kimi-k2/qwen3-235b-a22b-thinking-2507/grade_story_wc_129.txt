<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—reed-bird work fused with body tension when Weaver is glimpsed—yet lines like “the ache flared, beautiful and sharp” teeter toward raw articulation. Her empathy seeds three key beats (Hemlock reveal, group tag hunt, arbor conception); edited opening would tighten micro-moments into unequivocal darkness and depth. She earns a lasting cost in renouncing solitude, so character integrity holds despite slight summary haste.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each discovered tag reorders emotional density rather than causal plot turns, culminating in a lushly resonant web that reframes “kinship” as collective labor. Escalation is a cadence shift—seven tags into one communal image—not a growing risk ladder, which suits this length. Closure lands with luminous, felt cost, satisfying Q2 demands.</comment>

<comment>Mosaic setting details—orchard light shards, obsidian rainbows—are vivid but mostly backdrop until the arbor recharges them for the final sculpture. The orchard’s prismatic reflections do subtly guide later lighting choices in the sculpture, meeting gate 3, yet remain decorative in more beats than they actively pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—belonging—tightens as each tag discovered removes another solitary option; the collective web crystallizes that refusal of isolationnow exacts visible vulnerability. No escalating external stakes, but pressure accumulates through group expectation; missed lower-conflict turns in middle third cap rating just under high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: each reclaimed tag literalizes “kinship” as craft, culminating in communal co-authorship of the sculpture. A final charged understatement—reed light dancing on every face—offers resonant, non-moralizing answer that re-weights solitude vs. connection. Ambiguity remains coherent without sermonizing.</comment>

<comment>Close Limited Third stays tight; free indirect “she understood then that Weaver knew her work” offers charged insight without head-hopping. Distinct texture: marsh-wet reeds, glass-cold arbor, absorbed light. The voice carries a soft yearning rhythm intensifying through F and S alliteration around “fragile bird… fractured light.”</comment>

<comment>Prose is compressed and musical: reeds “weave” “flicker” “pulse” in sounded, not said. One illicit adverbial overlay on “luminously yearned” is forgiven for cadence. Zero plagiaristic loops; only one minor synonym churn near “crater’s murmur.” High information density under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of the mysterious outsider by revealing “Weaver” as an emergent mosaic of communal acts—subtle, earned. Specific observation patterns—birds mirrored in tags—prevent generic mysticism; synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Risks lyric quietness but pays off with communal cost.</comment>
