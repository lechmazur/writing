<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—skepticism vs. reluctant belief—is embodied in the micro-choice to place the tile; the final renunciation of skepticism carries visible social cost when she risks ridicule to save the whales. The shift from “keeper of relics” to “witness” is earned through prior causality and felt cost. Minor slip: the mentor’s voice surfaces as convenient exposition rather than embodied memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: tile-touch triggers vision → knowledge of star-shift → decision to transcribe → village action. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara stands in the tower, no longer skeptic, with the whales’ course corrected and her social standing forever altered. Cost is legible in the villagers’ earlier skepticism and her raw voice at the wharf.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower, tile, and ocean are selective, sensory, and purposeful: salt spray on metal, obsidian constellations shimmering, sunrise catching the whale’s spout. These details constrain choices (tile must be placed on slate, tower height allows whale-sight) and charge the final image. No orientation debt; geography and time remain coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whales vs. shipping lanes—signaled early and tightened when star-shift is revealed. One meaningful turn: Elara chooses to risk credibility by sharing transcriptions, narrowing her future in the village. Cost is social and emotional; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies entanglement emerges through concrete events (vision of harpoon scars, dredging vibrations) rather than statement. Final image of tower as “space for repair” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in villagers’ slow nod carries more weight than any speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent: “bruised twilight,” “salt spray… mournful songs.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s—astronomer’s precision, skeptical diction, then softened awe. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“We’ll reroute the ships”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“living ink,” “memory-tide”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing”-like phrasing once, but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: whale-song as cosmic archive, star-shifts caused by dredging, magic square as interspecies memory key. Transformation test fails—plot could not survive relocation. Specificity of gray-whale migration and coastal dredging grounds the fantastical in lived detail.</comment>
