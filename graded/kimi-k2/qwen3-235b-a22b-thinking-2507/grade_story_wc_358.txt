<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied in the fogged respirator, the cold weight of the patch, the ache of the silent town—yet her contradictory impulse (scientific detachment vs. survivor’s guilt) is more summarized than dramatized in scene. The final vow to “make the invisible visible” is earned by the preceding data and near-miss with the shifting container, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the patch in her pocket becomes a charged promise, reweighting the entire survey from blame to prevention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each measurement thickens the pattern until the groaning container forces a recalibration—though the shift from data to vow could be one beat sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is not backdrop but antagonist: its geometry funnels wind, dislodges metal, and dictates every crouch and dodge. Micro-detail—rust flakes, thermal updrafts, groaning steel—constrains choice and charges the final image of empty cranes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent another ghost town—is signaled early and tightened when the container shifts, forcing Elara to add structural vulnerability to her report. The cost is visible: she nearly dies, recalibrates, and the vow carries the weight of that near-loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: foresight as moral debt to the dead. The patch and the empty cranes reweight the premise without sermonizing, though the final vow flirts with overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise yet atmospheric—“hazy precision” rendered in clipped, instrument-laden diction that mirrors an investigator’s mind. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, from anemometer flickers to the ache of silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor scaffold (“she noted,” “she documented”) and one mixed metaphor (“wind… amplified into a blade”) mar the flow. Density is high—each sentence advances data, danger, or memory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—fatal wind vortices born of container architecture—feels fresh, grounded in granular physics rather than disaster cliché. Risk lies in the quiet, data-driven arc; it pays off in the final vow, though the transformation is more conceptual than emotional.</comment>
