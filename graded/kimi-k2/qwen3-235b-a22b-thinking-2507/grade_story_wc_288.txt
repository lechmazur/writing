<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet fearing annihilation—are embodied in her scream until her throat bleeds and her final tear-streaked acceptance. Micro-choices (placing the sundial, pressing ear to stone) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The earned shift from isolation to resonant coexistence carries visible cost. Only the Aethon elders’ dissolution is summarized rather than dramatized, a minor slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hum transforms memory’s shattering force into sustainable resonance, foreclosing isolation. Causal chain holds—sundial placement → dawn light → memory surge → hum intervention → stance shift. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of sensory and emotional pattern reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the final image of tears and the hum’s quiet promise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal library’s coral shelves, lunar inkwells, and vibrating monoliths constrain every move; the brass sundial’s atomically reflective face literally directs the dawn light that triggers the climax. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—cold glass, warm brass, subsonic hum in molars—anchoring POV bias. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room syndrome. Environment charges the final image as clouds part to reveal a shared world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence without shattering—signaled early. One decisive tightening: the dawn light strikes, memory threatens madness, the hum offers only coexistence, not erasure. Agency drives escalation: Elara aligns the sundial, chooses to endure the memory under the hum’s modulation. Cost is visceral—tears, throat blood, and the irreversible acceptance of dual legacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: carrying extinction’s memory without being consumed. Subtext in gesture—tracing condensation, pressing ear to stone—speaks louder than any thesis. Final image of clouds parting offers non-literal answer: independence is resonance, not forgetting. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the hum’s quiet promise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure: “shards of ice in her blood,” “gravitational sigh.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s—selective attention to light, vibration, tidal pulse. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as memory surges. Experimental compression (“brittle awakenings”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—no purple drift. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct species’ harmonic technology repurposed as grief technology. Tidal library above cloud-sea, coral shelves, atomically reflective sundial—specific, non-generic worldbuilding. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence and heightens stakes. Transformation test fails if names change; premise is inseparable from execution.</comment>
