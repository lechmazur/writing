<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaito’s interiority is textured—potter’s muscle memory, zen breathing, tactile glass warmth—yet the final renunciation (carrying the shard away) feels slightly under-motivated; no prior beat shows him abandoning the kiln quest. Embodied emotion is strong, but the cost of leaving the oasis is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (dust, thrum, lavender, glass warmth) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—lantern glass now “generating” light—whose conceptual cost (he forsakes restoring the oasis) is legible in the last two sentences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is rendered through micro-setting—cracked clay hives, brittle sage, single lavender bloom—each detail constraining Kaito’s kneeling, cupping, stone offering. Final image of curling smoke re-anchors time and recharges the scorched horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—“why some places resist change”—tightens when the glass reveals kindness as the resisting force; the deepening is the recognition that resistance is daily choice, not reversal. Cost is the quiet forfeiture of restoring the oasis now, carried in his palm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: kindness as phototropic light that bends time. The lantern glass’s final glow reweights every prior image without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—wasteland remains—yet the emotional aftereffect is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, rhythmically controlled; long sentences breathe with zen pacing, then compress under the thrum. Perceptual signature is consistent—dust on palms, warmth of glass—no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers texture without clutter. Only minor loop: “thrum” repeated four times in close succession, but the pattern is taught early and serves as heartbeat.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic beekeeper’s lantern as time-anchor, phototropic kindness as physics. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration; no derivative echoes.</comment>
