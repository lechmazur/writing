<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses—stubborn persistence vs need for reconciliation—play out in embodied tension (quartz eye vs tear); micro-choice to re-purpose the ribbon is costly, turning keepsake into lifeline with no back-pedal. Liora’s re-entry reads credibly via inherited feistiness, a reversal made inevitable by the grandmother–mother–child genealogy that had previously broken. Interiority stays specific and sensory rather than therapeutic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/texture lens: incremental grafting of shards parallels the emotional mosaic, tightening each knot until the orchard’s respiration and stained glass re-weight each other. Closure—Liora’s arrival with sapling—is a resonant reconfiguration: vows live not in documents but in living cuts and shared sky. On-page cost: Elara surrenders the last material proof of Liora (ribbon) to repair the window, a foregone memory turned structural ligament.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cracked gothic ribcage overgrown with edible canopy provides one continuous spatial pressure; ladder and glass shards dictate reachable angles, orchard breeze actually dislodges blossom that lands on mended cobalt, charging final image. Cathedral’s ruined skeleton acts as micro-setting tool, constraining every physical reach and symbolic leap required to finish the repair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—can an inter-generational vow survive bureaucratic betrayal—tightens each time Elara’s supply line fails; ribbon swap creates one credible reversal that reweights risk (sacrifices keepsake for structural integrity). Cost measured in irreplaceable silk and uncertain reunion; no off-stage rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal emerges from concrete particulars: glass fractures echo branch grafts, ribbon weave mirrors orchard forks. Final picture—blue silk sky holding cracked sapling—repackages abstract inheritance into living assembly without lecturing. No moralizing; resonance arises from action, image, and withheld embrace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Controlled lyric free-indirect style, tactile specificity (“her quartz eye catching how the ribbon’s weave echoed the orchard’s branching”), no head-hop. Rhythm accelerates during threading then breathes at reunion; Liora’s speech is terse, believable after eighteen-year silence. Accumulative diction serves final crystallization without self-indulgence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High density—“leaves must fall to nourish new growth” arrives via lived pruning session, not axiom; no loops or scaffold sentences. Sentence length modulates with physical strain; final paragraph lands clean, no clutter. Minor elevated diction at “conceptual cost” occurs only once and fits contemplative beat after silence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “reconciliation in ruined cathedral” is transformed by grafting of orchard into roofline and literal grafting of inherited hair-silk into holy window; specificity of quartz-eye craft and deciduous vow law converts trope into irreplicable event. Fresh inflection: ribbon as structural ligature—hair becoming mortar—carries both intimacy and engineering surprise.</comment>
