<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—desperate hope vs. practiced jocularity—are embodied in the cracked spectacles and the moon-rock thumb-rub; his final renunciation of the “cure” for the circle of reciprocity is earned and carries visible cost in the softened voice and communal laughter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rumor chain catalyzes communal action, and Aris’s realization that “the cure is mostly just showing up” reweights the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the relinquished fantasy of a solitary fix.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is tactile and lived-in—ivy rustles, tools clink, biscuits are shared—constraining movement and shaping the communal economy; the moon rock itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness vs. connection—tightens when each rumor lead dissolves, forcing Aris to confront the real currency of reciprocity; the final card-dealing beat crystallizes the trade-off with felt communal warmth replacing the solitary quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: connection as mutual exchange rather than extracted cure. The moon rock’s reweighting from burden to reminder, and the rumor chain’s transformation from false promise to true catalyst, offer a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—wry, exhausted, precise; “polite anarchy” and “terrible jokes” carry subtext; compression and patterned elision (“Call it hazard pay…”) are taught early and paid off in the softened final announcement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sensory detail is selective (“ivy reclaiming… broken windows”), metaphors fresh, no loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, culminating in the quiet cadence of the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-disaster barter-station, moon-rock loneliness, and rumor-chain alchemy feels fresh; the inversion of “cure” from potion to communal presence is earned and specific to this world.</comment>
