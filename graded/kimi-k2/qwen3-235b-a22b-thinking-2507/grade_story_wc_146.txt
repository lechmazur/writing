<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority stays present—her palms against cold fork, her listening posture—but internal contradiction is only implied rather than embodied in real-time tension. The stance of infinite patience is dramatized through footstep cadence and gentle touch rather than stated. No diagnostic self-help voices intrude; cost is the slowed tempo she must bear. Closure is renunciation of haste itself, earned in visible collective gait.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: the town pulses again in the cobblestones, hush now charged, collapse forestalled. Cause chain: fork reading → demonstration → resonance tightening → dust settling shows each step builds the next in causal linkage. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of footfall re-tensions the setting. Felt cost is the measured time of walking, no swifter escape available.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Anchorings are immediate: crumbling sandstone archway stands within two sentences. Atmosphere is all desiccated grit and twilight bruise, filtered through Elara’s narrowed miner/mercant memory. The archway directly braces the final image—keystone aligned by sonic back-vibration. Sensory choice supports not tourist gaze but resonant tool-work.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear by line 8: the town will collapse unless shared foot-rhythm is restored. Escalation is accretive: fork’s first dull echo, then strengthening resonance, then dust releasing as stones find alignment. Single tightening costs the forced slow walk—Finn must give up sprinting, Mara abandon wary retreat. Stakes remain concrete: every step either mends or allows next crumble.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of communal resonance under greed emerges solely from tactile procession and echo shift. No editorial remark is ever delivered; the final image of fork tone blending with footfall reframes the premise without speech. Land acknowledgement is present: greed-haste fractured harmony; recovery must be paced, not raced. No abstract homily replaces bodily action.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, mineral, lightly archaic without pretension: “dense, cool ebony,” “parched earth starving for true sound.” Rhythm lengthens under pressure: the step-pause-step cadence is felt in prose syncopation. POV remains close third on Elara; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but cadence-adjusted: “step... pause... step... pause...” spoken as vibration itself.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Each sentence performs multi-duty: “pure, unwavering tone cutting through deceptive quiet” both paints scene and foreshadows cure mechanic. Occasional slight overwriting—“brittle, unsustainable pulse”—but occurs outside closure beats, so only −0.2. Final paragraph avoids loops: no paraphrase of prior paragraph. Line rhythm accelerates then steadies to mirror gait.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sonic rebuild via footstep metronome is fresh; mineshaft or fireside ghost stories would have been safer. Specificity of sandstone arch keystone vibrating gives the trope flesh. Fork and pacing method feel inseparable: replace fork with generic bell, logic frays. Risk bold and paid off: quiet, collective repair feels inevitable in hindsight.</question>
