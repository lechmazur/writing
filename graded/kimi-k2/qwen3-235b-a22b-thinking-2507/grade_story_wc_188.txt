<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt and need for defiance are embodied in micro-choices—picking up the rag, lighting the single match—each carrying visible cost. The shift from “Step. Breathe. See.” to “Step. Breathe. Create.” crystallizes earned change without tidy redemption. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. One more beat of contradictory impulse mid-scene would have pushed this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tiny flame reconfigures despair into quiet resistance, cost felt in the spent match and lingering kerosene stink. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer tightens the emotional vise until the mosaic’s glass shards catch the fire. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3. One causal hiccup: the spinner’s rag appears conveniently, but its later reprise justifies the coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Veridian Spire’s living architecture constrains movement—thorned vines, crushed petals underfoot—and supplies the dry basin where the final flame is held. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: jasmine scent thickens guilt, mosaic tiles cool under fingertips. Micro-setting (the rag, the basin) functions as setting-objects that shape the final choice. A hairline slip: “ink-black sky” edges cliché, but the starless void is reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defy crushing hopelessness—is signaled early and tightened by each sensory beat. The mosaic’s declaration forces a micro-turn: passive observation becomes active creation. Cost is visible in the spent match and the risk of repeating past tragedy. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: discarded artistry, broken tiles reassembled, a single flame answering starless dark. No moralizing; the final image reweights “Hope is the first spark” from slogan to lived stance. Subtext in the rag’s reek and the mosaic’s glass shards carries the emotional aftereffect. One whisper of thematic echo in the final line, but it feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, syntax tightening with each repetition of the chant. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices “tremor in a moth’s wing,” filters scent as “thick as velvet.” No POV leakage; compression and elision are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity without drumbeat monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors, no purple overload. Minor scaffold in “thick as velvet” but it serves POV. Zero loops or synonym churn; high information density maintained to the final ember.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms familiar grief-recovery arc through living architecture and micro-ritual of fire. The rag’s reprise and mosaic’s glass shards feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of “comet cascade” and “thorned vines” anchors universals. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
