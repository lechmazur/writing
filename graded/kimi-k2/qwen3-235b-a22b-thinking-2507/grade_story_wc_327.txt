<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—hope vs. the curse—drives every micro-choice; the moment he presses palm to bone and wills texture into hum embodies motive. The final renunciation (carrying the sonic imprint after the diamond dies) is earned and costly. Yet the elders’ tale about starlings arrives as convenient exposition rather than dramatized memory, blunting the flaw-compulsion link.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the texture-sound survives the diamond’s death, reweighting Kael’s lifelong stake. Causal chain holds—diamond taken → tunnel test → starling dance → fracture → earned memory—under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors (canyon, tunnel, bone tower) are clear by line 3. Only a whisper of lens ambiguity at the starling lore beat keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and porous stone are not backdrop; their texture is the very thing Kael must translate, constraining his method and charging the final sonic imprint. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—copper-veined skin, dusty light, rough holes—integrated into action. The canyon’s echo physics remain consistent, guiding choice. Minor over-description (“skeletal hand clawing at the sky”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the dying Echo Tongue via texture-sound—is signaled early and tightened once: the diamond’s flaw threatens total failure, then the crack confirms the curse. Escalation is textural: each echo layer intensifies until the final silence. The cost (loss of the diamond, permanence of one translated texture) is legible. Coincidence of starlings is allowed to complicate, not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language death versus embodied memory. The flawed diamond’s failure and the lingering sonic imprint reweight the premise—imperfection may be the only honest vessel. No moralizing; resonance arises from the texture-sound surviving its instrument. The elders’ tale, though expositional, seeds the final reprise without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “skin traced with fine copper-veined lines” is perception filtered through sacred duty. Syntax breathes with pressure—long sentence for canyon sweep, clipped fragments during the crack. No head-hop; unreliability is not attempted. Only a single register drift (“liquid thought”) momentarily jars.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motive. Metaphors are precise—“symphony of whispers trapped in time.” No loops or scaffold; information multi-tasks. One mixed metaphor (“dance written in the sky”) is minor. Rhythm accelerates into the final crack, then falls into resonant silence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—using starling murmuration as acoustic control to translate stone texture into dying language—is fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. The flawed diamond as cursed recorder reconfigures a familiar trope. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors the concept.</comment>
