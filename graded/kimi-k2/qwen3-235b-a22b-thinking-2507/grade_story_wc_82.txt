<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, scalding tears, knuckles whitening on the cloth—yet the “fold grief into cranes” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final crane becomes hope. The micro-choice to keep polishing despite psychic agony crystallizes her hierarchy of values and earns the ending’s cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s lavender pulse reweights the basilica’s static grief into living solace, and the cost—her soul still dragging earthward—is legible in the final line “Another climb began again.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each ascent adds density until the pattern breaks into light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating island, glass basilica, and tea garden are rendered in jade-mist, plum-blossom specificity that filters through Elara’s selective grief. The lantern itself becomes micro-setting, constraining her final placement and charging the last image; only the cranes remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform Kael’s last dream into bearable light—tightens once: the geode resists, the dream wounds, yet she persists. The cost is visceral (sobs, scalding tears) and persistent (soul dragging), narrowing her future to endless climbs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of love/loss as single spectrum emerges through the basilica’s luminous torment and the lantern’s final pulse; no moralizing, only the reweighted image of plum-blossom-buffered shadow. The ending’s non-literal answer—“rising through the pain”—resonates without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“creased grief into the next crane,” “light felt like knives”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates under pressure. No POV drift; perceptual signature stays rooted in Elara’s craft-trained attention to texture and light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“liquid gold knives”) risk overwriting yet serve the luminous torment tone. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Final third remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami grief + dream-geode alchemy + floating glass basilica feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The “descends while ascending” paradox is embodied in the climb, not merely stated. Risky lyric intensity pays off in closure.</comment>
