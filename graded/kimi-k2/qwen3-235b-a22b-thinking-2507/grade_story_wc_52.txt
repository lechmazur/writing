<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The widow’s interiority is embodied in the weight of the ash blank and the first cut; her contradictory need to both keep and release Elias drives the carving. Micro-choice—setting the knife to wood—forecloses avoidance and costs the tear that lands on the shavings. Motivation is rooted in grief yet practical, avoiding therapy-speak. The arc from raw absence to shaped memory is earned and visible in the emerging figure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rain, kettle, wood grain) thickens until the first cut ruptures the stasis. Closure is a Charged Poise—the rough figure holds both presence and loss, the cost paid in the tear and the irreversible stroke. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. The final image crystallizes time without explaining it away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The loft’s rust-hued light and rain-beaded skylight are not backdrop; they narrow perception to the blank in her lap and later refract in the tear. Micro-setting (ash blank as “setting”) constrains her posture and choice: she can either grip or release it. Sensory hierarchy is widow-biased—sawdust scent over kettle steam—guiding attention to Elias’s absence. Weather and interior light evolve with her emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform unbearable absence into bearable form. Pressure escalates as crystallized time thickens; the kettle’s rising whistle and the blank’s unyielding weight tighten the moment until the knife descends. The single decisive act—first cut—costs the tear and commits her to the irreversible path. No external antagonist needed; grief itself is the coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “here and gone” emerges through the carving process: Elias is both in the grain and beyond it. Subtext lives in the silence between kettle whistle and rain tap, in the tear that salts the wood. Final image—rough figure held close—reweights loss as ongoing creation rather than erasure. No moralizing; resonance arises from tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, grief-filtered: “liquid pearls,” “ash wood blank felt heavy with his absence.” Syntax slows under pressure—long clauses mimic held breath—then tightens at the cut. No dialogue, yet the remembered rumble of Elias’s voice is woven into perception. Consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers scent, light, and texture without redundancy. Figurative language is selective—“rust-hued peace,” “shavings curled away like memories”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; the kettle whistle and rain maintain rhythmic counterpoint. Clean grammar; pronoun references unambiguous.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The widow-carver trope is refreshed by the circus widow’s specific grief-tool: lion musk on a jacket, scarred hands remembered in grain. Crystallized time as method is lyric yet grounded in the kettle’s live countdown. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative arc; it pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
