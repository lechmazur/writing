<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—data purity vs. covert intervention—is embodied in the micro-choice to encode the warning in weather symbols; the cost of unlocked gate and compromised solitude is felt. Curiosity is credibly particular: she spots indigo dye, cross-references pressure. Motivation escalates from self-protection to zone stewardship without epiphany overload.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: “BREACH” triggers lateral decoding which triggers coded reply which triggers unlocked gate. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses pure isolation with visible cost (gate left open). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Courtyard dusk is not postcard: the mosaic path literally shapes her lateral thinking; the anemometer’s brass coolness is handled again at closure, recharging the motif of measured calm yielding to risk. Micro-setting (sundial, dye smudge) constrains decoding choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve quarantine integrity—tightens once: from passive recording to active misdirection. Cost is explicit: solitude breached, gate unlocked. Escalation driven by her encoding decision; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of integrity-through-subtle-action emerges from concrete choices (encoding, unlocking) rather than statement. Final image of unlocked gate reweights solitude as stewardship; ambiguity lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: meteorological lexicon fused with tactile precision (“brass cool under her fingers”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during pigeon arrival, longer reflective cadence at end. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Figurative language sparse and purposeful (“lavender and ash” sets mood without overwriting). High information density: dye smudge, pressure reading, wind symbol all multitask.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm recorder as covert signal engineer within quarantine noir. Lateral thinking mechanic feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky quiet ending lands because prior motifs recharge.</comment>
