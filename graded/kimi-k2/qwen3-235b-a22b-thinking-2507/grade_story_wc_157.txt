<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—“stand guard over that inner spark”—is clear and embodied through micro-choices (planting the gourd, pocketing the seed). Interiority is specific: “rogue’s grin finally touching his lips” vs. “focused intensity.” The final endurance earns its cost when the Harmonizer pulse meets the garden’s counter-frequency and the spark “held.” Minor slip: Elara’s status/relationship pressure is under-used.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore (cipher → garden → jammer). Closure is a Decisive Change: the garden’s resonance disrupts the census, visible in the drone’s “momentarily confused” scan. Cost is felt—the Harmonizer still pulses, the rebellion remains fragile. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse steam, drone chrome, soil coolness—all tactile and filtered through Aris’s urgency. The gourd rattle seed itself becomes micro-setting, constraining tactics by its internal seed geometry. Selective sensory focus (humid air, scanning light) tightens with pressure. One anachronistic leap—“Harmonizers warming up” heard city-wide—barely grazes credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve unmonetized thought—signaled early. Escalation is one clear tightening: from merely planting coordinates to weaponizing the garden as jammer. The Harmonizer countdown provides live clock pressure. Cost is on-page: the garden’s hum is “subtle dissonance,” a fragile victory under ongoing surveillance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: resistance through cultivation, not speech. The final image—child’s “too free” laugh—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext runs through silence: no manifestos, only marigolds and gourds. Avoids tidy binaries; the regime still looms, the spark merely “held.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, slightly archaic yet urgent: “candidly cryptic,” “geometry of resistance.” Compression is taught early (“They tax sorrow now, Elara”) and paid off in the final rattle heartbeat. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Aris. Dialogue sparse but purposeful; Elara’s single spoken beat carries subtext about “convergence accelerating.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive: “chrome drones…hummed their ceaseless tax audits.” Metaphors are controlled; no mixed vehicles. One minor loop: “spark” appears three times in closing paragraph without new charge. Otherwise zero scaffold, high density. Final line—“the spark held”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: horticulture as encryption, gourd acoustics as cyber-jammer. Transforms familiar dystopia into lived specificity. Risk-taking (planting as hacking) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; the Lumina Club’s seed-cipher feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor deduction for Harmonizer tech left generic.</comment>
