<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—defiance against erasure and reverence for broken data—play out in embodied micro-choices (ink tracing, heartbeat counting). The final acceptance of corrupted segments as valid knowledge is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she remains alone, heartbeat 112, the price of insight. Interiority is concrete and character-specific; no stock phrasing. The death-certificate error survivor label is dramatized, not merely stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the digital ghost dissolves into usable pulsar data, reframing failure as bridge. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—ink spirals, heartbeat counts, and static fragments accrete until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the final line: “alive in the snow,” solitude intact. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The opal observatory under snow is not postcard backdrop; its muffled silence and luminous walls constrain every action and charge the final image. Micro-setting of porcelain shard and ink pool function as tactile extensions of setting. Environment guides choice: snow burial forces isolation, opal glow shapes perception. Weather and architecture evolve with events; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—extract wisdom from failure—tightens through each beat: static misread as death, ink spiral as map, ghost as revenant data. One meaningful deepening: accepting corrupted segments narrows future options (she will send the data but stay alone). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Cost is felt in solitude and bodily risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: failure as refraction, not end. Subtext operates in ink nebulae and heartbeat sync with cosmic pulse. Final image—“alive in the snow”—reweights premise without moralizing. No motif checklist; opal, shard, and static recur only as they constrain choice. Wisdom is earned through specific struggle, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“frost-fringed,” “luminous green-blue”). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elara notices ink patterns like nebulae, counts heartbeats as defiance. No head-hopping; POV stable. Compression taught early (“static had settled like fresh powder”) and paid off at closure. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—ink nebulae, opal constellations—never muddled. No loops or scaffold. Syntax varies naturally; paragraph cuts are clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motifs. Zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic death glitch + cosmic static + ink divination. Tropes transformed through grounded specifics (porcelain shard stylus, heartbeat-timed pulsar). Risk-taking in lyric-scientific fusion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable. No derivative premise; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
