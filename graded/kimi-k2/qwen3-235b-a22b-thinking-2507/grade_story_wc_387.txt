<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji’s interiority is vivid and embodied—calloused fingers, breath catching, resonance in bones—yet the final renunciation (brewing tea as ritual, not drink) is foreshadowed only by abstract reverence; the cost is felt but not dramatized as a concrete forfeiture, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the whistle-driven resonance reveals the fortress’s “silent song,” reweighting Kenji’s stance toward hidden labor. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each droplet, firefly, and whisk rotation layers density until the final image crystallizes with quiet cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The parapet’s wet grooves, moonlit bamboo whisk, and vibrating stone are not backdrop but instrument: they constrain how Kenji tests the pattern and supply the harmonic medium that charges the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, anchoring every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—appreciation of hidden effort—tightens when the whistle transforms observation into participatory resonance; the cost is the irrevocable shift from spectator to witness. One clear intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the unseen labor of rain, stone, and insect mirrors the net-mender’s vanished hours. Final image of swirling tea-froth offers non-literal answer—attention as sacrament—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, and philosophically inclined without slipping into lecture; diction (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”) is character-bound and rhythmically controlled. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; figurative language is disciplined, never clogging high-pressure beats. Minor scaffold (“hidden effort” repeated thrice) nudges down from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of net-mending, tea ritual, and fortress harmonics feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope is left untransformed. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
