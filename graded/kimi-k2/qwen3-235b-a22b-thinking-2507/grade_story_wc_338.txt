<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—skepticism vs. openness—play out in micro-choices (threading reels, brushing ivy). The final renunciation of “mending borders” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her tears and the vault’s breathing. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the henge’s song re-opens, re-weighting decades of silence. Causal chain (1952 light → root-blocked fissure → clearing → rain → resonance) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image—“stones sang on.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault, cracked frescoes, and sapling-choked altar are selective, sensory, and constrain every choice. The fissure itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the chapel’s whisper—tightens once when clearing the fissure risks damaging fragile roots. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (rain) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the vault’s “weeping” frescoes and Elara’s tear-streaked face.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-map emerges organically from Elara’s method and the stones’ withheld song. Final note “Silence is not absence” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in cracked saints’ pointing fingers and sapling’s mute leaves deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—map-framer’s eye for “minute shifts in shadow and texture.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical cadences in vault, clipped precision during reel comparison. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“subterranean echoes”) fits Elara’s scholarly lens. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: silent Super 8 reels as archaeological stethoscopes. Whispered chapel reimagined as harmonic fissure rather than ruin. Specificity of 1952 vs. yesterday footage makes trope inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
