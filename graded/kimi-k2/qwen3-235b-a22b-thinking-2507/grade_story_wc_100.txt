<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s undertaker identity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing the crack, repurposing burial tools for lens repair—yet the interior contradiction (rest for others vs. deferred rest for self) is only asserted, not dramatized in a single beat. The final renunciation of personal rest is credible but arrives as summary rather than a charged moment of cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the revitalized beam reweights the entire drowned archive from distress to vigil, with the cost of Silas’s perpetual return legible in the last line. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the prism reconfigures the city’s sorrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library’s silted shelves and bioluminescent plankton are filtered through Silas’s professional gaze, constraining his improvised repair tactics. The setting’s pressure—crushing dark, salt-seep—directly shapes the climax where the beam stakes its claim, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—granting rest to the drowned—tightens once when Silas chooses to transform the flaw into a prism, trading his own rest for theirs. The cost is felt but not viscerally embodied in a single decisive beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the ethics of tending unburied grief versus self-erasure. The final image of the lens holding “the deep’s quiet” reconfigures the motif of rest without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is grave, salt-crusted, with rhythmic control that mirrors rising pressure—“the water pressing in, the bell a fragile bubble”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature remains that of a man who measures life in coffin lengths.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“spectral jellyfish” of manuscripts—never clogging the descent or repair beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Undertaker restoring a drowned lighthouse-library via bioluminescent fracture is a fresh synthesis; the concept commits fully, avoiding stock tropes of ghostly redemption.</comment>
