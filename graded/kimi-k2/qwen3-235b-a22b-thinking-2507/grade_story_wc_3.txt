<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is precise and embodied—his “worn smooth” fingers, the “aching recognition” in tears—yet the final renunciation (accepting he can never cross the experiential gap) is felt rather than dramatized in a single decisive beat, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s new hum crystallizes both success and loss. The causal chain—tablet symbol → seed alignment → magnetic shift—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens, and the cost (proximity without union) is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor’s levitating field and crystalline leaves are not mere backdrop; they supply the very harmonic resource Aris manipulates, and the seed’s final glow recharges the setting itself, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens once: from solitary grief to the single experiment that proves Elara’s theory but forecloses reunion. The cost is legible—he gains knowledge yet forfeits presence—though the escalation is a single pulse rather than a progressive climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of transition as resonance—not rupture—emerges organically from the arbor’s hum and the seed’s flare. The final image of fingertips on glass offers a non-literal answer to “what is the physics of transition” without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is scholarly yet tender, with a perceptual signature that favors tactile precision (“cool glass casing,” “weathered cheeks”). The lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence, no head-hop or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, image, and concept. A few near-abstract phrases (“relentless scholar’s itch”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or blur the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Sumerian cuneiform, magnetic resonance, and post-death physics feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk of equating mythic descent with quantum transition is fully committed to and pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
