<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—his desire to “excavate sorrow” versus his need to carry hope—drives every micro-choice; the moment he smooths the negative against his palm embodies the cost of bearing witness. The shift from mapping acoustics to mapping redemption is earned by prior beats and forecloses the path of mere cataloguing. Flaws (sensitive perception as both gift and burden) complicate tactics under pressure. Only a slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis in the penultimate paragraph keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the film negative becomes a “compass,” reconfiguring Elias’s mission from mourning to rebuilding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo thickens the emotional density until the final cadence shift. Causality is intact: the discovery of the diaries → the glimpse → the resolve. Cost is visible in the phrase “the feverish heat outside,” a persistent constraint that will punish his new path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is not backdrop but instrument: its vibrations feed the resonator, its soot stains Elias’s fingers, its weak light makes the negative legible. Micro-setting (the brass resonator, the hearth’s ash) constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—damp earth over sight. Only a touch of static cataloguing (“skeletal trees”) prevents 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the walls’ dreams can still compel action—tightens once: the glimpse proves the dreams are human regrets, forcing Elias to shift from witness to messenger. Pressure grows accumulatively; each echo adds weight until the final thrum. Cost is felt in the “feverish heat,” a physical price for carrying the legacy. Agency drives the turn; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the negative’s reprise: legacy’s burden is not guilt but unfinished duty. Subtext operates in the silent vibration of stone and the hesitation before burning. The ending offers a non-literal answer—walls dream of “the courage to begin again”—without sermon. Only a faint thematic echo in “spiritual fracture” nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, weathered, and acoustically precise: “skittering of lizards,” “moss-slick walls.” Perceptual signature stays consistent under stress; no head-hop. Syntax breathes with pressure—long clauses in discovery, clipped fragments at the turn. One register drift into “spiritual fracture” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double work (“soot clinging like a permanent bruise”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates naturally. One mixed metaphor (“tomb of ash and broken pottery”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” as vocation, the negative as preserved hope, and the climatologist’s diaries fuse into a fresh synthesis of cli-fi and hauntology. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; no template echo. Risk in lyric density pays off in closure clarity.</comment>
