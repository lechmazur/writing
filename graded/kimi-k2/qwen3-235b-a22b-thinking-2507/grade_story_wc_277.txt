<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses—corporate caution vs. journalistic courage—play out in real time through her micro-choice to uncap the pen and phone Ben. The embodied cost is the click that “echoed…like a starting pistol,” foreclosing her silence. Interiority is specific, e.g., the phrase “reckless idealism” tasting “like ash.” Minor slip: “devotedly observant” is asserted rather than dramatized until the proof sketch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Ben’s call triggers Clara’s retreat → telescope scrutiny → chronometer check → proof by contradiction → decisive call. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: she ends her complicity and breaks the “orbit of regret.” No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by word 60. Chronometer and pen act as persistent constraints shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory’s glass floor, brass telescope, and atomic chronometer are tactile, selective, and tied to stakes: the chronometer’s glow “calibrated every camera.” Cloud-sea and pulsing stars mirror internal regret without overt symbolism. One spatial hiccup: “rosewood pen nib…in her pocket” feels unmotivated until she uncaps it, but the object later constrains choice, so cap stays high.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clear her father’s legacy or let truth die—tightens via the alibi contradiction. Agency: her proof sketch narrows options to one path, forcing the call. Cost is the irrevocable break with past silence. Escalation is causal and single-turn, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. legacy emerges organically from the alibi paradox and her decision to publish logs. Subtext in the pen’s warmth and the satellite’s “man-made truth” reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of the satellite “set free” offers a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly elevated diction fitting an heiress trained in nuance: “shaded nuance,” “obsidian shard.” Rhythm modulates under pressure—short declaratives during proof, longer lyric lines in reflection. No POV leakage; sensory filter is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but natural: “publish the chronometer logs…” advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled: “satellite trapped in decaying orbit” is apt and paid off. One near-miss: “solemn playfulness flickered” is slightly abstract, but context rescues it. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical precision as journalistic ethics, regret literalized as orbital decay. The chronometer-as-truth-engine and pen-as-anchor are non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk in compressed proof scene pays off without gimmickry. Minor deduction for familiar “inherit the sins of the father” frame, but specificity elevates it.</comment>
