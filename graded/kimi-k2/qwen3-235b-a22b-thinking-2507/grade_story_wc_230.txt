<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—rational detachment vs. desperate need for psychic quiet—drives every beat; the glass-eye choice crystallizes her hierarchy of values (self-protection > communal comfort) with visible cost to Hemlock. Embodied emotion (“pressure build behind her own eyes”) grounds the abstract stakes. Minor slip: “psychological safety” flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is quickly re-embodied in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the premise—truth as the only viable safety—while the glass eye’s chill literalizes the cost. Causal chain holds: truffle → eye → occlusion → compelled confession → Hemlock’s collapse. One transition (discovery to application) is seamless. No orientation debt; ravine and stakes are anchored within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard’s storm-scoured cliffs and perpetual damp constrain access and mood; the glass eye and truffle function as micro-setting that alters neural options. Sensory hierarchy (cold earth, churning river) filters through Elara’s utilitarian gaze. Final image—“ravine wind sighed”—recharges the opening damp with new moral weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elara mute unbearable empathy without moral erasure?—tightens once: occlusion succeeds but amplifies truth compulsion, forcing Hemlock’s collapse. Cost is legible in Hemlock’s tears and Elara’s recognition that safety is not silence. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (finding the eye) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the fracture of post-Virus society demands a new ethic of unshielded truth. Subtext in Hemlock’s silent grief and Elara’s reluctant confession carries the weight. Final image—“grace in fracture”—reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic drift; every detail serves the question of how to live with unfiltered perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, scientific-lyric (“tuber melanosporum,” “psychic bleed”) yet tactile; perceptual signature is unmistakably Elara’s. Syntax tightens under pressure: short declaratives during occlusion, longer reflective cadences after. No POV leakage; Hemlock’s interior is shown only through Elara’s constrained truth-telling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is selective (“orchard held its breath”) and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold; no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene heat; final paragraph achieves Charged Poise through controlled cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-empathy dystopia meets baroque neural folklore via truffle medicine and ocular prosthetics. The glass eye’s re-purposing feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of black truffle chemistry and banned Codex avoids generic tropes. Risky ethical stance—truth as the only safety—lands without didacticism.</comment>
