<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s nostalgia is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling, recalling the tear, cradling the seed-roses—yet the interior contradiction between caretaker protocol and emergent self-preservation could be sharper under final pressure. The flaw-as-compass beat lands with cost, but the emotional layering feels slightly compressed for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: magnetic shift → dome cracks → miniaturize → burn escape. Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the empty box and seed-roses reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost as the dome implodes behind him. One hairline slip—miniaturization physics is asserted rather than seeded—but the image reweights all prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Desert rose farm, glass dome, and magnetic storm are vivid, selective, and causally active: the dome’s groan narrows options, the vent enables escape. The “strangely organic” box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Could edge higher if the storm’s sensory signature were more idiosyncratic to Aris’s sensors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the roses or lose the sole testament to beauty—tightens once when miniaturization becomes the only path. Escalation is causal and visible: each crack raises the cost of delay. The final burn exacts the dome’s destruction as price; tension never slackens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of nostalgia-as-flaw reframed as compass emerges through concrete action; no moralizing. The empty box and glowing seed-roses offer a resonant, non-literal answer: fragmentation reassembled into portable wholeness. Subtext in the tear’s glow and the box’s warmth carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—measured, sensor-laden, yet haunted by human residue. Syntax modulates under pressure: longer reflective cadences collapse into clipped commands (“Miniaturize”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to android POV. One minor register drift—“profound silence” edges toward editorial—but forgivable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sensory specificity—“crimson blooms shriveled to grains”—propels momentum. A single mixed metaphor—“static clung like desert dust”—is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: android nostalgia, magnetic pole shift, and controlled-burn escape cohere into an inevitable final image. The miniaturized farm as portable memory seed feels non-obvious yet earned. Risk in blending hard-SF physics with lyrical nostalgia pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
