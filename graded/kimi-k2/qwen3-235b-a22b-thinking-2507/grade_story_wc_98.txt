<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor versus luminous doubt—is embodied in every beat; the final renunciation of certainty carries a felt cost when she whispers thanks to the dreamers. Lyra’s child-voice is distinct, her inherited lullaby a credible conduit of memory. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: data fork vs. dream song. No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (dream decoding → finding Lyra → singing to seed) tightens options until the sapling’s rooting forecloses loss of ridge. Closure is a Decisive Change—seed sprouts, ridge secured—paid for by Elara’s surrender of epistemic control. Cost legible in “luminous doubt would always linger.” Orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ridge, moonpetals, and tuning fork constrain tactics: blossoms shiver at Lyra’s pitch, fork measures resonance. Weather pressure (monsoon edge) directly alters urgency and final rooting. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no white-room syndrome. Micro-setting (seedbed of crushed petals) functions as charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect cultural memory via seed—signaled early. Escalation is causal: time tightening, monsoon approaching, seed must sprout. One meaningful tightening when Lyra’s song becomes the only viable key. Cost is the irreversible exposure of memory to communal flood; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges: memory is both empirical data and embodied song. Subtext in Elara’s doubt vs. communal chorus. Final image reweights premise—truth is measured and magical—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “empirically whimsical” diction, sensory synesthesia (“notes that vibrated in Elara’s bones”). Rhythm modulates with urgency; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but voice-specific when Lyra sings. No filter-verb stacks under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density, zero loops. Figurative language disciplined: “luminous doubt” recurs with earned weight. No mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates toward climax. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: reality-checker who must validate dreams via empirical whimsy. Seed-as-memory-tree trope transformed by sonic germination. Risk in blending science and magic pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
