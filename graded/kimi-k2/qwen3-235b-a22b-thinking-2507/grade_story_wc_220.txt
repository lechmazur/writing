<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and scent-driven, yet late appearance of cost keeps it just under 9.0; final renunciation (“He wouldn’t dig…”) is credible but not deeply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens upheld—each sensory block tightens the longing. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush “expectant” and the map reweight prior loss with conceptual cost of foregoing body-seeking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cracked yard and rust palette anchor every move; leaf and cylinder act as micro-settings that constrain later discovery, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“translate distance to closeness”—clarified by mid-text discovery; cost is intellectual revelation rather than palpable loss, softening top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of translation after war crystallizes quietly; final non-literal map image offers resonant reconfiguration without sermon. Sentiment skirted but not exploited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is sustained, scent-cued lyricism; no dialogue hence slight visibility cap remains at 8.8 gate. Rhythm compresses under emotional torque.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line craft precise; couple of ornamental metaphors (“jagged skyline of twisted metal bones”) stay within tolerance, no artifact in final third. Prose sings through compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bloodhound decoder conceit fresh; transforms ware-searching trope by replacing corpse quest with textual map, risk pays off in organic closure.</comment>
