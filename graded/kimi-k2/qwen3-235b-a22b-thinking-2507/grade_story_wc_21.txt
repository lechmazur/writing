<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his fingers “smudged with lagoon sediment,” the diary’s “retrocognitively trapped sorrow” clinging like humidity—but the final beat of scrambling down the ladder feels slightly under-motivated; the cipher key arrives as gift rather than earned cost. Still, his embodied dread and micro-choices (arranging debris, touching the diary) keep him credibly flawed and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the debris pattern re-orients from “south” to “down,” forcing Elias to the lagoon’s edge where the key is found—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The retrocognitive loop tightens, then snaps, with the moonlit tears as visible cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, brass telescope, and scattered shells are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the lagoon’s mirror-surface literally guides Elias’s final move when the arrow points “down.” Micro-setting (deck, black sand) constrains action without clutter. One minor drift: “lagoon sediment” on fingers after three days feels slightly off, but doesn’t derail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the retrocognitive trap and recover Cora’s cipher key—is signaled early and tightened when the visions intensify. The debris parley is the single meaningful turn that narrows options from “signal south” to “dig here.” Cost is felt in the “searing reverie” and the final tears, though the physical price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of unfinished justice emerges through Elias’s tactile communion with the past; no moralizing, only the moonlit image of the key held aloft. The lagoon’s dark mirror and the glowing shells reweight the premise without exposition. Subtext in the debris messages (“KEY”) is understated and resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyric, and filtered through Elias’s archivist precision (“ghosts of ink and intention”). Syntax modulates with stress: longer, humid sentences collapse into the staccato scramble down the ladder. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“bruised twilight,” “wound in the earth”) is selective and never muddles causality. One minor loop: “He wasn’t just cataloging; he was arranging…” restates intent, but the rhythm justifies it. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing a floating civil-rights archive, retrocognitive time-loop, and beach-debris semaphore feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The lagoon-as-memory-mirror and the zeppelin library are not ornamental; they shape tactics and closure. Specificity anchors the speculative frame in tactile grief.</comment>
