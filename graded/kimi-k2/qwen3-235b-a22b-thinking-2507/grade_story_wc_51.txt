<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich—her contradictory impulses (collect burdens vs. calcify her own) are embodied in the tactile ritual—but the “fractal weaver” label is never dramatized; it remains ornamental. The final smile is earned because the prior beats show her accepting the cost of adding her own regret to the satchel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds: entry → ritual orientation → collection → entrapment. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the snow seals the grotto, crystallizing her endless task. Cost is legible—“the weight sinking deep into her bones.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, starlight, and kerosene flame are not backdrop; they constrain every move—shadow angle reveals burdens, flame level governs pliability. Micro-setting (lamp burner) literally shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collect burdens without being consumed—tightens when each stone adds literal weight. Agency is ritual precision; each orientation forecloses escape further. Felt cost accrues beat by beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of recursive consequence emerges through the calcification metaphor; no explicit statement. Final image of endless reverie crystallizes the thematic cost without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s sensory filter; diction (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) is consistent and character-specific. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined to the grotto’s metallics and snowmelt. Occasional lyric excess (“time pooled like oil”) is brief and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of grief-collection into mineral ritual; the fractal-weaver concept is fresh, though under-used. Risk-taking in boundary-less entrapment pays off in the final snow-sealed image.</comment>
