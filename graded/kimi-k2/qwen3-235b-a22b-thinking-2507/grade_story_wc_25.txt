<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s gait-recognition trait is embodied in two on-page choices (mimicking electrician, limping past Rourke) that cost him physical strain and risk. Interiority stays concrete: “pulse quickened,” “coin pressed like promise.” Final smile shows earned endurance with cost—the Whisperer’s proof exacts ongoing vigilance. No contradictory impulses in scene, but trait never complicates his self-image, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore tightens options—map leads → key turns → coin slot → closure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “quiet truths travel farthest” crystallizes stakes without shouting. Cost legible in storm isolation and future Whisperer threat. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-green haze, vibrating containers, and bioluminescent ink constrain tactics—radios dead, cranes at risk. Container Gamma-12’s hollow floor slot is micro-setting that enables closure. Sensory selection mirrors urgency: “metal hum beneath palms.” Environment charges final image: crimson aurora over silent port.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver coin by dawn or port crippled—signaled early and tightened by storm blackout. One meaningful escalation: Rourke’s presence forces mimicry that risks exposure. Cost is social (future Whisperer tests) and operational (cranes remain hostage). Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: whispers vs. shouts tested by silent puzzle navigation. Subtext in coin’s Libra balance—justice without noise. Final phrase “quiet truths travel farthest” offers non-literal, earned resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about next Whisperer move.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Silas’s perceptual filter: “his body calibrated,” “light and hesitant” gait. Syntax mirrors stealth—short, fluid clauses under pressure. No head-hopping; Rourke’s frustration shown externally. Voice distinct in occupational diction (“Junction Seven,” “Gamma-12”) without jargon dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: “storm-lashed stacks,” “whisper-precision” compress action and atmosphere. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors stay coherent—containers as tuning forks. Final line cadence mirrors earned hush. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic noir with maintenance-worker spy craft. Gait-recognition as biometric lock feels inevitable. Whisperer puzzle reframes port security as quiet warfare. Risky 3-D bioluminescent map pays off in closure. Specificity prevents template feel.</comment>
