<comment>Elara’s deafness is the hinge on which every sensory and emotional choice rests; her decision to try the broken needle backward is a fresh, credible risk that reconfigures her stakes on the page. The embodied tension between tactile vibration and remembered sound, plus the shared resonance with Silas, produces immediate, character-earned cost that forecloses isolation without tidy recovery. Interiority stays concrete— “shockwaves… up her arms” —never lapses into therapy‐speak.</comment>

<comment>The causal sequence is airtight: needle snapped → curiosity → reversed groove → unfamiliar pulses → ruptured numbness → shared resonance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara does not regain hearing yet reclaims the possibility of felt music, paying the cost of lifelong altered listening. Every object state (needle position, flywheel crank) is tracked cleanly to the final beat.</comment>

<comment>The oak stave, cold brass horn, cavern wall, and tremor through stone are not backdrop but actants—they transmit vibration to both Elara and Silas, co-conscribing their discovery. Spatial choreography holds across the single scene, and the winter leaves skittering underfoot tighten time without leaving the drum-cavern. Setting constrains options (everything must be felt) and charges the final hand-against-wall image.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming intimacy with sound—escalates under the tactile lens: “grey fog” shifts to “filament of hush made tangible” via one decisive micro-turn. Cost is palpable in Elara’s exposed ribs and teeth, Silas’s palm vibrating against stone; the tightening forecloses retreat but leaves an open future. Coincidence is absent; agency remains tactile.</comment>

<comment>The theme that silence contains its own music emerges entirely through embodied action, never statement. The reversal of the Fifth (iconic silence-within-form) becomes a resonant Repricing of what counts as listening. No final paragraph moralizes—the cavern’s mirrored hush leaves the concept reweighted, ambiguous but earned.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lyrical, tactile free indirect style remains Elara’s POV without slippage: syntax mimics vibration—“shockwaves up her arms” compresses under pressure while retaining intelligibility. Dialogue is minimal and precise; Elara’s signing is shown in movement, not decoded exposition. Every lexical choice roots in the drum-maker’s sensorium.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and cadenced—“a filament of hush, she thought”—no redundancy, no filler verbs. Rhythm surges at peak moments then loosens in afterglow; imagery remains concrete and internally consistent. No mixed metaphors; no scaffold loops obscure cause or cost.</comment>

<comment>A deaf musician finding art inside a broken needle playing records backward is conceptually startling yet here feels inevitable—both character logic and material constraint dictate it. The transformation feels novel beyond gimmick because specificity of vibration and cavern acoustics root it. Prior elements gain new resonance in hindsight (grey fog recast as sonic potential), fulfilling the transformation test.</comment>
