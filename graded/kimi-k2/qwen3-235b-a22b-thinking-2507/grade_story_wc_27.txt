<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot contact with the permacrete and the hum beneath her skin embody her motivation; the internal contradiction—awkward confidence versus gnawing void—drives her micro-choice to kneel and align the glasses. The final renunciation of war for resonance carries a felt cost: she forfeits immediate vengeance for uncertain renewal. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (bruised purples, burnt wiring, tectonic pulse) thickens until the dawn light and amplified hum reconfigure the rebellion’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where Elara crystallizes a non-violent path; the cost is the abandonment of armed revolt. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cracked permacrete, drone husks, and faint blue veins of light under the floor function as micro-setting that literally guides Elara’s final gesture; the opera glasses warm and amplify the stone circle, charging the ending. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and vibration over sight, tightening focus. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: revive the rebellion’s soul without weapons. Pressure tightens when the hum syncs with her heartbeat, forcing the choice to amplify rather than destroy. The visible cost is the surrender of violent tactics; the lull becomes fertile ground. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the shift from fury to resonance; the hum beneath rubble embodies continuity versus empire. No explicit moralizing—final image of dawn widening into fertile ground reweights prior chaos. Subtext in the silence after battle carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature—oil-stained cold, tectonic pulse up her arms. Syntax lengthens with wonder then compresses under decision. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; diction remains within scavenger lexicon. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Metaphors (bruised purples, spent thruster) are precise and consistent with world. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stone-circle ley-line resonance as revolutionary praxis. Opera glasses repurposed from dead diplomat to amplifier of planetary memory. Risk in quiet, non-violent closure pays off. Specificity of barefoot contact and tarnished brass anchors universals.</comment>
