<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s vow and the immediate bodily stakes (freezing feet, sting of salt) embed motive, yet interior shifts feel compressed rather than contradictory; no credible flip or new flaw emerges under pressure. The mallet as talisman is felt but never complicated by doubt. Cost: she kneels at the end, yet the choice reads incremental rather than renunciative. Still, her musical obsession is particular enough to individuate.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens sustained: each rhythmic fractal layer intensifies texture until the wave’s crest becomes harmonic surf—Resonant Reconfiguration by Earned Poise (“the sea breathed in tune”). Orientation secure within 120w (“At the blue hour…Elara stood barefoot”). Final image crystallizes transformed chaos; cost is legible in fatigued kneel.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The orchard-driftwood microsetting continuously constrains movement and instrument choice; wave height functions as kinetic architecture. Blue-hour lighting and salt-sting specifics anchor the body without sliding into tour-guide list. Fractal echoes make the driftwood, roots, and crate become the very keys that save her, satisfying closure gate.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Storm’s menace escalates from bruised clouds to breaching wave; each turn forces Elara to alter sonic tactic in micro-time (“jammed splintered planks as impromptu keys”, “struck the wave’s crest”). Persistent tool loss and bodily fatigue impose visible price. Central stake remains singular—turn threat into music—and lands with earned modulation.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</question>
<comment>Theme emerges in musical alchemy rather than didacticism; chaos-to-harmony image reconfigures without preach text. Final line reframes earlier dread into “possibility with each swell.” Avoids moral; subtext lives in action. A touch of thematic echo near the end mutes but does not break resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Oceanic lyric register is consistent: sensory selectivity, synesthetic verbs (“waves crashed harder like a snare drum”). Purposeful compression—“sketched resonance,” “restless euphony”—reads as taught pattern paid off at closure. Voice remains anchored in Elara’s salt-crusted POV without head-hop.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Sentences carry polyrhythmic propulsion that mirrors thematic action; only minor loop from “sketched resonance” echoed twice near end. Figurative load is high but justified by fractal conceit. Read-aloud music serves urgency without clarity break.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Marine-musical synthesis feels inevitable in retrospect: “storm as instrument” isn’t gimmick but character-extending technique. Tired trope of “prophet tames nature” is inverted—the storm is not mastered but translated. Ending crystallizes as non-obvious Conceptual Repricing. One minor risk: driftwood-keys idea flirts whimsy yet stays integrated.</question>
