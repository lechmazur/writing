<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied grief and tactile navigation are vivid; contradictory impulses (seeking stillness yet fearing its cost) play out in real time. Micro-choices—kneeling, scraping earth, tracing the final note—are character-specific and escalate stakes. Closure choice (forging the map of healing) is earned by prior sensory struggle and carries felt cost. Minor: “quiet blaze within” flirts with label-speak but is immediately grounded in physical action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of musical notes intensifies until melody fuses into Earned Stasis. Closure—the lullaby resolving into silence—reconfigures grief without external fix; cost is the irrevocable recognition that stillpoint is internal. No orientation drift; anchors (forest, constellation pause) taught early and paid off. One seamless scene; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is rendered through skin-level perception, constraining every step; moss, stones, and shifting constellations act as tactile clock and map. Micro-setting (platinum ring, engraved stones) doubles as emotional barometer. Final image of dirt-sketched melody fuses setting with interior cartography, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate stillpoint to anchor grief—tightens as constellation pause wanes. Each absorbed note raises emotional cost; final silence is not relief but charged poise where grief and peace coexist. No external antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and emotional. One clear deepening: realization that stillpoint must be forged, not found.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: grief as uncharted terrain mapped by bodily sensation. Subtext in brother’s lullaby embedded in stones avoids overt statement. Final reconfiguration—stillpoint as internal melody—reweights earlier quest without moralizing. Resonant ambiguity: healing is ongoing, not resolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile specificity; perceptual signature of a blind cartographer is consistent and immersive. Syntax modulates with urgency—short clauses under time pressure, longer cadences during absorption of notes. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly fused to Elara’s skin-level perception. Compression (“constellation pause thinning”) is taught early and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and emotional stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (“notes etched like braille”) is precise and pattern-taught. Rhythm accelerates toward climax then breathes into final silence. Minor: “hollow ache behind her ribs” is borderline cliché but saved by immediate physical follow-through.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—blind cartographer navigating grief via sonic forest—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (quest for magical stillpoint) are transformed through embodied perception and star-metal compass that dowses for silence. Risky lyric compression pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
