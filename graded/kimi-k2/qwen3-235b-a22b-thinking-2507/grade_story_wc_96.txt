<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—trembling Scribe vs. defiant Architect—is dramatized in the moment he presses the new verse into the tin; the embodied shiver of moonlight on skin and the tactile memory of Mateo’s gift give motive force. The monthly molt is more label than lived constraint, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: scattering the blank papers crystallizes the risk of exposure while the tin’s hidden line secures continuity. Causal chain holds—moonrise triggers persona shift, shift enables planting the seed—though the Mateo flashback slightly dilutes present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library’s “skeletal shelves” and “flaking iron” are not backdrop but cradle; the cold chair and dented tin constrain where Elias can hide the verse. Moonlight as liquid silver re-enters the final image, re-weighting the ruin as birthplace rather than tomb.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will tonight’s line survive the city’s hunt—tightens when Elias chooses to scatter the blanks, trading stealth for reach. Cost is felt: the act makes the Penny Poet easier to track, yet the seed is planted. One clear escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty from anarchy” emerges from the ruined library, the false-bottom tin, and the final luminous fracture; no moral is stated. The rust remembering iron reweights the earlier decay into latent strength, achieving Conceptual Repricing without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and moonlit: “liquid silver,” “flaking iron,” “luminous fracture.” Compression and elision are purposeful; the single POV never wavers. Distinct perceptual signature carries through peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motive. No loops or mixed metaphors; “the rust remembers iron” is precise. Rhythm modulates with the moon’s climb, accelerating toward the scatter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The vagrant-poet moon-shifter seeding verses in a ruined library feels inevitable yet fresh; Mateo’s gift of the tin transforms a familiar trope into lived history. Risk—public scatter under watchful towers—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
