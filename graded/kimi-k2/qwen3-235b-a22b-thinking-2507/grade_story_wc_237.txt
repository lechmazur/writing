<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, crystallizing knuckles, the tremor that locks joints—yet the epiphany that “scars could be ink” arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost. Still, the embodied affliction and micro-choice to abandon the tea for the quill earn a credible shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the last crystal dissolves, the rune “transformation” glows, and the platform’s hush reweights the premise—storytelling as survival. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each inscribed rune thickens pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating rock, veined moss, and storm-eye hush are selective and tactile; the platform’s faint vibration after the sky-whale rune shows setting constraining choice. Micro-setting (tea bowl catching liquid light) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate or be branded fraud—tightens when crystallization threatens Kael’s ability to write; the act of inscribing loss, fear, loneliness escalates pressure and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: crystals shed, tea abandoned, final rune glows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories transmute trauma into meaning. The crow quill, grandmother’s superstition, and glowing ink form a quiet but resonant answer without moralizing. Final image of “fresh ink that glowed with inner light” reweights prior scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“saturated hush,” “petrified bones of sky-whales”—with rhythmic control that mirrors Kael’s held breath. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and stakes. Minor scaffold—“the saturated hush deepened, absorbing the scratch of quill on stone”—is earned by pattern. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of rune magic, crystallizing affliction, and sky-whale folklore feels inevitable and fresh. The risk of abandoning the tea ceremony for spontaneous inscription heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
