<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—protocol vs. humility—play out in the moment of public self-indictment; the embodied tremor and deliberate touch of the clipboard ground her interiority. The cost is palpable: political suicide made concrete in the promise to dismantle the outpost. Kael’s flicker of possible trust alters their crucible. Only a trace of diagnostic self-awareness (“ash in her mouth”) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: misjudged ceasefire → present overreach → negotiated admission → possible trust. Closure is an Earned Stasis: she forecloses her own career path with visible institutional cost (“publicly censure him, dismantle the outpost”). Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The terrace’s heat, cracked mosaics, and skeletal fortifications mirror Elara’s scarred psyche and constrain the negotiation space; the clipboard’s reflected sunlight charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (sun-baked stone, tremor in hands) stays under POV pressure. Only the valley vista risks postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redemption via exacting honesty—tightens when Elara admits fault and accepts the price. One meaningful turn: her confession narrows options and forces Kael’s engagement. Cost is legible in the promised dismantling and political fallout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemption as daily, imperfect practice emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The flawed beauty of the terrace reweights from tomb to foundation in the final image, offering resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile focus on clipboard, heat, tremor; controlled syntax mirrors Elara’s deliberate calm. Dialogue carries subtext (“Why?” raw). No head-hopping; POV remains tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm and information density; figurative language is purposeful (“ash in her mouth,” “midsummer moth”). One paraphrase loop (“operative gentle” twice) and a minor filter verb cluster keep it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—atonement through public confession—is transformed by the specificity of the forever-war context and the negotiator’s ritualized vulnerability. Fresh inflection lies in the clipboard’s charged reprise and the terrace’s flawed beauty. Slight risk hedging in Kael’s too-swift softening.</comment>
