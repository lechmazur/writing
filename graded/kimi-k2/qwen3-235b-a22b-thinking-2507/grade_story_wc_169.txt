<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—salt-crystal fractals, needle tremors—but the “logical dreamer” label is asserted more than embodied; her final equation lands as earned epiphany yet the cost (isolation) is only implied, not dramatized on her body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the gauge locks at 100 ft across timelines, crystallizing hope as communal physics. Causal chain holds—each balloon failure tightens the next pattern—though the leap to Timeline D feels lightly gifted rather than wrested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto is tactile and constraining—water laps, crystals cut fingers, gauge anchors the eye. Light refracting through diamond-pattern balloon charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving hope can float—escalates via each balloon’s fate; the 100-ft lock is a decisive tightening that forecloses solitary hope. Cost is conceptual (shared vulnerability required) but still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from iterative experiment: hope as dynamic system of interdependence. Final equation is earned, not sermonized; resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“serene upheaval,” “salt-crystal fractal”—anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias. No head-hop; compression (“gauge clicked to 100 feet”) teaches pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked modifiers (“bioluminescent mist,” “tentative equations”) risk overwriting yet rhythm stays controlled. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum-timeline grotto as physics lab for hope. Risky structure (parallel timelines) heightens stakes without gimmickry; diamond-pattern payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
