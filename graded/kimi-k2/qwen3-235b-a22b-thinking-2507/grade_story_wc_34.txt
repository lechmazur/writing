<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her grief-choked silence, the bolt plate biting her palm, the rusty voice breaking into song—yet the “driftingly alert” trait never visibly constrains a choice; it reads as atmospheric rather than causal. The final renunciation of silence is earned by the bolt plate’s re-weighting and the ghost’s plea, but the cost (permanent exposure of her voice) is implied rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost’s lonely code is re-tuned into shared music, Elara’s silence foreclosed. Causal chain holds—bolt plate anchors signal, chalk encodes reply, song completes circuit—yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensifies until the courtyard sings. No orientation drift; anchors (mist, stone, plate) are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is no postcard; its vapor thins to reveal graffiti, its flagstones chill bare feet, its air conducts code. The bolt plate functions as micro-setting—weight, warmth, groove—constraining how Elara stabilizes the ghost’s signal. Final image recharges the opening chill with luminous notation swirling like “liquid smoke.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ghost’s need for voice vs. Elara’s fear of using hers—tightens once: from reading symbols to singing aloud. Escalation is Accumulative: each graffito blooms brighter, bolt plate glows hotter, until song becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in the rusty voice breaking, but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unheard voices seeking conduit emerges through concrete particulars—rust, chalk, neon veins—never stated. Final image of musical notation swirling like sheet music made of light offers non-literal answer: connection is possible only at the cost of exposure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the thunder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression (“liquid smoke,” “captured lightning”) taught early and sustained; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors Elara’s tentative re-entry into sound—short, breath-held clauses swelling into the ballad line. POV modesty holds; she never knows more than the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and world data without redundancy. Metaphors are precise—“neon veins,” “sheet music made of light”—and never muddle causality. No loops, no scaffold, no register drift; rhythm accelerates into the sung line then settles with the cooling plate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fusion of post-Skyfall digital ghost and folk-balladeer feels inevitable, not gimmick: the bolt plate’s analog weight bridging code and song. Graffiti-as-interface is fresh, specific, and grounded. Risk in lyric mode pays off; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
