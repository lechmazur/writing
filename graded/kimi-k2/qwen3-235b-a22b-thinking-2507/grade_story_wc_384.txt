<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tremor in her hand and the tear-ink anchor her contradictory impulses. The inherited shame and present task create credible tension, though the ancestor’s “silent plea” edges toward convenient epiphany. The final renunciation—lighter burden, not absolution—earns its cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chrysanthemum erased, the seal restored, the family debt paid. Causal chain holds—thorn finds flaw, flaw severs lie—under an Accumulative/Textural lens where density and cadence shift reweight the stake. The dripping stalactite heartbeat seals the moment with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and rose-thorn micro-setting constrain every move: light reveals the chrysanthemum, thorn’s fineness limits the repair. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—lapis dust, gallnut ink, pearl twilight—each detail earns its place. Final aurora pulse recharges the opening image, crystallizing the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore Lin’s lineage without exposing the restoration project—tightens once: the thorn’s pressure severs the false bond. Escalation is Accumulative: each drip, each breath, each micron of wax removed raises the cost of error. The price is the perpetual secrecy Elara must now carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “forgiving the unfinished” emerges through the act itself—no moralizing, only the precise cut. The rose-thorn’s journey from imperial bloom to tool of absolution reweights history’s fabric without sermon. Final image of pearl twilight guiding her back into night offers quiet, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, syntax mirroring the slow drip of time and the micron-level precision of the task. No head-hop; perceptual signature is Elara’s—lapis-dusted fingers, tear-salted ink. Compression and patterned elision (“less than a moth’s wingbeat”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers texture or stakes. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“infinite pressure, less than a moth’s wingbeat”—then exhales with the final drop. Read-aloud ear test passes at peak intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—restorative forgery as moral duty—feels fresh and inevitable. Rose-thorn as key-with-no-lock, aurora in a marble sanctuary: specific synthesis, not ornament. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure reconfigures meaning rather than delivering twist.</comment>
