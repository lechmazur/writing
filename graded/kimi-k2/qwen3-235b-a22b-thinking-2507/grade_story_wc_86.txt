<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied; the brass pull anchors guilt without lapsing into label-speak. The contradiction between protocol and personal loss drives every beat, culminating in the micro-choice to release Vanya. The cost—his own unabsolved guilt—remains palpable. Only the envoy’s blankness keeps the relationship crucible from full ignition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drawer pull shifts from relic to repurposed tool, reconfiguring Aris’s stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is tight—moon phase, mist, midpoint meeting—each beat thickens the hush until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is immediate; no drift. The cost is felt in the unsaid apology.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parapet’s slick stone and swallowing mist constrain movement and visibility, shaping the silent choreography of the exchange. The drawer pull itself becomes micro-setting, its brass edges grounding Aris’s sensory focus. Weather and neutral ground are not backdrop but active pressure. Final image recharges both parapet and pull.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing Vanya to recycle his own failure—is signaled early and tightened by the moon’s waning. One decisive intensification: the envoy’s nod triggers the untethering, foreclosing Aris’s lingering self-punishment. Cost is visible in the still-closed fist around the pull. Agency remains entirely Aris’s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging broken things emerges through the drawer pull’s journey from ash to anchor to repurposed wisdom. No moralizing; the final image of the brass cooling in his palm reweights the entire premise. Ambiguity lingers—neither apology nor forgiveness offered—yet the conceptual cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, weathered, and consistent with a negotiator who measures silence. Syntax tightens under pressure—“the furrowed hush deepening”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is selective: mist, brass, stone. No dialogue contamination; the envoy’s silence is voiced through gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“mist thick as grief” earns its place. Rhythm mirrors the held-breath tension until the final release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The moon-phase prisoner swap in no-man’s-land feels mythic yet grounded in tactile detail. The drawer pull’s transformation from domestic fragment to moral instrument is a fresh synthesis. Risk is taken in the near-wordless climax, paid off by the charged poise of the ending.</comment>
