<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s shift from certainty to curiosity is embodied in the tactile hobo-nickel choice; the micro-choice to strike it crystallizes her arc. Interiority is vivid and specific, though the visitor remains a cipher, limiting relational crucible. The final renunciation of perfectionist certainty carries visible cost in her altered future work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s living song reweights Elara’s stance with felt cost—she will “never restore a mural the same way again.” Causal chain (nickel → sound → awakenings → irreversible shift) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail—crystalline mirrors, copper tuning fork, breathing stone—that directly constrains and enables the bewitching act. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s professional eye; setting evolves with each awakening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—perfection vs. curiosity—tightens once when Elara chooses the nickel strike, foreclosing her old method. Escalation is accumulative: each awakening deepens stakes until the final irreversible shift. Cost is legible in her vow of changed practice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: curiosity as restoration of self, not just walls. Subtext lives in the nickel’s pulse and the mural’s breathing stone. Final image of “true artistry lived in the pause” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, rhythmic, and consistent; free-indirect style stays anchored in Elara’s perception. Compression (“methodically playful precision”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the strike. No head-hop; diction remains within her artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous threads”) fits the lyric mode without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-as-pigment, mural-as-recording, nickel-as-tuning-key. Premise is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the living garden without gimmickry.</comment>
