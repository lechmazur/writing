<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—ritualized grief vs. the need to heal her family—are embodied in the blower-baton and the shredded-leaf mist; the final easing of her shoulders shows earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“frayed rope worn smooth by desperate hands”) and avoids therapy-speak. The only minor slip is a brief label “mournfully eager” that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each blower added thickens the wind-pattern until the cadence shift (laughter drifting back) reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief not erased but carried home—felt in the “fragile, restored melody.” Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel’s curved ribs shape the wind into an instrument; the leaf-mist becomes a second setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“concrete ribs arching like a leviathan”). The environment actively constrains tactics—vent geometry dictates how the lullaby reaches the house.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is the mounting wind density that forces the trade-off: shred the past to release it. Cost is visible in Elara’s raw throat and the engines’ dying roar. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief into shared sound emerges through concrete action; no moralizing. The final image of laughter drifting down the stone throat offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in the husband’s “choked, broken laugh” carries more weight than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, compressed, yet tactile (“leaf blower symphony conductor”). Syntax mirrors Elara’s ritual cadence; no head-hopping. Free-indirect style stays coherent; diction remains within her lexicon even at peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“leviathan ribs” echoed in “stone throat”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates with each blower start, then exhales in the dying engines. One mixed metaphor (“dust motes danced… suspended tears”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grief-into-wind ritual is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the leaf blower as requiem instrument feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the tunnel acoustics and the frayed pull cord prevents generic treatment. Risk-taking (mechanical requiem) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
