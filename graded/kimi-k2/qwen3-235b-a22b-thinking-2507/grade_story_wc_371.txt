<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—soil-dusted hands, trembling fingers on bread crust—yet the “creeping normality noticer” label is never dramatized; her noticing is shown but not leveraged as a trait that forces a higher-stakes choice. The guilt-to-absolution arc is credible, but the final forgiveness feels slightly generalized rather than paid for by a single, costly micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (bread, locket, candle) reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes a Charged Poise—“the silence felt like a seed waiting.” Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Closure lands with felt cost: she renounces restoring the past and accepts tending what remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful: the cracked throne-room steps and skeletal arbor constrain where seeds can be planted, and the tea-house candle’s glow charges the final absolution image. Spatial anchors are clear; ivy, rainwater, and marble interact with action rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guilt versus absolution—tightens through the locket’s discovery and the final renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the photo redefines the bread from relic to living memory. Cost is visible: she forfeits the last crust and accepts perpetual tending instead of restoration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinariness emerges organically from bread, locket, and soil; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “seed waiting” offers resonant, non-literal answer to how grief can be lived with. Subtext in the host’s line “the earth remembers” quietly reframes loss as continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s tactile, soil-stained attention. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—long, breath-held sentences during reflection, clipped fragments at discovery. No POV drift; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined and pattern-taught (“creeping normality,” “heuristically gentle”). No loops or scaffold. Sensory specificity (“burnt sugar and yeast a ghost”) does double duty as memory trigger and atmosphere. Final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: guerrilla gardening as quiet rebellion against bureaucratic abandonment, paired with a “normality noticer” who finds absolution not in protest but in tending. Risky lyric compression pays off; premise feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
