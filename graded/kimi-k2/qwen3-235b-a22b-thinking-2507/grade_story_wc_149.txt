<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s guilt and reluctant acceptance are embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, tears freezing, the final smile he returns—yet the ghost bride’s interiority is only gestured at, keeping her slightly archetypal. The debt motive is clear and escalates to self-erasure, but the “lovingly venomous” paradox is asserted more than dramatized in her actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms while the bride dissolves, cost paid on the page (“Debt repaid”). Causal chain—each bead strike revives yet frays her—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final chord crystallizes stakes without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The greenhouse’s perpetual night and frost-creaking panes constrain every move; the bead’s hum and crystallizing sap are tactile anchors. Setting charges the final image—warm bead in cold palm—mirroring the life/death exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—orchard’s survival vs. bride’s extinction—tightens with each bead use. One decisive intensification: the heartseed awakening that forecloses her existence. Cost is legible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of restorative harm emerges through the bead’s paradoxical gift; no moralizing, only the final image of vibrant blooms against vanished bride. Ambiguity lingers—was mercy or justice served—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating from hushed observation to resonant chord. Free indirect style stays locked to Silas; no head-hop. Syntax mirrors breath-fog and crystalline sap, rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves atmosphere without clutter. No loops or scaffold; “lovingly venomous” is the only near-abstraction, but context earns it. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Fusion of alchemical botany and karmic ghost story feels inevitable, not gimmick. The bead’s dual-edge revival is a fresh twist on sacrifice tropes. Specificity of moon-bloom orchids and heartseed sap anchors the fantastical in sensory truth.</comment>
