<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—hunger for proof vs. fear of error—drives every beat; the embodied shift from rigid certainty to humility is earned and costly. The prism’s final re-weighting as teacher rather than tool crystallizes the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism reveals projection, not absorption, shattering her epistemic stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (frost, mist, silence) tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning with visible cost (tears freeze, work must restart).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, mist, frost on glass, and the prism itself form a micro-setting that constrains perception and choice; the frost lattice literally rewrites itself under her gaze, charging the final realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—tightens when the frost starburst signals immediate feedback; the deepening shows projection, not absorption, forcing a costly reorientation of method and identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete reversal: observer creates meaning, object mirrors. The final image (gentle spirals replacing rigid fractals) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s mystical empiricism. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences collapse into clipped fragments at the moment of shattering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (mist as “spectral fingers,” frost as “cipher”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—empathic archaeology via crystalline memory—is familiar, but the inversion that the observer projects emotion feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of frost language and solstice timing grounds the concept.</comment>
