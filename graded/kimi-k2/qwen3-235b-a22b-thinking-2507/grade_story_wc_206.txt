<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silas’s flaw (rust covenant) manifests in crystallizing choice: one harmonic misstep costs flesh, forcing a visceral commitment deeper. Internal voice is distinct, grounded in scent of metal & shudder of copper. Passivity would drop it, but the choice to find peace in reclaimed light is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Causal engine tightens from missing light → frozen song → tether of resonance; climb is because/therefore, climax rips shroud because silica frequency fused. Closure lands on visible bloom under reclaimed star-light—felt, legible cost—adherence to inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dust motes, wilting lilies, copper walls are strategically cued—to note decay or birth; each informs next beat’s stakes. Resonance chamber not window-dressing; it is the single conduit. object-state changes in gear vibration do work beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes climb with each rusted graze and crumbling petal: dishonesty physically decays setting, urgency tangible. One decisive intensification (fuse stone resonance) tightens options at climax. Cost is legible—hands shivering, lilies ashes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of restorative truth emerges not lectured; decay (rust) mirrors moral decay and restoration reclaims stolen dawn. Final image—fresh lilies pushing through ash—offers resonant answer without stating moral. Pressure felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct texture: “metal’s secrets,” sonic tweezers, harmonic hammer all POV-faithful. Compression & cadence match urgency; one metallic sentence under pressure. No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm under pressure accelerates; sentence variety carries plot. No loops, no explanatory dumps, high sensory density. Minor filter verb ("He felt") once—bearable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>‘Covenant of rust’ as harmonic truth not merely trope: decays hands & tools—literally stakes its user. Closure reprises metal-song resonance; fresh angle via truth=blood-copper fusion lending specific weight as covenant paid.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Music box repairman’s covenant (rust) physically scars; choice to tether stone drives climax; removing him shatters causality and ending blooms.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Stone chip appears setup, mid-node tether, final burst—removing it voids light return; reweighted meaning eachbeat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rust covenant narrows option set—falsehood oxidizes tools; shapes every decision and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Wilts beside dishonesty enacted through crumbling lilies, visible cost front-row.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Tether action rig’s stone to city’s light—causal climax; switchable only by narrative collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Mending what isn’t torn is mechanism of song alignment—appears early as lilies crumble, central to ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Resonance chamber is single conduit and pressure point; vary setting = vary entire plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Midnight clock governs siphoning & release; dread thickens when countdown tightens.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Reclaiming stolen light is dramatized via torn basilica= voice pressures hands to rust—cost paid.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Tinkersong wonder threads through gears, hammer taps—climactic golden hum charges final image with fresh awe.</comment>
