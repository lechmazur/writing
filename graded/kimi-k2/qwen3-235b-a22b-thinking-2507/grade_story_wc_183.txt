<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid—her “blissfully aberrant calm” and salt-stained fingers anchor her—but the sister-motive is asserted more than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized until the final beat, so the earned-cost threshold is only partially met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lyra reweights her endless search as the very solace she sought. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo-thread thickens pattern until the emerald path ignites. Cost is legible in her acceptance of “trapped freedom.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fog-choked carnival ship is rendered in precise, sensory strokes; the emerald card and shifting decks constrain navigation and choice. Spatial logic is maintained even amid surreal folds, and the final image of the “wall of woven light” charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Elara’s name—is clear early. Pressure tightens as each recaptured thread narrows Lyra’s path toward the hull’s wound; the cost is the acceptance of perpetual seeking. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-obligation emerges organically from Lyra’s refusal to abandon the search; the garden of forgotten names reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lingers in the “unkindled solace” becoming self-sustaining grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature tuned to salt, fog, and phosphorescence. Syntax modulates with pressure—compressed during descent, expansive at revelation—without head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; only minor loops (“salt-encrusted carousel, frozen mid-spin” could trim). Metaphors cohere, rhythm breathes, and no artifact intrudes on the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The carnival-ship-as-memory-labyrinth feels fresh; tropes of lost-sister quests and haunted vessels are transformed through moss-cards and narrative weaving. The synthesis is specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
