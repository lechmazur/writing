<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven obsession vs. the need for serenity—are embodied in her tactile handling of the resonator and the lilies. The botanist’s mirrored gesture provides relational pressure that alters her stance. The final smile is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost: she renounces sound forever. Minor slip: “rectify” used diagnostically once without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the resonator’s hum reweights silence from loss to canvas. Causal chain—lilies’ steady heat → resonator calibration → coherent frequencies—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the tuning fork case now “empty of metal but full of purpose.” No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The winterglass conservatory’s ice-veined walls and glacial lilies constrain every choice: cold dictates thermal signatures, glass fractures light into usable data. The lilies’ unwavering blue heat signature is the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. One hairline slip: “star-salted sky” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens when chaotic data refuses coherence. One decisive deepening: aligning resonator with lilies’ steady heat rectifies emotional turbulence into usable frequencies. Cost is the irreversible acceptance of a soundless world. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as generative canvas rather than void. The final image—botanist’s golden aura blending with lilies’ blue—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in thermal hues and mirrored gestures. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled compression (“liquid moonlight”). Perceptual signature is Elara’s synesthetic noticing of heat-as-music. No head-hopping; POV stays interior and consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short clauses under frustration, longer cadences at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“frost ferns’ silver tracery a harp glissando” integrates setting and concept. One minor register drift: “conceptual cost” could feel academic, but context justifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—composing music from thermal signatures in post-catastrophe silence—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (deaf composer, greenhouse sanctuary) are transformed through specific thermal science and crystalline resonator. Risk-taking (soundless music) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
