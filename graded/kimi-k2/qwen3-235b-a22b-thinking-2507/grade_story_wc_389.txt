<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart hammered against her ribs”), her contradictory impulses (faith in Prophet vs. new evidence) play out in real time, and her final choice to weaponize the Portico is earned by prior causality. The cost—loss of her last illusion and exposure to the sky-cutter—is legible on the page. Minor slip: “etched into her bones” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage (static → coherent fragment → tactical reroute → resonance). Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the Prophet’s beam refracts, storm eases, Elara’s stance crystallizes. No orientation drift; anchors land by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cobalt portico, stormlit observatory, and radio dish are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the portico’s lattice reroutes power, the dish feeds the prophecy, the storm’s lightning times the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“frozen finger,” “green dials”). One minor spatial hiccup: exact distance to sky-cutter is vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent atmospheric collapse—signaled early and escalates through each decoded fragment. One meaningful tightening: realization that Prophet aims to shatter the portico forces immediate sabotage. Cost is visible (exposed position, rerouted power). Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “dawn woven from shadow” emerges organically from Elara’s choices and the portico’s violet flare; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights earlier star-shadow texts without stating a thesis. Subtext in the child’s voice (“blind to the eighth”) lands with chilling precision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail; perceptual signature is consistent (“stormlit observatory’s panoramic view,” “ghosts in the static”). Compression and patterned elision (“lyrically prophetic verses hummed through the ether”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“crown of broken teeth”) and never muddles causality. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during sabotage, longer cadences in reflection. One minor loop: “ancient shadows” appears three times in close succession.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes (last astronomer, false prophet) are transformed through the harmonic-portico mechanic and the reversal that darkness, not light, saves the world. Specificity of cobalt glass and radio prophecy feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode is fully integrated, not gimmick.</comment>
