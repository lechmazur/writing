<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the grief-etched urgency—but the child Kael remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses in him, so the crucible is one-sided. Motivation is clear and intensifies, yet the “last child” premise is asserted rather than dramatized. Final renunciation (world for one ember) is earned and costly, satisfying the Earned Stasis test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the emerald’s glow reconfigures oblivion into witness. Causal chain—pattern in static → precise timing → infusion—holds; no teleporting props. Orientation is immediate; “skyborne grotto” anchors by line 3. One transition (earth-lights winking out) is seamless. Cost is legible in the final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is selective: obsidian slab, moon-bloom scent, auroral hush. The grotto’s crystalline walls and the chip’s glow constrain the ritual space and final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight under pressure. Micro-setting (the slab and chip) functions as locus and tool, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve one spark—signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: the three-beat cadence fading to silence forces the decisive infusion. Cost is the irreversible loss of the world; agency is Elara’s timing and will. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: preservation against erasure, life in stillness. Subtext in the “radiant hush” and the chip’s pulse. Final image reframes oblivion as vessel, not void. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the eternal spark’s solitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “aurora bled emerald and violet,” “death rattle of the world.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s—cosmetic precision meets cosmic listening. Syntax modulates with urgency; no head-hopping. Compression (“Minutes bled…”) is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers scent, light, or rhythm. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“heartbeat underwater”) are coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant calm”) fits the elevated stakes. Final cadence slows to crystallize the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of beautician-morticician with cosmic undertaker feels fresh; the emerald chip as soul-capsule is inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyricism pays off in the Charged Poise. No derivative echoes; the premise commits fully to its elegiac logic.</comment>
