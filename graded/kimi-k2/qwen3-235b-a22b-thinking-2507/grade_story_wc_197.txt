<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet fury over his sister’s erasure is embodied in tactile micro-choices—palming the key, reading starlit puddles—rather than labels. The final renunciation (dropping the key and vanishing) is earned by prior resourcefulness and carries visible cost. Interiority stays concrete; no stock phrasing intrudes. One slip: the phrase “tyranny of indifference” edges toward label-speak, blunting the edge slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael forecloses escape by completing the upload and choosing disappearance, cost legible in the hiss of the dying terminal and the vanishing key. Causal chain—key → terminal → resonance window—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored early by the janitor’s cap and Sector 7 canal. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon’s mineral glow is not backdrop; its resonance frequency is the only conduit past firewalls, directly constraining the upload window. Micro-setting (half-submerged terminal, saltwater at knees) is tactile and stakes the body. Sensory selection narrows to urgency—ozone, decay, starlight on oil. One minor drift: “atmospheric static” feels like Ministry jargon rather than Kael’s perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs erasure—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the archive team is captured, forcing Kael’s lone play. Escalation is causal: capture → canal → terminal → drones. The final choice uploads data at the cost of exposure and self-erasure. No coincidence resolves; drones complicate, not rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory against indifference emerges through concrete acts—sweeping dust in coded patterns, dropping the key—not exposition. Final image of the glowing lagoon guiding future ghosts reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the dismissed “atmospheric static” quietly indicts the Ministry. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and consistent with a janitor’s perceptual bias: grime, motor hum, starlight on oil. Syntax tightens under pressure—“He didn’t run”—without losing coherence. No head-hopping or register drift. Compression (“ghost with a mop”) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances. Figurative language is selective—“liquid starlight” appears once, earned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with urgency. One near-repeat: “glowing” used twice in two lines near the end, but the effect is cumulative, not redundant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of janitor-as-rebel, obsolete phone key, and mineral-resonant lagoon feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (dystopian data purge, lone resistor) are transformed through sensory specificity and embodied stakes. The final vanishing act reconfigures the ghost motif rather than repeating it. Risk in the lyric map-from-puddles device heightens coherence.</comment>
