<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but generic; the “broken leash” and “unused courage” remain abstractions rather than embodied contradictions. No micro-choice under pressure reveals hierarchy of values; the star-shaped sand moment is epiphany-by-prop rather than earned shift. Motivation is stated, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (star imprint on skin) but cost is conceptual only; no persistent constraint or price is legible. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of images rather than causal chain—yet the final reweighting feels asserted rather than demonstrated. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mist, ridgeway, ferry, and black-sand beach are vividly sketched and filtered through Elara’s wary attention. Micro-setting (star-shaped hollow) constrains the final choice and charges the image. Details are selective and purposeful; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find unused courage”—is declared early but never tested; no narrowing of options or visible price. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical. The crossing itself is serene; tension does not escalate under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of courage-as-journey emerges through imagery rather than statement, but the final insight (“courage waits in the crossing”) is articulated by a guide, not dramatized by Elara’s choice. Subtext is present but thin; resonance is pleasant rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic variation. Ferry guides’ dialogue is minimal yet distinct; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Voice modulation under stress is slight but coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; occasional soft-focus phrases (“shoreline lullaby singing in her blood”) verge on purple but do not stall momentum. Metaphors stay coherent; no line-level artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-for-courage arc is refreshed by the ferry passage and star-stamp key, yet the transformation remains abstract. Specificity of the black-sand star gives a fresh inflection, but the overall pattern feels archetypal rather than surprising.</comment>
