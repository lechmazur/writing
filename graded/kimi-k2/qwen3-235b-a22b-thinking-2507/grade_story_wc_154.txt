<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is textured and embodied; the coral and cast act as concrete extensions of his psyche. The moment he re-codes “Alone” into “return” is a micro-choice that crystallizes his value hierarchy and costs him the talisman. Mei’s presence is brief but applies immediate pressure; their shared silence carries status shift. The only drag is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis in “survivor guilt,” slightly blunting the contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral’s transfer reweights both characters’ futures with felt cost. Causal chain—anesthetic slows time → coral decoding → re-coding cast → gifting coral—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The final image of Mei walking away with the coral crystallizes options without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist, bench, lanterns, and the coral’s tactile grooves are filtered through Aris’s drug-softened perception, constraining his slowed movements and sharpening focus. The atrium’s damp chill mirrors internal ache; the coral’s warmth against palm marks the shift from relic to gift. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating objects. Environment charges the final image rather than merely decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate pain into survivable meaning—tightens when Aris must decide whether to keep or surrender the coral. The act of re-coding Mei’s cast is the single decisive escalation that forecloses his own retreat into detachment. Cost is visible: he loses the last piece of Lantau and accepts fresh responsibility. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration through shared testimony emerges from the coral/cast interplay, never sermonized. The final loop symbol re-prices “Alone” without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: Mei’s cold hand over Aris’s, the coral’s warmth transferred. Resonance lingers in the image of wounds holding life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, modulating with anesthetic haze: “gentle watercolors of indigo and pearl.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Aris notices linguistic patterns in smudges, not generic pity. Syntax breathes with slowed time; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but authentic pidgin, carrying subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm mirrors drugged calm then crystalline focus. Minor elevated diction (“lotus-hearted ache”) is earned by voice context.</comment>

<comment>Fisherman’s cipher repurposed by a child to map trauma is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Coral-as-memory-key transforms from personal relic to shared map without gimmickry. Specific pidgin and reef lore ground universals. Risky lyric compression pays off in final image.</comment>
