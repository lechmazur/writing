<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “steady fingers” and “tranquil blaze” reveal resolve under pressure—but the elders’ absence keeps status dynamics off-page, limiting relational crucible. The final renunciation (remaining solitary sentinel) is earned by the ritual’s cost, yet her flaw (solitude as both strength and sentence) could be more sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is not broken but “contained within the flow of mapped silence,” a felt cost crystallized in the warm, inert wing. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence increases until it reweights the world. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brook, moss, and moonlit stones are not backdrop but active agents: the brook dissolves discord, the wing’s placement on river stone is spatially precise, and the “liquid silence” constrains tactics. Micro-setting (the wing as altar) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to hush the prophecy”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the wing absorbs the last “coded shriek,” foreclosing any chance of escape. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the wing’s warmth and Elara’s open-ended vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence as both refuge and burden emerges through concrete ritual action rather than statement. Final image of the spent wing on stone reweights earlier starlight and moss into a quiet, non-moral answer: containment over conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“terrestrially cosmic” coined once and earned by sensory braid of moss and nebulae. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long sentences during mapping, clipped fragments at absorption. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors; “smoothed hush” recurs with accrued weight. Occasional elevated diction (“terrestrially cosmic”) is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Folding silence into an origami wing that drinks prophecy is a fresh synthesis of mythic and tactile. Risky lyric compression taught early and held; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
