<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara emerges as a fully embodied artist-tracker—her trembling ink-stained hands, panting micro-decisions, and postponed moth draft vivify internal contradiction. Every beat (sketching, knife-strike, pendant pull) turns on her choice under rising stakes; her renunciation of linear time incurs palpable vertigo.</comment>

Linkage is clear, stretched time provides the unexpected escalation; minor slip: thaw exposition near midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rooftop canal’s liquid obsidian, knife’s metallic clang, and pendant’s heat function as tactile constraints—present, sensorily vivid, and repeatedly altered by action under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence escalates from symptom to causal trigger; borrowed time’s paradox escalates cost as centuries unfurl into the final image. Pressure crystallizes in the visible ripple of distorted air before echo release.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical, precise free-indirect control rules POV. Rhythm breathes with stakes: languid lettering gains staccato after knifelift; compression heightens without head-hop.</comment>

<comment>Prose carries painterly density—lines multiply jobs (sound, texture, motion); zero loop clutter; closing paragraph crystallizes light across canal in rhythmic taut cadence.</comment>

<comment>Interruption→borrow→reshape premise feels inevitable yet fresh; quiet lyricism risks silence birth without cliché; biggest risk is sheer audacity—exquisite payoff.</comment>
