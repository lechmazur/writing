<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—numb fingers, tear on sun-seed pods—yet the “shattered mosaic” mind remains more asserted than dramatized; the swaddling epiphany is earned but leans on a convenient memory cue rather than a visible contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sung fragment layers density until the final cadence reweights the realm. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—liquid dawn bursts, communities knit—cost paid in Elara’s total self-expenditure (“poured every ounce”). Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse, mica window, and glass fruit are tactile, selective, and evolve: frost-rimed → warm with reborn sun. The mica window constrains perception and later reframes the sunrise, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rekindle the dying realm”—is visceral and tightens through each sung thread; agency is cumulative singing that forecloses isolation. Cost is felt in Elara’s exhaustion and the orchard’s shuddering transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of communal repair through intimate, “small” songs emerges organically; the sunrise image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the tear activating sun-seed pods is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“glass fruit glowed with captured starlight”—and modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Compression (“Swaddling. The word resonated.”) is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor echo (“woven dawns” repetition) does not dull closure. No loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-keeper repairing reality via lullabies reframes epic fantasy stakes through domestic intimacy. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
