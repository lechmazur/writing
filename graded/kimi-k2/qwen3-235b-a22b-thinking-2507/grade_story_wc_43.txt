<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; her micro-choice to insist on the rooftop and her tactile handling of the vinyl shard reveal motive under pressure. Aris’s silent tear and air-tracing gesture show earned change without exposition. The only gap is that “decisively kind” is asserted more than dramatized in conflict with staff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final held gaze and sigh crystallize the flawless goodbye with unmistakable cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mundane sound layer tightens the emotional density until the broken hymn reconfigures memory. No orientation drift; rooftop, time, and players are anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Skyward Haven’s rooftop garden constrains the farewell—wind, pigeon coo, and lavender scent are woven into the sound ritual that enables closure. The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting, its tactile edge charging the final image. Selective sensory detail mirrors Aris’s narrowing consciousness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each added layer of mundane sound until the hymn fragment forecloses all other possibilities. Cost is visible in Aris’s last breath and Elara’s pulsing stillness. Agency is Elara’s curatorial attention; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of release versus medical intervention emerges organically from Elara’s tactics; the scent of hope shifts from memory to present-tense atmosphere without authorial comment. Final image of warm shard + lavender reweights the premise: healing can be letting go. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“low cello note,” “dead wax”) is character-specific and rhythmic. Compression and patterned elision (“hiss-click” chant) are taught early and paid off in the closing stillness. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“scent of hope” repeated in close proximity—dulls the edge slightly. Otherwise rhythm, clarity, and propulsion are exemplary; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: hospice music therapy + broken vinyl as sacrament transforms a familiar deathbed scene. Risky choice to hinge climax on a single fractured note pays off emotionally. Specificity of rooftop ritual prevents it from feeling like template grief porn.</comment>
