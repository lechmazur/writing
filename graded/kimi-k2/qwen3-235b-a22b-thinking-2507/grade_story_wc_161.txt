<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradictions (once-forger now curator) embody cost in tremulous fingers and the moment she chooses imperfect trust; Earned Stasis cleanly lands. Only slight slack in pigeons as emotional extensions rather than agents.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accrued/Textural lens is consistent from dust-mote lessons to the final weighted attic hush; closure arrives via Charged Poise—choice to release Hermes reconfigures risk of loss and moral identity—felt cost on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Bookshop attic is palpably evoked: skylight, rafters, ledgers, pigeon loft. These props subtly guide choice—dust motes serve balance practice, rafters enable pigeon launch—charging the final image, though environment itself does not constrain last beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve sonic ghosts without breaking them) is signalled early; pressure tightens once via the single decisive transfer to Hermes. Cost—irreplaceable history might vanish—is visibly weighed at the moment of release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of trusting memory’s imperfect preservation versus forgery’s curated lies emerges through specific action, not exposition. Releasing the bird offers quiet reweighting: “The songs weren’t truly lost; they lived in careful hands,” a resonant non-moral closing image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet concrete; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s sensory precision. No dialogue; internal monologue stays specific. Occasional elevated cadence (“blooming scent… inevitable loss”) edges ornate without obscuring. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is densely textured, rhythmically varied, information-rich. One line repeats “dust motes spinning,” minor template cadence; otherwise lines advance multipurpose. Final image gleams clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Mars phonograph sonics, pigeon courier ethics, dust-mote mindfulness training is entirely integrated; trope of former-forger seeking redemption transformed by exact stakes of sound memory. Concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
