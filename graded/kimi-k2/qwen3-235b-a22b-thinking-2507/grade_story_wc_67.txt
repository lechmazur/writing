<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers tracing the mask, the throat-tightening awe—yet the final renunciation (“leaving the gallery to its quiet end”) feels slightly under-motivated; the mask’s weight is noted but never forces a micro-choice that costs her something visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each scattering beat layers density until the ash spiral folds into the vanishing point, achieving Charged Poise with felt cost—the gallery’s dissolution and her own exile. One minor slack: the diary page is introduced late and not woven into the causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The vanishing-point floor lines and rocking chair’s final halt are not mere backdrop; they physically guide the ash spiral and mark the ticking clock, constraining her last ritual. High specificity, no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—crystallizing Eleanor’s emotion before the gallery dies—is clear from the first paragraph. Escalation is accretive: each pinch of ash tightens the sense of ending. Cost is legible in the gallery’s closure and her exile, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of safety as fragile mirage emerges organically from ash, mask, and vanishing point; no moralizing. Final image of ash already fading reweights the premise: love persists only as transient trace. Elegant, resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm—“ghostly embrace,” “quiet awe of endings”—and perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s tactile ritual. No POV drift; compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence advances image or stakes. One minor loop: “mirage of safety” appears three times with slight paraphrase—does not dull closure. Otherwise clean, propulsive, vivid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: portrait-ash ritual as elegy for impermanence, porcelain mask as literalized broken safety. Risky lyric structure holds; no derivative echoes. Could edge higher with one more specific detail anchoring Eleanor beyond “single diary page.”</comment>
