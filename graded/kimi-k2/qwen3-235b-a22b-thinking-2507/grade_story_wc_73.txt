<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s grim optimism is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb on the chipped die, whispered axiom, final descent—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interior contradiction (math vs regret) is dramatized, not summarized, and the Earned Stasis of turning away from the void carries visible cost. Minor slip: “balancedly daring” is asserted more than enacted until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Aris refuses the rupture and descends, reconfiguring missed opportunity into foundation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break (die strike → void) reweights the stake with felt cost. Causality is tight: every beat advances texture-capture or proof-testing. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Infinite staircase is not backdrop but antagonist: steps vanish, regenerate, dictate tactics. Micro-setting (chipped die as entropy node) constrains the rupture equation. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under crisis. Final descent recharges the staircase’s grain as compass—setting becomes thematic engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of refusal—is signaled early and tightened by each failed proof. Escalation is one decisive intensification: rupture offers escape, but true cost is recreating hesitation. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (die roll) but does not resolve. Price is the perpetual descent itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: missed opportunity is not the door but the suspended breath before refusal. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing—texture now compass, confinement now hope. Subtext in the dice’s fate (perfect one discarded, flawed one retained) crystallizes the paradox. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet haunted, syntax tightening under pressure. Perceptual signature filters every detail through proof-logic and tactile regret. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional crests. “Balancedly daring” is the only phrase that edges toward label-speak, but context earns it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture, stakes, or equation. Metaphors (shattering glass, cool silk) are selective and paid off. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates into rupture, then breathes at the edge. Minor register lift in “harmonic resonance” fits POV’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—mathematical escape from infinite regret—feels inevitable yet fresh. Dice as entropy engine and texture-capture as stake transform familiar metaphysics into lived dilemma. Risk of abstraction is countered by embodied detail. Final inversion (descent as liberation) is earned, not gimmick.</comment>
