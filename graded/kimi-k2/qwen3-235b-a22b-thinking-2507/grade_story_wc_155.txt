<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s arc from hollow artist to purposeful bearer of rescued light is sharply embodied. The contradiction between abandoning pigment for loss and now reclaiming light is dramatized through micro-choice: the trembling hands loading flawed film, then pressing the switch to resurrect laughter. Her grandmother’s remembered line is earned as causality because the knowledge it encodes yields the closure projector decision; the cost felt is the tear-stained grime on her cheeks. Only a hairline slip: we do not see her decide to come back on subsequent days—the plan is stated rather than crystallized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens dominates because each beat is linked: grandmother’s fragment triggers memory of “paints with light;” memory triggers salvaging the projector; knowledge network dictates seeing accidental exposure as latent treasure instead of ruin; final beam projects the ghost dance that makes district remembrance inevitable. Closure is an Earned Stasis: Elara chooses a new daily vigil with felt cost—“the weight in her hands replaced by the lightness of purpose.” One transition in shards (wandering orchard → crumbling wall → projection site) stays legible within the fog-fold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Moss-choked earth, dense fog, and crumbling wall anchor place, body, and immediate danger to footing. The fog wall itself becomes the moving canvas; the stone fragment becomes anchor and relic in hand. These details constrain choice: fog thickness dictates where Elara must aim the beam, and the relic weight decides she will return. Only minor slippage: apple-blanched childhood is invoked rather than re-sensed in body, so spatial grounding wavers slightly at childhood recall.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rediscover lost joy—is signaled from sentence two. Escalation is one tightening turn: abandoned pigment → discovered fragment → recovered “paints with light.” Each step shrinks viable joy sources until the final beam is the only live option. Cost is tactile: grime on skin, tremor in projector grip, and the new obligation of daily vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme emerges in inverse: ruin is medium, decay is memory’s cradle, joy is not retrieved but remade through deliberate re-exposure. The conceptual reprise—“Joy wasn’t a destination... but reaching through the mist”—serves as a restrained Conceptual Repricing without sermonizing. No tidy moral, only a lived equation of loss + light = responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Vivid third-person close stays with Elara; free-indirect diction—“her mentor’s studio, salvaged”—matches her memory-hungry perception. Rhythm leans on lyric echoes (“folded time... watercolors in the rain”), but they are patterned and purposeful, not decorative. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction checks void.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive; no loops or artifact scaffold except two adjacent “light” metaphors nearly stack. Strong concrete verbs—“she unslung,” “beacon in the fog,” “fog seemed thinner”—carry motion. Only slight overwatch in the closing line—“gathered the fresco fragment gently, cradling it like a promise”—skates toward sentiment, but tears-in-grime physicality just balances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>“Paint with light using exposed film recovered from fog-ruin to rekindle collective memory” is a fresh synthesis of archival-photography meets orchard elegy. Risk—leveraging flawed accidental exposure as generative—pays off; no close echoes in contemporary short forms. The district becoming a living screen is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
