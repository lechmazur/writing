<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s drive to “excavate truth” is embodied in every micro-choice—scanning trunks, kneeling to brush grit, using the diamond as a sorting surface. The interior contradiction between her rational dismissal of “curses” and the visceral weight of the stone is dramatized, not labeled. The final renunciation—leaving the diamond yet carrying the letters—earns its cost through prior causality and visibly forecloses the path of comfortable ignorance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (scan → dig → reassemble → decide) is linked by “because/therefore” logic. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the orchard’s hum becomes “deafening” as Lena shoulders the heavier pack, a felt cost that reweights every prior image. No orientation drift; anchors (dust storm, orchard, stillpoint) are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s impossible green against ochre dust is not backdrop but constraint: the stillpoint’s calm pocket literally enables the reassembly work. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—radioactive grit on respirator, cool density of diamond—guiding choice. Final image of Lena walking “into the storm” recharges the opening wasteland with new conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. comfortable lies—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when “Initiate Verdant Protocol” proves the lie. One meaningful escalation: the orchard shifts from miracle to engineered crime scene, narrowing Lena’s options to carry the evidence out. Cost is visceral: the pack’s new weight and the orchard’s suddenly “deafening” quiet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the “curse” is a social fiction masking calculated sacrifice. Subtext operates in the diamond’s spiderweb crack—flaw as stabilizer, not wrath. Final image offers non-literal answer: truth itself becomes the heavier stone she now bears, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sharp, compressed, and consistent—conspiracy debunker’s diction (“excavate truth,” “comfortable lies”) without slipping into jargon. Perceptual signature is selective: Lena notices pattern breaks (stillness at the heart) and archival echoes. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (“Hour bled into hour”) then crystallizes in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “ochre clouds swallowing the dying sun” does double sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful, and never muddies causality. Final line lands clean with resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard seeded with terraforming tech is a fresh synthesis; the “curse” as crowd-control myth transforms a stock trope. Specificity—peach rows now “gnarled apple trees, impossibly green”—anchors the concept. Risky compression (no dialogue, single scene) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
