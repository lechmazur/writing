<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is elegant and embodied—"lurch in her stomach", "latent blaze of ancient purpose". Micro-choice to trace the doodle and to copy the patterns shows hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses are faint, so the arc feels lightly earned rather than wrung; renunciation is implicit but final image reframes rather than sacrifices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: doodle leads to grotto at exactly the inversion that reveals the chamber-floor symbols, time snap-back closes the loop. Closure satisfies: she carries seeds—an earned shift—though cost is abstract (knowledge weight) rather than physical. Gravity window is the single rule the story never breaks; lens stays Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mist, floating pebbles, inverted ceiling-floor all constrain movement and observation. The "serpent grotto" is never static—air shimmers with threshold effects that literally permit reentry. Environment coherently feeds the final charge: inverted stone becomes the only place symbols can be read. Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locating and transmitting the seeds—crystallizes within an unforgiving hourglass; gravity clock ratchets pressure. Agency is decisive: every float, kick-off, and ink stroke narrows options to a single copy window. Final "carry the flame" crystallizes trade-off: knowledge vs solitude, though physical price is light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Vigilance emerges organically from the story’s concrete ritual—harvest under gravity inversion. Final quiet revolution (no manifesto) reweights “seed into blaze” without sermonizing. Sentimentality is avoided by cost framed as long memory rather than triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Distinct prism-science diction—“prism mind refracted the problem” etc.—persists throughout. Rhythmic compression under gravity zero-G beats is controlled; no filter-verb slush. Compression “a sound like a closing eye” nails auditory closure within single POV voice. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Line compression tight: “the mist clinging like second skin” followed immediately by pressure beat. Only minor figurative pile-ups during mid-descent—“counterintuitive eddies” skirts excess. No loops or scaffold; propulsion remains until final blaze mention.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Inversion-as-clock and margin-doodle-as-map feel fresh within familiar secret-archive genre. Gravity physics and clandestine fluorescence synthesize into specific ritual rather than gimmick. Final stance—keeper to city blaze—grows from prior seeds without feeling forced.</comment>
