<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s compulsive seed-sorting ritual and reverence for life’s encoded language are embodied with precision; her final pivot from preservation to prophetic curation earns a drastic, credible change, foreclosing the safe “archivist” path and igniting forest-wide resurrection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot moves on a cleanly causal spine: ash-sickness → cipher-leaf → moonstone revelation → monument-building → living green return; each beat tightens options until the haze parts with irrevocable starlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is rendered through tactile specificity—pollen dust on fingertips, grey bark like “old bones,” moss clinging to beams—and its choking haze supplies both obstacle to breathing and the sole resource (time) Elara must out-race.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central conflict escalates from individual ritual to ecological exorcism; each carved memorial is a deliberate, irreversible sacrifice of precious seeds, narrowing her chances of future abundance, charging the climax with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as ecological salvation—emerges from tangible acts: sorting seeds binds her to every forgotten species; monuments transform grief into literally emergent green shoots, avoiding sermon by letting chlorophyll speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical, plant-tuned diction (“falling leaves, the only language left from the world before the ash”) stays rooted in sensory perception; no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance, rhythmic control under duress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence texture alternates between breathy elongation and propulsive compression; no glued templates or synonym loops, rich imagery balanced with clarity (pheasant-silenced fields, orchid-spore arches) without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Folk device—seed sets decoded by moonstone shard—feels inevitable; no close echoes of other ash-forest stories, and the final constellation/green-break payoff re-weights prior ash with cost and wonder.</comment>
