<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“salt dust on the lattice,” “copperlight repose”); the boy’s contradictory impulses—fear of being blamed vs. need to vanish—drive every beat. Micro-choices (leaning into the confessional, folding the lattice into his tunic) reveal value hierarchy. The final renunciation of his father’s voice lands with felt cost, though the shift from grounded fear to magical buoyancy slightly dilutes credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy’s escape into “copper-dark sea” reweights the inherited lie and reconfigures identity. Causal chain holds—father’s false alarms → guards’ distrust → boy’s flight—until the magical hover, which is taught early via the beam’s “ancient magic.” Cost is legible: he forfeits home, name, and safety. One minor ellipsis: how the lattice enables buoyancy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lighthouse, reef, and confessional are rendered with tactile specificity; the copper beam itself becomes a tool that enables escape, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; the reef’s “jagged teeth” mirror the boy’s trap. Salt, iron, and spray are filtered through POV urgency. Only the monastery backstory drifts into static exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“before they find the bodies”—is signaled early and tightens with each beat. Escalation is situational: rising tide reveals corpses, guards converge, options narrow. The boy’s agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the cost is exile. One tightening turn suffices, though external pressure slightly outweighs internal dilemma in the final third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt and the impossibility of inherited innocence emerges through concrete particulars—lattice, beam, reef—never abstract assertion. Final image of vanishing into “copper-dark sea” offers a non-literal answer: silence as self-forged identity. Subtext in the confessional’s “whispered secrets” resonates without moralizing. No thematic drift or late exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“threaded the labyrinth with his own story”). Perceptual signature is consistent: the boy notices salt, iron, light angles, and silence. No POV leakage or register drift. Compression and elision (“he didn’t walk; he began to hover”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“reef’s teeth,” “copperlight repose”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter verbs (“he remembered”) are voice-motivated and sparse. Final cadence slows to crystallize the escape without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale premise is inverted: the boy of the liar must flee a truth no one will believe. The lattice-beam fusion transforms a confessional relic into a vehicle of flight, a synthesis that feels inevitable. Specificity of salt-dusted lattice and copper beam anchors universals. Risk-taking (magical buoyancy) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
