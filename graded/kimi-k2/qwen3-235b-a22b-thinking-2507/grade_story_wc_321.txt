<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Leo’s internal contradiction—trembling yet urgent—drives every on-page beat, culminating in the earned renunciation that keeps him forever at the grotto’s edge. His micro-choice to empty the hourglass and embrace eternal transience visibly costs him any future normal life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: empty hourglass signals closing window → Leo uses radio → triple horn blast → lattice convergence → ferry re-forms → Leo stays. Closure is a credible Earned Stasis that forecloses his escape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is more than backdrop; the star-lit tide pools directly provide the tri-star pattern that dictates radio tuning. Time's sideways flow physically forces Leo’s micro-adaptations and the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore safe waterway passage—steadily narrows to one live option: merge timelines or never reach home. The tightening radio exchange dramatizes the irreversible cost as Leo trades permanent exile for collective safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “light between fractures” emerges through the charged image of liquid starlight filling the hollow hourglass; no overt statement required. Ambiguity lingers: Leo’s optimism may be salvation or tragic denial, handled without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent ferry-hand cadence: clipped maritime diction, sensory compression, rhythmic bursts matching urgency. Distinct perceptual tilt—“sideways-ticking clocks,” “moths against cavern walls”—anchors the singular POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, varied rhythm, high density: “liquid starlight snapped timelines together.” Few boilerplate repeats; every image tightens pressure. No figurative muddle under stress; clarity survives the lyrical flourishes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The collapsing-ferry-into-grotto conceit feels organically new; the sideways-time mechanic isn’t gimmick but intrinsic to the stakes. Transformation test passes—swapping any element breaks the closure logic.</comment>
