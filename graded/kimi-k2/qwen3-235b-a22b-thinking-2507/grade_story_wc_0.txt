<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interior contradiction—hunger for quiet truth vs. career pressure for spectacle—is embodied in her tactile mapping of dust; the final renunciation of “needless drama” carries visible cost as she seals the vial and walks away from prior ambition. Micro-choices (kneeling, tracing, closing notebook) align with motive and foreclose the path of self-aggrandizing science. Reflection stays anchored in present cues and tilts her stance. No second character on page, so relationship bullets N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via “preprocessing reality” and held to the end: density of dust layers parallels pulsar decay, culminating in Charged Poise—notebook closed, vial sealed, stance reconfigured. Closure beat (“weight of forced narratives lifting”) reweights prior material with felt cost. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse ruin is vivid, selective, and purposeful: broken glass, mildew, mud-caked benches constrain her movement and focus attention to micro-detail. The butterfly-wing shard and dust patterns function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her scientific gaze narrowing under pressure. Weather leaks reinforce decay motif without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—strip needless drama from perception—signaled early. Escalation is textural: accumulation of dust layers tightens the stake by revealing slow, inevitable change as the true story. One decisive intensification when she maps decay and chooses patience over spectacle; cost is the relinquished prestige of grand narratives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of gradualism emerges organically from dust mapping and neutron-star physics; no explicit moralizing. Final image of vial-as-compass offers non-literal answer that reweights earlier motifs. Subtext operates in the silence after the flood and the quiet surrender of the orchid. Complexity preserved—no tidy binary between drama and truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision filtered through grief and humility. Syntax mirrors methodical observation—long, layered sentences during reflection, crisp fragments at moments of decision. No dialogue; free indirect style stays clean. Register consistent with astrophysicist POV without jargon overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or insight. Figurative language (“quiet contribution to the cycle of decay”) is earned and precise. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: using post-flood greenhouse micro-decay to illuminate astrophysical gradualism. Butterfly-wing dust as cosmic tracer feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative templates.</comment>
