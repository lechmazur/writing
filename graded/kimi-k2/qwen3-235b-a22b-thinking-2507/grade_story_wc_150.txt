<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—archival precision vs. instinctive listening—play out in embodied micro-choices (cleaning the stone, fitting the gnomon). The final act of restoration carries visible cost: Kael’s tears mark the price of remembering. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; exile’s ache is rendered through loam scent and root-bone entanglement rather than labels. One slip: “warmly curious” is asserted more than dramatized in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s shadow re-starts ancestral time, foreclosing exile’s drift. Causal linkage is tight—wandering → pattern recognition → gnomon placement—each step narrowing options toward the single irrevocable click. Orientation is anchored by orchard gate and loam within 60 words. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural design holds from decay scent to final charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is no backdrop: roots gripping bones physically constrain where Elara can step, guiding her to the buried sundial. Weathered stone markers and olive canopy filter light that later calibrates the restored gnomon. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound—decay-sweet apples trigger diaspora memory, narrowing perception to what matters for restoration. One minor drift: “damp earth” repeats scent register.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore severed faith—is signaled at gate and tightened when the sundial’s shadow reclaims time. Escalation is accretive: each wandering beat deepens pattern knowledge until the final fitting forecloses exile’s inertia. Cost is legible in Kael’s tears and the irreversible click that binds Elara to ancestral rhythm. No coincidence resolves; pressure is purely situational and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical return emerges from roots embracing bones and time reasserting itself, never stated outright. The sundial’s resurrection reframes exile as pause, not rupture—an earned non-moral insight. Subtext lives in Kael’s silence and the shadow’s first sweep. Final image reweights earlier decay into tentative renewal without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: loam scent, root-tangle, light angles. Syntax lengthens during wandering to mimic slow absorption, then tightens at the click. Dialogue is spare, subtextual—Kael’s murmured recognition carries more weight than exposition. No POV leakage; diction remains diaspora-returnee, never academic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “gnarled roots snaking between exposed bones” does triple sensory and symbolic work. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long reflective sentences during wandering, staccato at the click. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances restoration or memory. One mixed metaphor—“faith fractured by exile”—slips through but does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: diaspora return meets catacomb orchard meets astronomical timepiece, all braided through tactile restoration. The seed-shaped gnomon transforms familiar sundial trope into living metaphor. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off: no spectacle, only shadow reclaiming time. Specificity of olive roots threading bones anchors universals of displacement and return.</comment>
