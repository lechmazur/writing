<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is distinctive—embodied through rosin-dusted fingers and tuning-fork choices—but late summary softens some beats; micro-choice chain supports closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal arc intact: fork test → response → breakthrough → earned renunciation (diary clasp now superfluous). Closure lands with on-page cost: she abandons ownership of the diary. Lens remains Causal without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Workshop and diary function as micro-setting; the brass clasp physically constrains decision. Sensory specificity guides action—cold brass against lip, star-gleam on lenses—supporting stakes without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear: gain grandmother’s last entry. Each fork attempt escalates failure cost; the final success forecloses further pursuit by rendering the lock meaningless—visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy-through-listening emerges from concrete beats (failed note, final resonance) rather than assertion, culminating in shared town hush under fireworks. Image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile brass vocabulary, musical cadence, sensory selectivity. No POV drift; voice modulates under pressure. Rhythm is controlled and propulsive; elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm and economy; minor phrase repetition (“silence of…”) accumulates across lines yet becomes pattern that earns closure context. No clarity-dulling figurative muddle at peak.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion: musical pacifism + frequency-lock diary + listening-as-warfare. Trope inversion feels inevitable because stakes remain grounded; late silence-bloom image synthesizes prior motifs under pressure.</comment>
