<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for song yet clinging to the fortress’s slow healing—are embodied in the bolt’s weight and her final bow. The interiority is specific, but the “seraphically mundane” label edges toward diagnostic shorthand. Micro-choice to place the bolt on the piano earns the Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bolt discovery deepens pattern, reweights silence from abstract to tangible cost. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s bow crystallizes her stance, cost legible in the bolt left behind. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt walls and snow press inward, constraining exit; bolt and staircase function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—ochre smudge against blue stone—filtered through Elara’s tactile search. Environment subtly guides her choice to stay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice vs safety—tightens when bolt forces reckoning with past silence. One meaningful deepening: bolt transforms silence from abstract loss to concrete debt. Cost is felt in the bolt’s placement; no reversal, but pressure crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety’s price is the exile of joy. Subtext lives in gesture—bow, bolt placement—never sermon. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; silence’s cost made undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“cobalt fortress groaning under snow”). Perceptual signature is Elara’s tactile, soundless world. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to pattern. Minor loop: “seraphically mundane” repeats conceptually. No artifacts in closure beat; rhythm breathes with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: choir-silence, nerve-regeneration, and fortress as penitentiary. Bolt as relic of lost music feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk in lyric stillness pays off in charged final image.</comment>
