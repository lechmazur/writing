<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-muteness and tactile devotion to decaying wood are embodied in every motion; the moment he parts his lips to sing, the contradiction between years of silence and sudden voiced hope is palpable, paid for by tears and trembling breath. The micro-choice to kneel and hum carries visible cost—he risks the only identity he has left. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; interiority alone suffices and is sharply particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the halo fragment’s glow becomes permanent song-light, foreclosing Elias’s exile in silence. Causal chain—wrong turn → oasis → fragment → song → sustained light—holds without gaps; wind-bell chime provides the tightening clock. Cost is on-page: “tears tracking through the grime” and the final, irreversible smile that ends his muteness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of decay vs. luminous oasis reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned circus detritus is filtered through Elias’s carpenter eye—splintered zebra paint, rusted boxcars, moss-velveted stone—each detail constrains movement and mood. The halo fragment itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate; fog and wind bells create a tactile clock. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can silence be transmuted into living sound without losing the self forged in grief? Pressure tightens once: wind-bell chime marks the closing window; failure to sing means permanent exile in muteness. Escalation is accretive—each sensory detail thickens the cost of remaining silent. The final note forecloses muteness; cost is the reopening of a wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges: silence is not absence but unshaped possibility; only by risking voice can possibility root. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers on wood, throat opening after years—never in exposition. Final image of warm fragment and awaiting carousel horses reweights earlier decay without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: song heals yet exposes grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains welded to Elias’s carpenter sensorium; diction is tactile, rhythmic, slightly archaic (“misting hush,” “burial shrouds”) yet consistent. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. Compression and patterned elision (“the timeframe ending”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language is selective (“woven from captured starlight”) and never muddles causality. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences in fog, short bursts at climax. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—mute artisan, magical object—are transformed through specific craft detail and the inversion that song, not carpentry, repairs the fragment. The abandoned circus is rendered with idiosyncratic precision; no interchangeable setting. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration of light.</comment>
