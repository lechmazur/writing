<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s grief is embodied in trembling fingers and the vial’s weight; his interior contradiction—clinging to scent while fearing its cost—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (“broker no more lanterns”) is earned by the Bloom’s revelation and carries visible cost. Only a slight drift toward abstract interiority near the climax keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (lantern glow, pollen risk, scent molecules) tightens the emotional density until the Bloom’s ultraviolet flare reconfigures memory itself. Closure is a Charged Poise—Silas recorks the vial, lanterns flicker, path foreclosed with felt cost. No causality breaks; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but pressure system: Moonpetal pollen forces cautious footwork, lantern glow limits visibility, Kauri decay thickens air. The crystal vial and Bloom together function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Only the brief exterior memory of “rain on cobblestones” momentarily dilutes spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover Elara’s scent memory—tightens once: the ultraviolet revealing proves memory can be restored yet devastates with irretrievable loss. Agency is Silas’s decision to recork and stay; cost is the renunciation of further brokering. Pressure escalates via sensory density, not external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the Bloom’s revelation: memory is synesthetic, stored in the heart, not the nose. Subtext lives in the vial’s weight and the lanterns’ flicker—no moralizing, only the ache of recognition. Final image reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and grief-tinged: “calloused from decades handling fragile glass,” “dust-filmed glass panes.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through Silas’s professional caution and longing. No POV drift; compression and elision serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data without redundancy. Metaphors (“crystal shadows danced…like fractured memories”) are earned and coherent. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he understood now”) slightly dull immediacy at peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bioluminescent lanterns + extinct flora + scent-memory science fiction, grounded in one man’s grief. The ultraviolet reveal feels inevitable yet surprising. No derivative echoes; risk-taking (synesthetic grief) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
