<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradictions—“precise geometric patterns” against the bodily tremor of sinew—are shown through tactile choices; the final braid with the stranger crystallizes a cost exact enough to foreclose the tidy craft she sought. Only minor slip: “discover the texture” drifts toward theme-claim in a single phrase.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the gallery stilled but “threaded with truth,” the visible price of shared pain absorbed into the lattice. Causal chain never breaks; each knot tightens choice until final image reweights memory itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective sensory anchors—“charcoal-gray floor,” “ozone and old paper”—guide micro-movements and constrain final weave. Gallery as breathing body and sinew as conduit charge closure yet refrain from over-cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—feel connection’s true texture—escalates when the client gasps “It hurts,” forcing Elara to trade perfect craft for shared suffering. One decisive tightening: kneel-and-braid with stranger; no resolution off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the braid itself: connection is sinew—resistant, torn, healed—without any explicit moral. Final image of gallery “threaded with truth” reweights preceding patterns without stating the lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Narrative voice controlled compression—syntax tightens under rising pressure; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: sinew “vibrating with the energy of altered recollection” teaches the reader the bodily cost of rational enchantment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Density remains high—“memory brush another’s,” “gallery breathed on”—but momentary drift toward elevated diction (“rational enchantment” as label) nudges down. Rhythm, clarity, and prop track are otherwise clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving memory into optical space; the fever-dream-architect conceit avoids generic tropes. Risk-taking (illusion as bodily braid) heightens stakes and resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
