<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—grief vs. need for self-definition—play out in micro-choices (thermal trick, moonbeam jar). The final renunciation (she doesn’t steal, she listens) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “luminous disbelief” edges toward label-speak at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the map blooms behind her eyes, the hum names her. Causal chain holds—each beat (thermal trick, code read, descent) tightens options toward Track 13. Cost is legible in the tear-blurred vision and the irreversible step through the rusted door.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The emerald station’s glass roof and mineral air constrain tactics (thermal expansion trick, moonbeam necessity). Micro-setting—the jar, the pedestal rose—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the floral message to find self—is signaled early and tightens once: Platform Zero, Track 13. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (fresh rose) but does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible step into the forgotten tunnel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief transmuted into self-recognition via floral code. Final image (ear to stone, hearing her name in the hum) offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in the moonbeam pulse and white rose is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s light-obsessed lens. Syntax modulates with pressure—long cadences in golden hour, clipped descent into tunnel. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor mixed metaphor (“molten sliver of sun vanishing”) but clarity intact. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: art-heist frame inverted into mystical self-portrait via botanical cryptography. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant closure. Specificity of emerald station, moonbeam jar, and floral code feels inevitable, not ornamental.</comment>
