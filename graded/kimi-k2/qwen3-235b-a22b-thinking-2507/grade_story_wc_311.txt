<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and reaper identity are embodied in tactile ritual; the micro-choice to crystallize echoes rather than reap souls shows a clear, costly shift. Interior contradiction—duty vs. love—surfaces in the moment she whispers the named fears, not in abstract summary. The earned stasis (carrying crystals instead of souls) is scaled to the word count and feels inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas page’s monsters become companions, crystallized fears in her palm. Causal chain holds—Kael’s dictum “to name the voids is to disarm them” motivates the ritual; the act reweights her reaper identity with felt cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by word 90. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density of echoes tightens to final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory dome fractures and prismatic light actively constrain the ritual; the obsidian slab and scattered beams are micro-settings that charge the final crystallization. Sensory selection is urgent—cold stone, warm crystals—mirroring internal thaw. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into named fears—tightens once when she chooses crystallization over reaping. Pressure grows via accumulating whispers; the final crystallization narrows her future path (she now carries named terrors, not souls). Cost is visible: the void “felt less like an abyss,” a reconfiguration with lingering weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: naming disarms fear, love’s echo outlasts death. Subtext lives in the shift from “phantoms” to “companions.” Final image of crystals against palm offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (echo, atlas, light) reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; perceptual signature is Elara’s reaper-biased noticing (inked kraken under thumb, dust motes refracting). Syntax lengthens under grief, compresses during ritual, matching pulse. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Free indirect style clean: “she believed she could crystallize” stays within her ken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; “brittle edge of atlas page,” “prismatic shards across the floor” advance atmosphere without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (kraken as fears) remain coherent. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—long sentences for dusk bleed, clipped ones for crystal formation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: reaper performs anti-reaping, turning cartographic monsters into named crystals. Sacrifice-as-echo concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (ochre kraken, wax cylinders) prevents template drift. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in final image.</comment>
