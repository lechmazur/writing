<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s sensory-mapping vocation is embodied in every beat; the shard’s bite and the hydraulic arm’s near-miss anchor her interiority in physical stakes. The final renunciation—accepting Lyra’s sacrifice—earns its weight through prior sensory threads and the shard’s extinguished light. Minor slip: “crushing pressure” is slightly diagnostic, but immediately re-embodied in the closing gravity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard’s cold extinction reweights the entire quest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the implosion reconfigures meaning. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (gantry, console, coolant pool) remain legible throughout folds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bay’s rust, ozone, and strobing red lights are not backdrop but instruments: the hydraulic arm’s swing and coolant leak directly constrain Elara’s ghost-body and redirect her path. Micro-setting (the shard against the console) charges the final image. One minor spatial blur during the fold—knee-deep coolant appears without transition—but the sensory cue (“viscous”) re-anchors instantly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth—tightens when the vision reveals Lyra’s self-redirect. Pressure escalates via spontaneous bleed-throughs that cost Elara physical risk (near-miss arm) and ontological instability. The final tightening is Lyra’s silent command, foreclosing rescue and crystallizing cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Sacrifice versus betrayal emerges through sensory particulars, never thesis. The jasmine-scented ghost of Lyra reappears as the cost of containment, reweighting love as gravitational burden. Final image—Elara clutching the dead shard—offers resonant, non-moral answer: carry the weight forward.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, synesthetic, and urgent: “ghost-vibration of ozone,” “kaleidoscope of overlapping sensations.” Compression and elision are taught early (“world dissolved”) and paid off in the silent implosion. No POV leakage; even Lyra’s unheard words are filtered through Elara’s sensory ghosting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “dust motes danced…humming with residual chroniton decay” fuses image and exposition. Metaphors stay coherent under pressure; “wounded heart” for dimensional instability is earned by prior bleed-throughs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Weaving-between-worlds as sensory perception rather than portal travel is fresh and fully committed. The green glass shard’s evolution from key to extinguished relic transforms a familiar quest into a meditation on irreversible sacrifice. Risky structure—lyric folds instead of linear beats—heightens coherence.</comment>
