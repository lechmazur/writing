<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—shame vs. communion—surface in the charcoal tremor and the pivot toward Polaris; the cost of exile is felt, but the interiority drifts toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glimpse of Polaris crystallizes her stance, reweights the premise, and forecloses the path of self-blame; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the machinery’s failure is slightly under-explained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The deck’s dilated twilight and the compass rose constrain every sketching choice; the final image of Polaris refracted through the applique charges the closure with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the family custom before dilation fades—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Polaris appears, forcing a decisive reorientation with visible cost of continued solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of finding anchoring constants amid chaos emerges organically from the sketching ritual and Polaris revelation; no moralizing, only a charged image that reweights prior shame into purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to slowed star-drifts; rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping, and consistent psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional poetic layering risks overwriting yet never muddles causality; zero loops or scaffold in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of time-dilation grief and astronomical ritual; the Polaris-through-compass conceit feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming exile into vocation.</comment>
