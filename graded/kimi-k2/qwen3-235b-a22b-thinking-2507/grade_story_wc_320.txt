<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots ring, her palms thrum—yet the final choice to “tune herself to the hush” arrives with only a conceptual cost; the felt price is implied rather than dramatized, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: lunar perigee → anomaly → shard → retuning the array → hearing the cosmic lullaby. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the tower groaning and the gorge swirling—visible stakes and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted gantry, mist-filled gorge, and glass control bubble are rendered with sensory economy; the shard’s shimmer and tower’s groan constrain Elara’s final tuning, charging the closure image. One notch shy of 9 only because the gorge itself doesn’t directly alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the cosmic lullaby before perigee ends—tightens once when Elara discards filtering and retunes the array. The cost is the tower’s structural stress and the irreversible shift in her perception, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of “beginning in every ending” emerges organically from the physics of stellar collapse and nebula birth; the final tone reweights prior static as language without moralizing. Subtext hums in the shard’s silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and POV-locked: “serenely electric,” “shard of hush.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor register drift (“cosmic lullaby”) is earned by context and does not dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of radio astronomy, Hollywood myth, and cosmic rebirth feels inevitable and fresh. The shard of a literal star repurposed as tuning key is a non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
