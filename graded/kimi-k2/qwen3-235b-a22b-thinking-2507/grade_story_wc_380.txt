<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is specific—pressed wildflowers as memory anchors, salt-sting eyes, trembling hands—and his contradictory impulse (fear of forgetting vs. fear of exhuming) is dramatized in the act of scraping salt. The final renunciation—empty hands, brimming heart—earns its cost via the mother’s journal and the zero-gravity unfurling of petals. Only the mother’s voice edges toward explanatory; a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gravity pockets shift from thieves to keepers, visible in the suspended memory fragments and unfurling petals. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases until the salt chamber “breathes” and releases. Causality is intact: coffee-ground pattern → dig → chest → journal → release. Cost is legible in the empty hands and the irrevocable mingling of flowers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt chamber’s crystalline lattice literally constrains the final choice—Aris must kneel, scrape, and place flowers at the base of the largest crystal. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: brine stings, dust motes pinned or lifted by gravity pockets. Spatial choreography is clean; the lantern’s fractured glow tracks with Aris’s movement. One hairline slip: “gleaming silence” is repeated without new inflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—is signaled early and tightened when the gravity pockets surge to release rather than steal. One meaningful deepening: the mother’s journal reframes the pockets as memory wells, forcing Aris to decide whether to reclaim or release. Cost is visible in the emptied chest and the irreversible mingling of flowers. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of exhuming: memory is not erased but transformed, held in salt until someone dares to release it. Subtext lives in the wildflowers—first as fragile relic, then as shared offering. The final image (petals unfurling in zero gravity) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: the whale’s death is both sacrifice and invitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in tactile detail: “chipped porcelain tray,” “salt-encrusted floor.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer clauses during reflection, clipped fragments during scraping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Aris notices gravity shifts through bodily tug and lantern sway. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. One micro-slip: “gleaming silence” risks abstraction but is earned by prior usage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise: “reality thinned like worn fabric.” No loops or scaffold; sentence openings vary. One near-miss: “gleaming silence” appears twice; the second use gains new charge but edges close to repetition. Rhythm accelerates during the dig, then exhales in the final release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The memory-well concept feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized through salt crystals and gravity pockets rather than generic fantasy. The whale’s voluntary surrender of memory reframes beaching as ritual, not tragedy. Specificity—pressed wildflowers, coffee-ground divination—grounds the speculative frame. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
