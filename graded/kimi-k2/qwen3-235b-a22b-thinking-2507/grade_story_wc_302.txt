<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s drive, internal contradiction, and embodied emotion are persuasive; the cyclical reflections deepen choice pressure without becoming diagnostic self-talk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>On-page closure (reversed-watch + delay-cycle pay-off) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration; causal linkage is tight and cost (one-second collapse risk) is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Library pulses craft a living pressure chamber; micro-setting (shelves, mist, light delay) constrains tactics, and final image is charged by these physical laws.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Delay countdown escalates toward unspoken-words passage; each second lost tightens the protagonist’s options with visible stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of documentation vs. silence pulses beneath every beat, resolved in final record-keeping act without preaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct interior filter and rhythmic control under pressure; elision of exposition is earned; POV remains rooted and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zero loops, crisp diction, pulse-matching syntax; light metaphors map onto technical constraint, preserving momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh treatment of time-reversal heist tropes; cipher countdown feels organic rather than gimmick, charging the final image.</comment>
