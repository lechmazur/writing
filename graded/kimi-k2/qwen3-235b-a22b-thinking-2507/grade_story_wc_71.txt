<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied; her tactile handling of the orris root and the deliberate placement of displaced objects reveal a hierarchy of values—curiosity tempered by compassion. The final tear-touched moment on Finnegan’s porch earns her arc: she moves from detached observer to active caretaker, paying the cost of emotional exposure. Minor slip: the phrase “inadvertently profound” is stated rather than dramatized, a label rather than a lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each displaced object layers sensory density until the pattern breaks at the Finnegan house, reweighting the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the house’s faint pulse reconfigures Elara’s understanding with visible cost (her tears). One causal hiccup: the orris root’s “hushed blaze” flares without on-page trigger after the first house, but the final image absorbs it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bay’s lavender dusk, wet sand, and streetlight glow are filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; each detail narrows or widens with her focus. The orris root itself becomes micro-setting, its scent and warmth constraining her choices. Final porch image—dry grass rustling, faint internal light—charges the closure. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—tightens through successive tests; each placement narrows the mystery and raises emotional cost. The Finnegan house supplies the decisive deepening: a fragile warmth returned, not guaranteed. Cost is felt in Elara’s tears and the root’s silence—no reset, no luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete ritual: sanctification through displaced human care. The final image of the house “remembering how to breathe” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext in the hush—life as borrowed silence—avoids abstraction. Only a whisper of authorial thesis at the end keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded; syntax modulates with tidal rhythm. “Streetlights daydreamed” and “hushed blaze” teach the pattern early and pay off in the final glow. No POV drift; sensory diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Compression is purposeful, not opaque.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, or motion. Metaphors (lavender dusk, hushed blaze) are coherent and purposeful. One minor loop—“quiet life,” “quiet energy,” “quiet glow”—slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise clean, vivid, and rhythmically varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Familiar trope—houses as living memory—is transformed through the specific ritual of displaced objects and the perfumer’s orris root. The synthesis feels inevitable: sanctification by ordinary relics. Risk in lyric compression succeeds without obscuring stakes. Fresh inflection: silence as active blaze.</comment>
