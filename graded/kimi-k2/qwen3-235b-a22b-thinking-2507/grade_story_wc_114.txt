<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise, embodied, and contradictory—her “swallowed truth” and “fault-tolerant lattice” collide in the smudge moment. The final integration of guilt as unweighable yet shaping every future forecast is earned and costly. Minor: the phrase “guilt had a tangible mass” flirts with diagnostic label-speak but is immediately undercut by the smudge’s refusal to quantify.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the smudge reweights memory and forecloses the fantasy of measurable absolution. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final auroral image crystallizes cost. No causality breaks; the smudge is both accident and inevitable data.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Mountain station is visceral—iron cot, pine-snow air, auroral light bleeding across the paper. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its smudged corner literally alters what can be known. One missed beat: station’s “groans” and “avalanche rumble” stay atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—measuring the weight of guilt—tightens when the scale fails and the smudge becomes the only metric. Escalation is accretive: fever break → smudge → reconfiguration. Cost is the irreversible distortion of memory, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: error as data, memory as distortion, measurement as elegy. Final image (auroral light on smudged paper) offers non-literal answer—guilt’s mass is the space it occupies in future predictions. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, scientific yet lyric—“auroral sorrow,” “lattice designed to absorb contradictions.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s algorithmic mind: long calibrated clauses broken by the smudge’s abrupt blur. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent and pressured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances character, atmosphere, or theme. No loops, no mixed metaphors. The smudge’s description—“a single, grey blur obscuring Kael’s careful notation”—is exact and irreversible. Rhythm modulates with fever’s ebb and guilt’s surge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief refracted through metrology, error-correcting algorithms repurposed for mourning. Botanical illustration and auroral sorrow are not ornamental but structural. Risky compression pays off—no clichés, no stock mountain tropes.</comment>
