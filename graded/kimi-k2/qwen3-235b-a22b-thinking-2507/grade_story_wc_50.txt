<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise and embodied—her grief is never labeled, only felt in the “hollowed” space and the steadiness of her hands while tears threaten. The contradiction between grief and logical anchor is dramatized in the moment she chooses to tune the prism rather than indulge memory. The final act of bottling Silas’s laughter carries visible cost: she forecloses the chance to hear it again. One minor slip: “store wonder in the cellar of reason” is slightly thesis-like, though it is offset by immediate sensory follow-through.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the captured echo crystallizes into a “soft, internal glow,” reweighting the premise—wonder is now portable, but Silas’s living voice is gone. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light angle tightens the pattern until the final prism placement releases the stored sound. Cost is explicit on the page—“tears pricked her eyes” and the cavern’s last sigh marks the season’s death. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its angles and hums constrain every adjustment of the timer. Micro-setting—the workbench of stone, the quartz prisms—guides Elara’s micro-choices. Light’s shifting geometry is tracked with tactile specificity, charging the final image when the glow enters the vial. Only a hairline slip: “vaults” and “fissures” risk a faintly generic fantasy echo, but the sensory filtration keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the season’s last echo before winter silences it—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking lull. Escalation is Accumulative: each failed angle increases the pressure of time and silence. The decisive turn—tilting the prism at dusk—narrows options to one shot; the cost is the irreversible sealing of Silas’s laughter. No external antagonist needed; the wounded season itself supplies coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and loss: storing wonder also entombs it. The motif of “listening” shifts from Silas’s invitation to Elara’s solitary act, reweighted by the final glow. Subtext is carried in gesture—the steadiness of her hands against tears—never stated. The ending avoids moralizing; the resonance is felt, not explained. One minor echo of the prompt phrase “store wonder” edges toward statement, slightly blunting subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the cavern’s hush: “gears like frozen leaves, springs coiled in defeat.” Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices angles and refractions, not colors or faces. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression and elision are taught early (“the marble doesn’t remember events; it remembers feelings”) and paid off at closure. Register never drifts; diction remains within a locksmith-poet’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and function—“the marble cool and humming beneath her touch” grounds both setting and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during adjustment, longer breaths at twilight. One near-miss: “liquid gold” skirts cliché, but the context of cavern light rescues it. Closure line is clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The Seasonal Ear and echo-harvesting premise feel fresh, not steampunk default; the concept is grounded in geological memory rather than gadgetry. Transformation test passes: swap marble for wood or brass and the emotional arc collapses. Risk is taken in the quiet, lyric mode—no villain, no chase—yet stakes remain legible. Silas’s laughter bottled as light is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that recharges the opening image.</comment>
