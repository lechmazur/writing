<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the driftwood nostalgia is felt rather than stated. The final “simply listen” choice aligns with prior motives and has visible cost in the relinquishing of force. Motivation remains character-particular and complicates under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is clean: the heart-gear click, the melting frost, and the synchronized reflections form a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. All stakes and tactics are held together by the repeating image of rhythm found, not forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library’s spatial texture and the Hall of Mirrors actively constrain tactics and charge the final image; the ice “glow from within” at totality becomes the mirror that reweights Elara’s stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eclipse-clock pressure tightens once, culminating in the micro-choice to listen rather than hammer; the visible cost is the surrender of control and the audible “soft click” that travels through her bones.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: repair as communion vs. conquest, crystallized when the pulse beneath the stall is matched rather than conquered. The final image reframes prior motifs without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose carries a distinct lyrical precision; the perceptual signature filters every detail through the focalizer’s tactile bias. No head-hop; rhythm breathes in step with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High-density, zero padding; every clause adds texture without clutter. Tense clean, no loops, no mixed metaphors, no register drift. Images “frost ferns” and “seabed pulse” feel earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Transplants the mythic quest into a clockwork sky-library; the driftwood metaphor and gear-heart reprise transform familiar tropes. The rhythm-metaphor reweighting is unexpected yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
