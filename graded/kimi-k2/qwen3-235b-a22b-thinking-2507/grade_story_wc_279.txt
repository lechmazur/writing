<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (whimsy vs gravity) act simultaneously in the mandala beat. The socially perceptive trait is dramatized through micro-choices—reading Torin’s jaw, Lissa’s hands—and then weaponized in the silent interjection. The final renunciation (leaving the mandala to be reclaimed) carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “her soul humming” edges toward label-speak, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory detail and cadence shift (mist → sun, lilac unease → gentle resolve) reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the tile flake’s vibration—felt cost legible on page. Orientation anchored by ~80 words; no drift. One micro-turn (hush → action) tightens options cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, and tile flake function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the hush is physically amplified by the curved wall, the shard’s resonance shapes the mandala’s redesign. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (wet stone, lilac light). Final image recharges the grotto’s acoustics and color, meeting 9+ gate. One minor redundancy—“mist clung… damp shroud”—keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and tightened once when the hush demands action. Escalation is textural: lilac unease intensifies until Elara’s silent interjection forecloses despair. Cost is the mandala’s impermanence and the emotional toll of unlearning. No causal reversals, but under Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning as spiral, not line, born from unlearning. Subtext lives in gesture (trembling hands, relaxed shoulders) and object (tile flake as vessel). Final image reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo in dialogue; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: controlled rhythm, selective diction (“ochre, cobalt, burnt sienna”), perceptual signature of an artist who sees color before words. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; free indirect style is clean. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” in meta-comment—absent, so 9+ gate met.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Minor filter verb (“she felt”) in one beat prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk artist + whispering grotto + emergent hush yields non-obvious ritual of silent sand intervention. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped, confirming specificity. Risk in lyric mode pays off; no derivative premise detected.</comment>
