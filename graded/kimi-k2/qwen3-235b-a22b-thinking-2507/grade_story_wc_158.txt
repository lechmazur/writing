<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied (“his mind a relentless tidepool”), but the centuries-long span compresses micro-choices into summary; the final poem-blossom is earned yet the cost feels more stated than dramatized. Motivation (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) is consistent and drives every beat, but the lack of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the poem-blossom crystallizes the armistice with felt cost—“pain dissolve like sugar in tea.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern of nightly lullabies intensifies toward dawn hush. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shell’s acoustics and tidal breath constrain every lullaby; the postcard’s nebulae reappear in the final glow, charging the closing image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“briny wind snatched his murmurs”). Environment is indispensable to stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into beauty—tightens via nightly failure until the poem-blossom succeeds. Escalation is accretive: insomnia, wind, postcard pulse. Cost is visible in “centuries folded like origami” and the final surrender to sleep.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art as alchemy of sorrow. The postcard’s nebulae and the shell’s reef-shadow joy reweight each other without moralizing. Final image of “pain and beauty finally kiss” offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic, salt-cracked, and rhythmically tidal; patterned elision (“shyly unstoppable”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and distinct under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering risks overwriting in places (“cathedral of calcium grown colossal”) but never muddles closure. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—centuries-long insomnia inside a living shell—feels inevitable and fresh. Synthesis of cosmic postcard and conch-cathedral is non-obvious; risk-taking in lyric time-scale heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
