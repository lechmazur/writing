<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—mathematical certainty vs. human hope—are embodied in her subway micro-choices and final bedside gesture; the cost of re-evaluating her father is palpable. Interiority is specific, never generic. The only drag is a brief “theoretically rebellious” label that tells rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bedside exchange reweights the premise—probability describes, hope moves—with felt emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scrawls → mica lantern → father’s hand crystallizes meaning. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rainwashed library, humid subway, antiseptic ward are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s grief-sharpened perception. The mica lantern constrains her final choice—its fragility literalizes the stake—and recharges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to reconcile mathematical truth with human hope—tightens once on the train when Elara decides to read the scrawls as potential truths, then deepens at the bedside. Cost is visible: her prior certainty is foreclosed. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s choices; the final line (“sometimes the fallacy is what saves us”) reweights earlier material without moralizing. Subtext in the old woman’s “betting your heart” line carries more weight than any exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—probability metaphors, damp-green synesthesia—remains consistent. Compression (“clover melancholy light”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is spare but voice-differentiated; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. One minor loop—“lucid contradiction” repeated three times in close proximity—dulls the edge slightly, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of probability theory and subway graffiti as spiritual augury feels fresh and inevitable. Risky compression and lyric patterning heighten stakes without gimmickry. A hairline slip toward familiar “fragile hope” phrasing keeps it just under 8.0.</comment>
