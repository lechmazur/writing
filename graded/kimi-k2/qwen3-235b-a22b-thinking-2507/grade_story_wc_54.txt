<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara blends diligent engineer’s logic with stoic wonder: her tactile interaction with the sextant and the low hum of revived machinery feel personally specific and goal-driven. Interior contradiction—hope versus degradation—is embodied in dust-choked sparks and grease-streaked fingers. The ending earns her grim, gleeful endurance when she pockets the brass fragment as “a compass pointing to possibility.” Small risk: her curiosity edges toward convenient competence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot accelerates cleanly: intrusive setting → object spark → power surge → resurrection. The causal link is the sextant’s angles rerouting stray volts into coherent circuits, so “redirecting flows” becomes a micro-turn that crystallizes stakes. Motivated ellipsis (decades-dormant computer reborn) lands with a felt electric hum and living simulation on screen—decisive change complete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ozone-stale popcorn air and corroded control panels anchor place in the first chunk; carnival debris functions as collateral visual tension. The brass sextant fragment re-appears in the closure beat—warm against her palm—to close calibration loop. Micro-setting of a failed junction box constrains wiring choices and forbids easy fixes. Mid-cap: some balloons remain generically sad props without deeper specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is human renewal from ruins, signaled early and intensified when geothermal power surges back through terminal wiring. The sextant fragment tightens the beat—precise angle redirects redundant volts—fracturing a path that felt impossible moments ago. Cost is visible: sparks hiss, hands steady despite choking dust. No coincidence resolution; luck is a symptom of agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes as “hope is a flow I have learned to redirect.” Subtext lodges in tactile micro-choices rather than declarations: the weight of sextant brass, a dust-smudged simulation looping. Final image reweights prior abandonment into blueprint potential without sermonizing. Complexity: does not sanitize flaws or sanitize entropy’s price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Choice architecture is omnipresent interiority but grounded in sensual detail: “sparks hiss,” “brass cool against palm,” matching stoic wonder tone. Pronouns/adverb proximity stable; no unmotivated register drift. Rhythmic variegation supports acceleration and breath matching scene urgency under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is muscular and dense: “dust choking the air” compresses atmosphere and tension; strong nouns replace modifiers. Rhythm escalates during bypass scenes, then softens during quiet simulation; scaffolding minimal. Minor loops (“she,” “then she...”) overlooked because climax clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The repurposed-carnival-port-into-terraform-blueprint synthesis feels inevitable once the sextant geometry becomes a wiring calibrator, a risky but earned leap. Fresh inflection ties ephemeral joy decay to star-chart navigation. Closure image is quiet yet unmistakably decisive—system hum consuming silence—fully integrated risk without gimmick.</comment>
