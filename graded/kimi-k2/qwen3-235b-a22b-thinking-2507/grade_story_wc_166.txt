<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for oceanic memory vs. the need to escape censorship—are embodied in the micro-choice to inscribe her own skin. The moment she becomes “spontaneously anchored” crystallizes her cost: body locked, spirit fledged. Motive remains consistent, but the final renunciation (empty vessel left behind) is earned and felt. Interiority is specific, tactile, and avoids label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the verse’s completion reweights exile from loss to generative act. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each gap observed adds density until the constellation forms. Causality is lyric but legible: “observing gaps” → glyphs → fledge. Cost is visible in the abandoned body and consumed moonstone speck.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Garden’s cool soil, obsidian stone, and starlight are filtered through Elara’s kinesthetic memory, constraining her posture and anchoring the ritual. Micro-setting (inner forearm as canvas) becomes the final charged image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—only the gaps matter. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting forbidden longing into starlight—tightens when the nostalgia ban threatens bodily immobilization. One decisive deepening: the anchoring that forces the fledge. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-linear, but pressure is unmistakable. The price (corporeal abandonment) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: memory as rebellion, exile as homecoming. The final image—skin as map of liberated light—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence, gaps, and the moon’s absent pull. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with tidal cadences and precise sensory diction. POV remains tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance compresses under anchoring, mirroring physical stasis. Purposeful elision (“the gaps”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (spiral, crescent) cohere. Occasional elevated register (“epidermis”) is justified by ritual context. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long breaths before anchoring, staccato glyphs during inscription.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar tropes—exiled artist, forbidden memory—are transmuted through tide-dancer kinesthetics and cosmic inscription. The moonstone speck’s consumption as sacrifice feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reconfiguration. Specificity of glyphs and anchoring prevents generic overlay.</comment>
