<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s elegiac drive and embodied micro-choices (kneeling to the meteorite shard, pocketing the grain) anchor interiority; the final renunciation—carrying memory instead of intervening—earns its cost. One contradictory impulse (scientist vs mourner) is present but not fully dramatized in scene, keeping it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers texture and stakes until the chemical shutter’s click crystallizes the moment. Closure is a Charged Poise—the photograph fixed, the crater doomed—cost legible in “victory tasted of ash.” No orientation drift; causality of timer is tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Moonlit summit and crater bowl are rendered with selective sensory weight; the meteorite shard and sand grain act as micro-settings that constrain final gesture. Environment guides stance—camera angle, kneeling posture—charging the last image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the untouched crater—tightens via ticking chemical clock; one meaningful intensification at 05:17. Cost is felt in the ash-taste and the irreversible sunrise. Agency is endurance, not reversal, fitting situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of elegiac witness emerges through concrete particulars: hourglass grain, meteorite shard, chemical timer. Final image of pocketed grain reweights the premise—memory as resistance—without moralizing. Subtext in silence and light carries complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-anchored; perceptual signature filters every detail through Aris’s scientific-mournful lens. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences under moonlight, clipped beats near dawn. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“dawning hush” repeated twice without new charge—dulls edge slightly. Otherwise clean, vivid, and free of scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Apollo-era industrial sacrifice told through lone chemist’s timed elegy. Hourglass grain as memory capsule feels inevitable, not gimmick. Specificity of Barringer Crater and Hasselblad chemistry grounds the concept.</comment>
