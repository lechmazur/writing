<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory need to pry open guilty ghosts while insisting on “something pure” is embodied in gut-level detail—she kneels on subzero stone till her knees ache, her fingers still stinging with brine from the dive. Micro-decisions (choosing whose dream fragment to track, laying the globe into the niche with reverence that costs secrecy) externalize the clash between moral clarity and inherited shame. Her final whisper of thanks is earned; the choice is refusal-to-condemn coupled with acceptance of their shared fall, and the trembling in her exhale makes the cost palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal arc is lean: salvage request → dream-cameo decoding because it yields the structural-lie core → exposing that lie forces Elara to act. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the globe goes from “broken relic charged with guilt” to “lighthouse memory rescued from shame,” with Varga’s drowned image now bearing a salvaged, usable joy. The shift is visible on the page in the phrase “no longer looked broken—it looked like a promise,” the direct reweighting of prior motif.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Candle-lit ice shrine, the glacier itself, and the resinous amber snow globe each constrain tactics: candles stay lit against physics to mark sacred focus; the dome of ice amplifies every scraped syllable; the globe’s fused transparency determines how much truth she can physically bear to see. The shrine’s starlit refraction is harnessed in the final beat to render the globe’s amber glow into a visible covenant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The singular stake—can she retrieve an “unbroken memory” from a sunk ship fractured by human choice?—is sharpened one notch at a time: dream fragment reveals the lie → decoding raises cost of revelation → acceptance of collective responsibility tightens the remaining choices to “hold the memory publicly” or “bury it”; she endures the social shame of exposure but keeps the memory pure, the path narrowed and irrevocable.</comment>

<question>5</question><question>9</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emergent theme of salvageable grace from structural deceit arrives only through specific actions: the lighthouse bleeding water in the dream, the snapped piano-wire Morse, Varga’s final recollection of Elise’s laughter. No exposition moralizes; instead the concluding image reframes “salvage” from material recovery to ethical memory, with the glacier’s groan underscoring natural time as both eraser and keeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Cold-diving syntax—“fingers tracing the warped glass,” “tears froze on Elara’s cheeks”—compresses senses beneath weight of task. Free-indirect dips into coastal dreamers (blue umbrella, piano wire) preserve single-focalizer clarity while the lyric pattern (compressed clauses, noun-heavy fragments) teaches itself in sentence one and holds to the final line “windows of connection holding fast.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety from terse frost-fragments to flowing subordinate clauses adjusts rhythmic intake with scene pressure. Every descriptor pays rent (“cloudy amber tear,” “steel coffin three hundred fathoms down”) and no clause restates another. One faint purple—“beneath the crushing dark”—is tolerated because it compresses the horror that forces the captain’s pivot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Wreck-diver ghost-whisperers exist in folklore, but embedding psychopomp labour inside strangers’ dreams as memory forensics, then folding that labour into ethical salvage, is a precise, non-obvious synthesis. The procedural novelty is grounded in tactility—wax stuck to globe glass, frostbite on fingertips—preventing gimmickry. The inversion of sea-death stories—saving purity not souls—arrives with inevitability that retroactively illuminates every prior image.</comment>
