<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief, intellectual curiosity, and hard-earned reverence are enacted through tactile micro-choices—fingering grain, pacing the bench, stepping back three deliberate paces. Her contradictory impulses (rescue vs respect) coexist through climax, resolving in Earned Stasis that feels both painful and necessary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (“bowed, honoring the space”) lands with undeniable emotional cost; the Causal lens (distance dictates reality stability) holds without fumble. Final image re-weights every logbook notation and corn-row spacing discussed earlier—no teleporting data.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drifting prism shards and corn-maze wind corridors anchor space and limit movement; the wooden bench becomes micro-setting that literally encodes a navigation correction (WX-9). Sensory filter is urgent, scene-integrated, never catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crossing the sacred threshold without destroying reality—tightens once Elara realizes “yield, not force” must reverse her approach. Escalation is one clean pivot under a live clock (terrace dissolving) and the cost is the father she still cannot physically reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme that “distance is what makes contact holy” manifests entirely via action and setting, never sloganned. The fractal hush and WX-9 quietus reverberate through image rather than speech; ambiguity left intact yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric compression—“featherly determined,” “fractured hush,” “grain revealed” sentences pulse Elara’s heightened sensorium under duress. POV holds, no leakage; patterned elision (e.g., ellipsis of threshold mechanics) is taught early and paid off in final restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences sculpt momentum: rhythmic inhales and exhales mirror the terraces’ lurches, yet density stays high—each figurative phrase carries nav-code cargo. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors until a hairline cliché “eye of a storm” that just avoids penalty by its function as literal storm geometry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Sacred topology mapped through meteorology and carpentry is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk of ornate fragmentation is fully embodied by prismatic shards and turns into coherent constraint; the corn-maze navigator metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
