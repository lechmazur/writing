<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s interiority is embodied and precise—her calm is a tactical necessity, not a label. The borrowed heartbeat mechanic gives her motive a visceral cost, and her micro-choices (kneeling, humming, sustaining the note) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—vanishing before the third bell—earns its poise through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors revert, the mirages dissolve, but the “quiet certainty that possibilities… could never be entirely unseen” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each lullaby adds density until the hush crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism parapet and rain-slick mirrors are not backdrop but medium; their refractive logic enables the coded lullabies and constrains the painter’s grace. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—droplets “refracting the dying light” and the “last amber light” charging the final image. Micro-setting (wet stone, silvered glass) directly shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show warm possibilities—tightens once when the central mirror resists and the painter must deepen stillness to sync collective yearning. The cost is felt in the widower’s tears and the painter’s vanishing; escalation is one decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between ephemeral beauty and irrevocable knowledge; no moral is stated. The final image—mirrors returning to mere reflection while the mind cannot—reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: the painter’s bare feet, the widower’s sharp intake of breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to vibration. Perceptual signature is painterly—light, moisture, refraction—filtered through a calm that never slips into detachment. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in the painter’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise (“mirages dissolved like sugar in warm tea”). Syntax breathes with scene needs—long, liquid lines for calm, clipped fragments under pressure. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of children’s lullabies with optical sorcery feels inevitable and fresh; the borrowed heartbeat as price for warmth is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of rain-slick prisms and coded minor thirds anchors universals.</comment>
