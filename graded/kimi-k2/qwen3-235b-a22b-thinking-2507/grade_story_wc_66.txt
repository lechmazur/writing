<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—precision vs. desperation—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of silence is earned by her prior risk-taking and embodied in the glowing dust. The “copyist” trait is not label but muscle memory that alters tactics. Cost is felt when she folds the fresh parchment, knowing dawn patrols still threaten.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers density—radio static, lyric fragments, dust rehearsal—until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dust’s blue pulse reconfigures the world’s silence with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; every lyric line is seeded and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember alcove, mist, stool, radio—each object constrains choice: the dial’s glow guides tuning, the ember’s heat limits visibility, the mist presses secrecy. Micro-setting (dust motes) becomes the final charged image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach dust to speak”—tightens through escalating risk: static clears, lyrics sharpen, patrols loom. One decisive intensification: the final cloak turns silence into testimony, foreclosing her anonymity. Cost is the fresh patrol risk she now shoulders.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: erased narratives vs. granular memory. Final image of glowing dust reweights the premise—testimony survives erasure—without moralizing. Subtext in “dust remembers the shape of a quill” carries the entire thematic load.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, tuned to a copyist’s ear: “spectral broadcasts,” “thistled calm.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm modulates with tension—short bursts during static, longer cadences as dust learns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful: “mist pressing against stone walls” sets pressure. No mixed metaphors. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—dust as witness—feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk: lyrical compression could have muddled causality, yet closure remains legible. Specificity of orchestral dust gives universality without cliché.</comment>
