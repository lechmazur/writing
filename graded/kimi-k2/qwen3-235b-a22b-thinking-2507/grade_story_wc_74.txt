<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s insomniac painter identity infuses interiority and motive, but turns depend more on theme than character-specific contradictions. His methodical hope stays consistent rather than evolving under pressure, limiting earned change. Emotional embodiment is vivid, yet choices feel pre-ordained by concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The inferred Causal lens drives the story: nighttime ritual → painted word → stranger’s memory. Closure lands in the bus-stop beat with visible cost (hope awakened in commuter). Minor flaw: no tightening escalation beyond the one pivotal moment.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rooftop greenhouse functions as breathing refuge and smog mirror. Micro-setting pressure—plants drooping, moonlight through grime—guides Elias’s tactic of lunar-ink mimicry. Setting constraints could sharper (oxygen, visibility) but remain coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear: keep language alive vs city amnesia. The middle beat (painting word) narrows options to public intervention. Cost is largely emotional; physical risk to artist or plant is absent, softening escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme asserts itself through action: forgotten tongues → shared kindness proved. No overt moralizing; final commuter smile reframes prior canvases as seeds. Sufficient resonance emerges from particulars without tidy dictums.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct painterly POV filters smog as "wet wool" and moonlight as "polished bone." Dialogue absent; voice holds steady in internal monologue and sensory filter. Free-indirect texture, when Elias “sees the curves and dots of Nahuatl,” matches his vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; only a few stacked metaphors ("saffron quiet," "amnesiac haze") nudge purple. Density serves atmosphere without obscuring causality. No line-level loops; clean syntax under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Concept of lunar-ink street art is fresh; execution uses familiar urban-grit tropes. Risk is mainly thematic, not narrative—no tangible danger beyond fatigue. Feels original within the constraint of quiet activism rather than guerrilla rebellion.</comment>
