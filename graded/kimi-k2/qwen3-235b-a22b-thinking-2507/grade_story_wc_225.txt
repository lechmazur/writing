<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s shame, misread gambit, and dawning self-forgiveness are all embodied in tactile knot-work and thread-plucking; interior contradictions visible in her hesitation-stillness pair with decisive micro-choice to stop fidget. Cost is felt—“the villagers’ silent judgment” and the “hard-won clarity” she now carries away.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “she carried not exile’s burden but the hard-won clarity,” with felt cost in the long decades lost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pattern intensifies as she winnows threads → tapestry reweighs blame → labyrinth reveals sabotage, each layer tightening the emotional aperture to the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Time-frozen village, leaden sky, dust-shrouded tapestry, and the micro-setting of Elara’s own palm-sized labyrinth work together, constraining her physical movement and focusing every sense on thread, knot, and memory. The chill cobblestones and distant thunder feel in-the-body, anchoring spatial and temporal stasis without static catalogue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can I forgive myself for a war I did not fully cause”—escalates as each decoded thread strips a layer of self-blame. A single, visible tightening occurs when the azure-ochre sequence proves tampering; live option of pure guilt foreclosed, price still visceral in the silent frozen villagers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Themes of agency vs. manipulated history, vanity vs. responsibility, and forgiveness as integration emerge entirely through concrete action (thread sorting, labyrinth re-reading) without a single thematic line of dialogue. Ending’s quiet whisper to “her younger self” offers non-literal resonance that reweights the prior crown judgment without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Lyrid, slightly formal diction fits the estranged tutor’s intellectual precision; metaphor density mirrors the maze-game—“winnow, pluck, map”—while remaining legible. No POV leakage; every abstraction is pinned to tactile handling of threads. Rhythmic rise and fall echoes the thunder’s lull → crack → distant roll.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density; vivid tactile verbs (“plucking,” “gleamed dully”) propel every sentence. Some minor scaffold (“froze mid-stride, forever caught in their last breath”) costs –0.3 but does not dull the closing image of “steady drum of rain on frozen earth.”</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Post-war chronomancy curse + chess gambit + exiled tutor + pocket labyrinth = surprising yet inevitable synthesis. Transformation test survives intact: if names or genre skin changed, the specific error-tapestry interplay and sabotage-proof would vanish. Fresh inflection in using tapestry border as forensic evidence.</comment>
