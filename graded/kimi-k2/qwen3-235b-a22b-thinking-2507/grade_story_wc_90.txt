<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal to fight the grasping shadows, yet the interior contradiction—her need to act violently to liberate—remains abstract rather than dramatized in a single micro-choice. The final embrace of her own death-wish shadow is moving but compressed into summary, softening the felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dimension opens, souls depart, ship quiets—an Earned Stasis that costs Elara her remaining life-force. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each ritual beat layers density until the final cadence shift releases the ghosts. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The recycled ship’s cold metal and spectral dust constrain every motion; the shrine room’s photographs act as micro-setting that literally powers the ritual. Final image of emptied yet peaceful corridors reweights the stakes. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped souls—tightens when shadows solidify into grasping hands, forcing Elara to risk her last reserves. The single deepening (embracing her own darkness) narrows options and visibly costs her buoyant life-force. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate integration of darkness emerges through ritual action rather than statement. Final image of “emptier yet whole” ship offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in the tear’s blue pulse and dried tears’ shimmer carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue, so bullets skipped. Occasional elevated diction (“gravitationally lighter”) is taught early and consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara’s tactile awareness of recycled metal and spectral residue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“recycled spaceship… recycled bulkheads… recycled bones”—is pattern-taught and pays off in closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final cadence breathes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Buddhist shadow-work meets post-human ghost-liberation ritual in a dying starship. The premise commits fully; no retreat into generic tropes. Transformation test fails—story is inseparable from its setting and object logic. Risky buoyancy mechanic is grounded and paid off.</comment>
