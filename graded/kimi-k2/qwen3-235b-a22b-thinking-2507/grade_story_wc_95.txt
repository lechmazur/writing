<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Silas’s mechanical-arm-as-constant-reminder and his micro-choices under duel pressure (using each lunge to realign for the sundial reading) make motivation kinetic; the interior contradiction between quoting Heraclitus and parrying steel is dramatized, not declared. The foil-to-card pivot shows a hierarchy of values—treaty over pride—yet the cost (arm jolt, risk of death) is present but not deeply felt, capping short of 9.</comment>

<comment>Causal lens holds: because Vorlag attacks, therefore Silas must fight; because he fights, he can finish the angular reading. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the anthem’s notes reweight the water-rights stalemate with undeniable social cost. One scaffold loop (“the brook continued its quiet murmur...”) and a late “dignified chaos” tag keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glass dome, fractured light, half-painted dial, and brook reflection are filtered through Silas’s tactical gaze; the sundial’s gnomon and shifting shadow literally constrain where he must stand to survive and decode. Spatial choreography across the duel is clean; only the foil’s sudden appearance (no prior cue) slightly thins credibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—secret treaty terms—tightens when the duel replaces diplomacy; each parry narrows Silas’s spatial options until only the seventh-hole alignment remains. Escalation is causal, visible, and paid for with physical risk; the anthem revelation forecloses continued combat without further blood. Cost is legible but not viscerally sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through images: unfinished time, needle’s eye, anthem as shared song—questions becoming destinations. No moralizing; the brook’s “questions finally arriving home” reweights prior water imagery with conceptual cost. Subtext in duel dialogue (“You seek clarity, Thorne?”) carries negotiation within violence. One near-explicit line—“the answer is not here, but in the brook’s song”—barely stays on the safe side of statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-limited adheres to Silas’s perceptual bias—brass joints, solar angles, scent of glass polish—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer observation, compresses under lunge-parry beats. Distinct diction: “diplomatically fierce,” “lethal grace,” foil-vs-arm contrast. Only minor cadence repetition (“each lunge, each retreat”) tempers full 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate; information density high—light fractures, joints whir, card holes equal notes. One paraphrase loop (brook murmur) and a stock “silver streak” for the blade are minor artifacts; they do not touch the closure beat. Rhythm modulates with duel tempo, propelling rather than stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing Copenhagen needle-code, half-painted sundial, and live fencing to unlock a national anthem is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the conceit feels inevitable once revealed. Risk taken—treaty encoded in solar music—pays off without gimmickry. Tropes (duel, cyborg arm) are retooled through geometric diplomacy, not decoration.</comment>
