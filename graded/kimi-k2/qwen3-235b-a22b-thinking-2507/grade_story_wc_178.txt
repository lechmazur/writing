<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—his frugality as vow, the tile as sacred relic—but the final beat (“tears pricked his eyes”) edges toward summary rather than embodied cost, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tile’s shift from 15 to 21 reweights the premise, and the cost—“new regime would burn his papyri”—is legible on the page. Causal lens holds from alignment ritual to cosmic reply.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cracked alabaster floor, candle, and lapis tile function as micro-setting that constrains Kael’s ritual; the palace’s “bones between empires” charges the final image of harmony beyond regimes, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sealing a covenant before erasure—tightens when the tile’s glow confirms reciprocity; the cost of irreversible loss (papyri) is felt, though the escalation is more accumulative than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: devotion as listening, not spectacle. The final image—starlight alone on the square—offers a resonant, non-moral answer to the question of sacred knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, archaic yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Kael’s lens-grinding patience. No head-hopping; compression in “palace groaned” line teaches the pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor scaffold (“its numbers… its numbers”) and one mixed metaphor (“liquid mercury”) keep it from 9+. Rhythm modulates with ritual pacing, no loops in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian magic square as radio receiver tuned by poverty. The inversion—kings blind, pauper enlightened—feels inevitable yet non-obvious, with risk-taking that sharpens stakes.</comment>
