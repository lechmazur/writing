<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara is vivid—age, plant-telepathy, and insurgent stance fused in every beat; her contradictory impulses (tradition vs evolution) act simultaneously in-scene. Cost on page when she renounces passive waiting to unseal the embryo, sealing her outlaw status.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain: kite-tail script → decoding → unseal → hybrid shoot; closure reconfigures the land’s future. Drive lens holds; every turn flows from Elara’s choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hot-spring micro-setting is tactile (scalding water, sulfur, obsidian glow) and actively constrains access to the embryo; plant-telepathy turns the reeds into narrative agents.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: salvation vs erasure of post-eruption land. Escalation narrows as unsealing the embryo becomes the only path; cost is exile from elder society and irreversible hybrid rebirth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges via lived stakes—Elara’s “insurgent” act proves tradition survives only by changing. Final image of sapphire-rooted shoot is a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prophecy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice crystallized: dry, insurgent humor (“they’d ignored the mountain’s warnings”), plant-telepathy filtered through elder wisdom. Syntax sharpens under heat; steam is “spectral hands,” reeds “hum in chorus”.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is clean: no loops, strong verbs (“bristled,” “shimmered”), short, muscular clauses that accelerate toward unseal. Final image reused amber-obsidian metaphor echoes opening—tight loop that recharges.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: volcanic-vs-plant telepathy and amber destiny intertwined; no stock elder/priest template—prophecy becomes a live seed. Risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
