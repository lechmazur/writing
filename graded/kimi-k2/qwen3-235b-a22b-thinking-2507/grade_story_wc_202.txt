<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the lens fragment anchors contradictory impulses (honor vs. practical risk) that culminate in the decisive turn of the brass key. The grandmother’s remembered voice is the only reflective block and it tilts the present choice. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation stays character-bound and intensifies to the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger opens with a “sigh like retreating tide,” crystallizing the cost of remembrance. Causal chain—glyphs → logs → transmissions → key of light—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. The final image reweights the premise: the lighthouse’s grammar now belongs to the city.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The swaying market walkway and the brass case function as micro-settings that constrain stance and tool use. Sensory selection (fractured glass, bottled starlight) is filtered through Elara’s translator priorities. The lens fragment itself serves as setting-object hybrid, charging the final image. No spatial drift; weather and height affect balance and visibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the drowned keepers’ names—is signaled early and tightened by each painting clue. Agency is exercised in each micro-choice (angle the lens, trace glyphs); the final turn forecloses secrecy with visible cost (the case’s sigh). Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of translation: overlooked histories gain voice through light and glass. No moralizing; the final image of “echo of waves and the weight of gratitude” reweights prior material without statement. Subtext operates in the woman’s swirling eye-logs and vanishing-ink transmissions. Complexity lingers: honoring the past imposes future responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“liquid shadow,” “drowned stars”—mirrors Elara’s perceptual signature. POV remains tight single-camera; no head-hop. Compression (“time existed as an eternal instant”) is taught early and paid off in closure. Dialogue minimal but voice-apt: Kael’s rasp advances stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“grammar for the lost”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during glyph discovery, longer breaths at closure. Clean mechanics; no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse trope is transformed through the translator premise and the lens-as-grammar device. Specificity of bottled starlight and powdered memories grounds the fantastical. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in lyric compression heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
