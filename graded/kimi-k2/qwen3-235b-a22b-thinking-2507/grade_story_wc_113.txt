<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with the ghost and the code is clear and embodied—he wades, lifts, traces, tilts. Interiority stays tactile (“damp pages clinging to his chest like a second heartbeat”). Yet the moment of decision—choosing to carry the program out—arrives almost gift-wrapped; the cost of that choice is asserted rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the water-stained program reweights the past and Elias’s future. Causal linkage holds: flood → discovery → map → burden. The final image (“ready to disrupt the past’s lies”) crystallizes new stakes with felt cost. One minor slack: the tunnel sketch appears late, so the shift feels slightly exogenous rather than fully seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The drowned pit is not mere backdrop; its cold, rising water forces every micro-choice—where to step, how to tilt the paper before it dissolves. The lantern’s flicker and liquid reflections charge the final image. Spatial choreography is exact; no floating props. Meets the 9+ gate: the environment constrains tactics and reweights the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode Voss’s message to clear his name—is signaled early and tightened once: the program’s disintegration clock. Pressure escalates through Elias’s agency (tilting water to reveal the tunnel). Cost is visible—the program may crumble, the building is condemned—but the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: truth resurrected from ruin, art persisting in damaged matter. Subtext runs through gesture—water as both destroyer and revealer. The ending’s “resolution” note avoids moralizing. Yet the theme’s complexity is slightly blunted because the tunnel sketch arrives as a sudden gift rather than a culmination of pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical but grounded in Elias’s musician’s perception (“unstruck chords,” “phantom violins”). Syntax modulates with stress—longer sentences for wonder, clipped fragments when urgency peaks. No POV drift. The occasional elevated phrase (“liquid mercury”) fits the heightened moment. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image, action, and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent (water as ink, ruin as language). One near-miss: “second heartbeat” edges toward cliché but is rescued by context. No artifacts near closure; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ghost-code-through-water-damage conceit feels fresh, transforming a familiar haunted-building trope into an epistemological puzzle. Specificity of the 1898 Traviata program and the hidden tunnel grounds the invention. Risk taken: using literal water as writing instrument pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
