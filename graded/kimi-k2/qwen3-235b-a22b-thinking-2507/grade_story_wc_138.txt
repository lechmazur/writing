<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aeon’s contradictory impulses—boredom vs. desperate curiosity—are dramatized in every beat: tracing the shard, weighing its hunger, choosing release. His embodied reactions (“crushing boredom had lifted”) mark earned change. The final renunciation carries visible cost: loss of the only tether to meaning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (storm → fragment resonance → vortex collapse) tightens options until the decisive throw. Closure lands on the page with felt cost—amulet gone, purpose rekindled. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is not backdrop; its fractures and liquid starlight chamber actively constrain movement and perception. The healing crystals in the final image reconfigure the stake, proving environment as crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates via the mutiny’s pressure. The tightening occurs when Aeon realizes the fragment engineered the collapse; his choice to sacrifice the shard forecloses reliance on it, paying the cost of uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: farewell as permeable membrane rather than terminus. The final image of rain on stone offers non-literal, resonant reweighting without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—has he truly crossed or only seen the path—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, calibrated to an immortal’s weary perception (“eternal boredom had settled into his bones like sediment”). Compression and elision (“salt and silence”) are taught early and paid off. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and artifact-free. Metaphors serve clarity (“walls flickered, revealing glimpses…”) without purple overload. Rhythm modulates with tension; no loops or register drift. Closure image is unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic-scale farewell explored through intimate, dimensional mutiny. The shard as both key and parasite transforms a familiar “artifact quest” into ontological inquiry. Risky structure—collapsing reality as emotional crucible—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
