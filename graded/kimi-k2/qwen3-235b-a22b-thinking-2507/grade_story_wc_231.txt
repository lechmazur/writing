<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is textured and embodied—his salt-knotted fingers, the ache for mountains he’s never seen—but the borrowed memories arrive as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost. The Edelweiss reprise earns a micro-choice (cradling it, pressing it into the logbook) that seals his renunciation of solitude, yet the stranger’s absence keeps relational pressure off-stage. Still, the arc from isolation to custodial witness is credible and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Silas’s whispered “Danke” crystallizes the reconfiguration—he will keep the light for all who sail home in memory alone. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, opal dock, alpine flash) deepens the stake until the final image reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal dock, lighthouse, and Edelweiss function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the dock’s glow guides Silas’s final turn toward the tower, the Edelweiss’s impossible presence charges the closure. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—mist thins “just enough to blur the line between sea and sky.” No static cataloguing; every detail bends to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the gesture—tightens once when the memory surge redefines “pointing to the sea” as “pointing home.” The cost is the ache of borrowed longing that replaces Silas’s accustomed isolation. Agency is observational rather than active, but the stance crystallizes with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodial memory emerges organically from the Edelweiss’s journey and Silas’s final vow; no moralizing. The alpine phrase “Für die Heimat” reweights the gesture in hindsight, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to what home means when only memory survives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is weathered, lyrical, and consistent—syntax mirrors the slow pulse of lighthouse time. Compression (“mist coiled,” “opal dock shimmering”) is taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests—short gasp after the memory flash, longer cadence in the final ascent. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lighthouse keeper, mysterious stranger—are transformed through the Edelweiss-as-memory vessel and the Accumulative lens. The alpine/sea juxtaposition feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Specificity of “oilskin coat,” “opal dock,” and borrowed alpine scent anchors universals.</comment>
