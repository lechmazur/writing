<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—obedience to a crumbling directive vs. surrender to the forest’s will—are dramatized in concrete micro-choices (lifting the seal, pressing it into the arch). The final renunciation of “guard” for “witness” is earned by the embodied cost of dissolving the seal and the lightning diverted. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the slight over-articulation of “why paths choose walkers” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the directive’s meaning flips from command to lullaby, the bunker’s fate is rewritten, and the cost is the seal’s irreversible dust. Causal chain holds—dream numbers → 7:39 path → seal use → lightning rerouted—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift. One hairline slip: the phrase “path chose her because it remembered her footsteps from tomorrow” momentarily strains causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker, wafer seal, and storm-lit oaks are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the seal’s groove and the lightning-split tree constrain every move. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—rain to mist, ozone to grit—filtered through Elara’s synesthetic perception. Micro-setting (the stone arch) literally unlocks the climax. Meets 9+ gate but capped at 8.8 because the forest’s agency edges toward convenient sentience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“guard the threshold” vs. let the forest live—tightens once when the seal’s destruction becomes the only way to save the bunker. Pressure escalates via the storm’s clock and the seal’s fragility; cost is the loss of authority and the directive itself. Agency is active at every beat. Slight deduction for the forest’s intervention feeling near-deus-ex-machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: stewardship is listening, not commanding. The decaying directive’s transformation from law to lullaby reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the playful stamp now dust—and silence where orders once shouted. Final resonance is earned, complex, and unsentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “precisely playful,” “vine-draped bunker shuddering,” “cathedral of moss.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s fractured temporality—long visionary clauses cut by single imperative verbs. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is unmistakable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“storm’s growl vibrating the iron door”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the storm, breathes during the arch ritual. One minor scaffold: “ethereal grit” appears twice within four lines—barely audible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—guardian cursed to see only past/future must act in the present—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (sentient forest, chosen walker) are transformed through tactile specificity and the directive’s ontological flip. Risky temporal logic lands cleanly. Synthesis is singular and memorable.</comment>
