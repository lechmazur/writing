<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the alchemist’s refusal of false comfort is dramatized through micro-choices (tightening grip, turning away from the bottle). Motivation to rebuild civilization is clear and escalates to the final mental labor. The Earned Stasis—choosing memory over illusion—carries visible cost in the strain of working memory. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, capping at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lanterns rekindle from internal will, not magic, reweighting the bottle from loss to potential. Causal lens holds—each beat flows from the last wish’s aftermath to the alchemist’s refusal and mental construction. Cost is legible in the “strain under the weight” of memory. One minor ellipsis (how lanterns ignite) is allowed under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Salt-bleached pier, leaning wooden bones, and frayed lantern hooks anchor place and mood. The amber bottle and single re-lit lantern function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no seam or stopper teaches the bottle’s sealed nature. Environment subtly guides the shift from despair to constructive vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to succumb to illusion or build anew—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through the alchemist’s mental labor; each imagined detail tightens the cost of forgetting. The final rekindling of lanterns crystallizes the choice with felt effort. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience through confronting sorrow emerges organically from the alchemist’s refusal and mental construction. Subtext operates in the bottle’s silence and the lanterns’ return. Final image offers non-literal answer: light born of will, not wish. No moralizing; complexity remains in the unbroken but empty bottle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with salt-bleached, fossilized tears, neural pathways of seagrass. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for memory strain, short pulses for lantern flickers. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“green strands interlacing like neural pathways.” No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated and rare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of post-wish ghost town rebuilt through working memory is fresh and non-obvious. Bottle without seam and lanterns as memory seeds transform familiar tropes. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk in lyric compression pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
