<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interiority feels sharp: Elara’s simultaneous refusal to lie and desperate equation-making collide in body-level tension (“wrist tremored as ink hung from nib”). Her micro-choice—offering her father’s network knowledge as asset—rings true to the “honest child” contradiction, but because we don’t see Silas physically, the backstory reflection tilts summary toward 20 % BRR ceiling, capping higher resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Reynolds’s reluctant “I’ll present this” reweights asylum from charity to market-exchange, Elara’s Charged Poise over the pot signals acceptance of ongoing cost. Causal lens holds—each “because” step narrows Silas’s options until the only available path is Elara’s equation. The 8.6 honors the moment yet stays short of 9+ because the deportation threat is external, not yet embodied by Silas on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prep room’s cold instruments and rain-lashed windows physically close the space, funneling choice: stainless forceps become moral levers, formaldehyde a scent of moral corrosion. The cobalt pot re-appears twice—once as relic, once as diplomatic emblem—charging the final image under the micro-setting allowance. A hairline flick: one spatial coordinate (“rows of embalmed corpses”) repeats, slightly blurring orientation but recovered quickly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Silas from deportation—clarified in line 4 and escalated by single, irreversible bargain. Escalation comes via knowledge price: public exposure means Silas’s remaining allies dry up, a cost visible on page when Reynolds warns “must be airtight.” Agency remains Elara’s throughout, no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—“value for value without deceit”—unfolds through economic imagery rather than lecture: the ink’s valuation, immigration quotas, traded truth. The ending’s silent glance at the pot reframes prior motif from family baggage to moral accounting scale. It avoids tidy moral by refusing to name Silas repentant; ambiguity costs Elara, keeping the 8 band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose shows perceptual signature: Elara notices “viscosity defying gravity,” death room sounds “hummed with sterile electricity,” register never slips into reportage. One minor filter-stack blip—“ink liquefies rigid thinking, a property she’d tested... she’d spent nights...”—three successive filter verbs dampen directness but contained within two beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alters nicely with pressure: short declarative bursts when official arrives ("Knock echoed.") cut against earlier long coils of equation. Few ornamental metaphors and no redundant loops, though “clock tick synced to her pulse” edges toward cliché without new inflection.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The immigration-asylum-as-market-transaction angle feels freshly welded to mortuary micro-setting; corpse-room as negotiation chamber isn’t stock. Emotional specificity of an “honest child” repurposing con-man tools rescues it from trope terrain; only small bump is the near-parabolic “fair trade” metaphor already familiar from econ-lit.</comment>
