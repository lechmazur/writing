<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaela’s hunger to understand echoes is viscerally rooted in her vanished brother; every sensory intake vibrates with that motive. Her contradictory wish to sing yet stay unseen surfaces in “Let them,” a micro-choice that crystallizes risk. Yet the Council remains a disembodied menace and Renn a cipher, limiting relationship crucible; internal stakes outweigh external contact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Causal lens is legible and held: because Kaela’s brother echoed and vanished, therefore she investigates; because contact warns of blood-truth, therefore she resolves to sing first-verse fragments. Closure is Charged Poise—Kaela lifts the shell to her lips, cost framed by Renn’s prophetic warning the Council “will come.” No orientation lapses or off-stage trickery. One clean tightening beat is sufficient for short scope.</comment>

<comment>The serpentine nexus is no backdrop—the canyon walls literally carry sound and record erased voices, shaping tactic: singing here risks exposure because sound behaves as monitored data transfer. Micro-setting is woven in motion: cool sandstone under bare feet, shell catching moonlight, echo-tracking vibrations. Spatial anchors hold across the single shadowy scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is early and stark: to discover the truth of selective echoing without joining the silent graveyard. Progressive disclosure escalates this by degrees—first verse at Dawn Cleft, twin shell sought from Elara—each step narrows options and heightens peril; Renn’s warning that “they’ll come” renders the cost legible and tightening.</comment>

<comment>The question “why do the echoes choose some and not others?” threads every beat until the answer ‘it’s blood’ reconfigures motive to defiance. No explanatory sermonizing; theme emerges from her decision to risk singing. Final line pledges: “I’ll sing… and the canyon would answer,” thematically re-echoing vanished voices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Voice is textured and character-bound: perceptive sensory filter, intimate canyon lexicon (“reed-blown melancholy”), restrained yet lyrical cadence. Kaela’s internal register never slips into exposition; compression feels intentional, rhythm tuned to secrecy. Dialogue between Kaela and Renn maintains individual idiom despite brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Line-level execution is dense, musical, virtually free of loops. Example: “her brother’s voice had bounced off the canyon walls like liquid silver before they took him” does four jobs—memory, sensory flash, menace, inciting wound—in a single clause. Few if any filler sentences: every phrase seeds pressure or stakes.</comment>

<comment>The piece re-orients the trope of chosen voices by grounding it in speculative genetics (“Council suppresses those born with the resonance gene”) rather than whimsical fate. Micro-detail—split seashell key, echo-song as data path—synthesizes tech-lyric with primal myth until the fusion feels specific to this canyon only.</comment>
