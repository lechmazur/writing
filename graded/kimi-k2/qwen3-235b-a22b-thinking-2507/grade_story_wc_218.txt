<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is embodied and consistent—“brazen calm” threads through every beat—but the final renunciation (“They will remember this. Not me, but the pact.”) is slightly under-costed; the physical toll is gestured rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s new architecture reconfigures meaning while Aris’s mortality charges the image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each copper loop and diary entry thickens pattern until the solstice tableau crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Living stone pillars and copper-wired oaks are rendered with tactile specificity; the orchard itself constrains every tactical choice and supplies the final resonant image. Micro-setting (diary, wire, sparrow) integrates seamlessly, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interspecies respect before death—tightens through each beat; the solstice completion forecloses further intervention. Cost is visible in raw hands and tightening lungs, though the escalation is more accumulative than sharply reversed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly from copper guiding oak and stone yielding root; the final image of sparrow on wire reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext of legacy versus ego is handled with disciplined restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris’s perceptual signature—“brazen calm,” sap-stained diary, mineral scent of stone. Rhythm modulates with labor and weather; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“petrified giants cradling gnarled oaks”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, action, or interior charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The living-architecture premise is fresh, executed through specific botanical craft rather than abstract magic. Risky compression of months into lyric shards pays off in the solstice tableau; transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
