<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is legible and consistent; the interiority is concrete, and the final renunciation of “ghost-chasing” for archival dismantling is earned. Yet the emotional register stays coolly analytical—no contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, so the turn feels more intellectual than visceral. Competence is high, but genuine struggle is largely off-stage, muting cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: salvage → decipher → expose fraud → resolve to dismantle. Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: she pockets the sundial and forecloses the treasure-hunt path, accepting the quieter labor of truth-telling. Cost is conceptual but legible—“dismantling brick by brick” carries future toll. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Canal, reeds, and barges are sketched with selective sensory economy; the pocket sundial serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Twilight/morning light shift is tracked without spatial drift. Details filter through Elara’s surveyor-trained eye, integrating tool, body, and mud. Environment does not tighten options further, so 9-band gate not cleared.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing the lie—surfaces early and tightens once when the inscription reframes the myth as land fraud. Agency is present: she decides to archive-hunt, forfeiting the glamour of legend-chasing. Pressure is cerebral, not visceral; no tangible price is dramatized on page, keeping escalation just shy of high-band punch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—how capital weaponizes wonder—emerges through the sundial’s journey from surveyor’s tool to mystic talisman and back. No moralizing; the final image of “truth salvaged” reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext in the radio silence motif links media complicity to myth endurance. Complexity acknowledged, but emotional resonance stays muted.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is archaeologist-close, noticing tarnish, gnomon bend, silt. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates at the reveal. No dialogue to test, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction—no slippage into generic epic diction. Elision is minimal and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; figurative language is spare and purposeful. No loops or scaffold detected. Occasional elevated phrasing (“serene upheaval”) borders on oxymoronic flourish but stays within POV tolerance. Clause rhythm modulates with the beat of discovery; final sentence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fraud-through-folklore is familiar terrain, yet the canal-as-survey-evidence angle and radio-silence motif freshen the frame. Specific Latin inscription and bent gnomon supply tactile novelty. Risk is moderate—concept-driven rather than twist-driven—but execution is confident. Does not reach high-band surprise, feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
