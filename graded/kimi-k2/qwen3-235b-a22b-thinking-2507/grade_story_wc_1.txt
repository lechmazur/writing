<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—trembling fingers, molten flux memory—yet the “purpose in the pauses” refrain edges toward label-speak. Her adaptive trait is dramatized when frost-reading shifts her from artist to tracker, but the ledger’s emotional weight is asserted more than felt. The final stance crystallizes with cost: her art weaponized, her safety foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the vial’s discovery reweights the ledger from evidence to compass, with the cost that her own craft abets smugglers. Causal chain holds—ledger → frost → vial—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Canyon, frost, and glass shard function as micro-setting that constrains tactics: frost patterns guide tracking, the shard becomes signal. Sensory detail is selective—velvet sky, needle-like ice—and filtered through Elara’s artist eye. The shard’s reappearance charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival and justice—tightens when frost patterns force a single path forward. Escalation is one deepening: from hunted to hunter via adaptive reading of the canyon. Cost is visible—her lantern glass turned against her—under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of repurposing pain into purpose emerges through concrete particulars—molten glass, scorched paper, frost script—without moralizing. The final image of the vial reframes earlier motifs; ambiguity lingers about complicity. Subtext is carried by gesture and object, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “luminous glass artistry momentarily forgotten” marries craft to crisis. Compression is purposeful—“drifting resonance” taught early and reprised at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elara’s perceptual range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional lyrical surplus (“velvet sky,” “black gold”) flirts with overwriting but serves tone. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “artist vs smugglers” frame is refreshed by glass-as-signal and frost-as-map. Specificity of craft and canyon micro-ecology make the synthesis feel inevitable. One fresh inflection: the shard’s repurposing charges the ending.</comment>
