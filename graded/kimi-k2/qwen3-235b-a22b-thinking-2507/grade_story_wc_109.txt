<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with the booklet and her need to map silence are clear, embodied, and escalate to the final choice; the interior contradiction between clinging to light and embracing darkness is dramatized in the act of mapping absence. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the map’s completion crystallizes a Charged Poise where silence becomes navigable ground. Causal lens holds—each lull of storm is a beat that tightens toward the final star’s extinction. Cost is legible in the candle’s guttering and the absolute dark swallowing the fort.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storm-tossed fort and candlelit cell are vividly selective; the flaking booklet and pooling wax act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara’s salt-stained fingers and listening stance, grounding the metaphysical task.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the endless night before the last star dies—is signaled early and tightened by each measured silence. The final star’s wink-out is an earned, visible cost that forecloses retreat; agency remains with Elara’s mapping act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence not as void but as traversable terrain. The reweighting of silence from absence to ground is earned through concrete mapping beats, avoiding moralizing. Final image resonates without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tidal, salt-stained—and remains coherent under pressure. Compression and elision (“ambered hush,” “shape within the void”) are taught early and paid off in closure. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with storm lulls and surges, culminating in the crystalline final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartography of silence as apotropaic ritual. Transforms familiar “last star” trope into navigable quietus. Risky lyric mode commits fully and succeeds.</comment>
