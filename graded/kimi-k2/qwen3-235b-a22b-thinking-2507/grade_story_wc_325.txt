<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arden’s claustrophobia and mission to honor Vale are embodied in every squeeze and gasp; the final choice to risk drowning for the capsule crystallizes her arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific and sensory, not diagnostic. One slip: “tears stung… mixing with seawater” edges toward cliché, slightly blunting embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Arden escapes but accepts lifelong custodianship of Vale’s echo, cost felt in the tide’s roar behind her. Causal chain—codex → hatch → capsule → sprint—tightens under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors set by line 3. One minor convenience: tide arrives early without prior cue, but it complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drowned facility is tactile, constraining every move—water at knees, then waist, then throat—until the open sea cave offers literal and psychic release. Micro-setting of the gold-flecked capsule becomes the pivot object. Sensory hierarchy follows Arden’s panic: sound narrows to heartbeat, vision to headlamp cone. No wasted detail; every drip counts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Vale’s legacy before tide—tightens once, irreversibly, when water surges. Agency is continuous: each micro-choice (plunge hand, lift codex, sprint) escalates risk. Cost is visceral: scraped shoulders, burning lungs, lifelong burden of memory. No false reversals; coincidence (early tide) raises stakes, doesn’t solve them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-preservation emerges through the cables’ “ghostly echo” and Arden’s refusal to let Vale vanish. Subtext in the gold flecks: beauty that only reveals under exact pressure. Final image—Arden breathing with the tide—reweights the premise without moralizing. One soft line: “keeper of echoes” flirts with label-speak but is earned by prior embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is salt-cold, precise, and panic-tinged: “the crashing hush… vibrated in her bones.” Syntax tightens with claustrophobia—short clauses when walls close, longer breaths in the cavern. No POV leakage; perception stays strictly Arden’s. Distinct texture sustained to the last line.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image does double duty (“rusting consoles jutted from the water like tombstones”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“cathedral of ruin” followed by “tombstones”—but the pattern is taught early and holds. Rhythm accelerates flawlessly during escape.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of spelunking thriller with deep-sea data archaeology feels inevitable and fresh. Gold-flecked EM-sensitive ink transforms a standard MacGuffin into a believable scientific marvel. Risky compression of entire expedition into one tidal window pays off; no safety hedging. Specificity of polymer phase transitions as data storage is non-obvious and fully integrated.</comment>
