<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s lifelong “weathered innocence” and her tactile need to prove words alive are specific and embodied. But because no second character is on-stage the pressure must come from her interior choices; the scene risks becoming pure attunement rather than choice. Her final act—cradling the cooled crystal and refusing a treatise—qualifies as Earned Stasis and is rooted in prior discoveries, but the emotional cost registers more as residue than as a sharp change. She reaches 7.8: vivid but slightly under-pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is clearly Accumulative/Textural: each echoing fragment enlarges the web of language and raises the psychic cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is threaded by 80 words, avoiding debt. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope born of a fragile, weight-bearing silence—delivered on the last line and paid for by her renunciation of documentation. Minor lens tightening is complete with no causal errors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting of dust-laden dawn light, motes as “scattered letters,” and the fallen chandelier shard all stay specific and selective. The library breathes like an organism without tourism lists. Its silence constricts movement (Elara catches the rolling crystal before it shatters), charging the ending. Only the bird’s chime feels slightly convenient; still, the environment tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: confirm or disprove that language still lives. Progressive frictions accumulate—the vowel shift of “verdant,” the breaking of “solitude”—so the pressure is felt rather than rationally solved. One decisive tightening is the moment the crystal rolls; acceleration is present, though the pay-price (renouncing publication) is more oblique than visceral. The score lands just below 8+ range because consequence is legible yet soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme surfaces through action: words as decay-or-growth, silence as incubation. No direct statement about “meaning” appears; the final answer is the motes rising like letters. Sub-textual irony is present—her legacy will be wordless proof of unbounded words. A touch too tidy, lacking counter-complications, so it stops short of the 8.5+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is writerly and lyrical yet consistent—“the library held its breath,” “as dust on forgotten tomes”—fitting a scholar’s perceptual habit. Rhythmic variation mirrors her widening attention, angling from long clauses to the crisp “Then, a whisper.” No head-hop, no register drift. Distinct texture, propulsion, and internal coherence under pressure support 9.2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is almost loop-free; only “the library held its breath / hush enveloped everything” risks tight echo. Sensory specificity cuts clutter (grimy windows, cold facets). Strong refusal of filter verbs keeps immediacy. No mixed metaphors; closing image cleanly recharges earlier motifs. One minor redundancy keeps it from 9.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Uses the familiar “last printed book” trope yet flips it into vocalized language crystals—a fresh but inevitable synthesis. Minimal character, single tool, single setting, risk taken without gimmickry. The final re-weighting of hope feels specific to this crystal, this dawn, this woman. Distinguished and memorable at 9.4.</comment>
