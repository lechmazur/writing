<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grim necessity and offhanded exactitude are embodied in micro-choices (counting steps, adjusting the nut a fraction). Interior contradiction—resentment versus oath—drives every beat. The final retrieval of the nut crystallizes her endurance with felt cost: the curse still chains her. A touch more bodily specificity under stress would nudge this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: oath → travelers appear → blueprint path → frost clock → successful guidance → curse persists. Closure is Earned Stasis: she walks home still bound, cost legible in the frost on the nut. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One causal leap—why the nut alone triggers the path—keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard’s bitter fruit, cliffside labyrinth, and copper-winged birds are selective, sensory, and pressure-driven. The nut’s cool smoothness and frost rime act as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Mechanical birds patrol with spatial coherence; thorns and stones guide footfall. One more non-visual cue (sound of gears?) would perfect it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide travelers before frost or soul tightens—tightens once when frost crystals form as the travelers reach safety. Agency is clear: Elara’s exact exhalations steer the path. Cost is the frost on the nut and her unbroken chains. A sharper forfeiture (lost tool, stamina) would push 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant caretaking and inherited duty emerges through action, not statement. The graceless beauty of the orchard mirrors Elara’s graceless precision. Final image—frosted nut, still-bound soul—reweights the premise without moralizing. Slightly overt “wondered if guiding others was the key” line softens the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “gnarled,” “whirred and clicked like broken clocks.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she saw,” “she watched”) could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences advance scene or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“clawing at the twilight”) serve mood without clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“graceless beauty”) fits the lyrical tilt. One mixed image—“chains” felt but never seen—flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of orchard curse, mechanical birds, and blueprint-guided “whispering the way” feels fresh yet inevitable. The acorn keystone and frost deadline synthesize familiar fairy-tale notes into a singular vision. Risky non-contact pathmaking pays off. Minor echoes of clockwork-fae tropes keep it from 8.5.</comment>
