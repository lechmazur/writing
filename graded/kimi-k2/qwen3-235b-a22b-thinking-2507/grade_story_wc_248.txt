<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the “volcanic tenderness” line crystallizes her contradictory impulses. Motivation is consistent—guardian vs. arsonist—and the final renunciation (sealing the archive) is earned by prior causality. Minor slip: “analytically intuitive” is label-speak that never manifests in a concrete micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map she draws on the wall reconfigures the promise’s meaning and forecloses revelation. Causal chain from library fire → archive → new mural is tight; no teleporting props. Orientation is immediate; no debt. One hairline slip: the blank scroll’s conceptual cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jungle humidity, volcanic rock, and sulfur scent anchor the scene; the archive’s stone and ash constrain her choice to veil the mural. Micro-setting (charcoal, tapestry fragment) functions as charged objects. Selective sensory detail supports urgency without cataloging. One minor drift: “molten gold” sunset edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise—tightens when she realizes the blank scroll demands secrecy, not disclosure. One meaningful deepening: the fire is reframed from destruction to preservation. Cost is visible (eternal silence, social scorn) but not viscerally staged; still legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship through erasure emerges organically; no moralizing. The blank scroll and ash veil reweight the premise—knowledge survives by being hidden. Final image (charcoal map under ash) offers non-literal resonance. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “volcanic tenderness” and “dormant energy” reflect Elara’s mindset. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for discovery, clipped ones for sealing. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Occasional elevated diction (“civil war had shattered that vow”) slightly drifts from character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—volcanic rock mirrors her contained fire. One mixed moment: “heart hammered with volcanic tenderness” blends cardiac and geological without muddle. Clean grammar and punctuation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist as guardian, vandalism as map, blank scroll as promise. Tropes (lost archive, chosen one) are transformed through Elara’s specific moral calculus. Risky choice—ending in silence—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
