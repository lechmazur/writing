<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (obedience vs. hope) act simultaneously in the button-mapping beat. The final choice—turning the gold hourglass and preparing to descend—earns its cost through prior causality and visible exhaustion. Mentor’s echo (“Buttons remember…”) anchors motivation without slipping into label-speak. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents higher-band crucible dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy’s meaning flips from doom to compass, with the canyon-jar’s laughter as undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each button placement is a because/therefore linkage that narrows options until the map emerges. Orientation is anchored by ~90 words; no disorientation. Persistent constraint—the elders’ stone-wall reading—shapes tactics to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, resinous light, and cliff shadows constrain movement and mood; the canyon echo jar literally charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“dust from a jar containing a canyon echo”). Spatial choreography is clean across the button circles and hourglass turns. Environment, tool, and body together shape the decisive choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn prophecy into possibility—signals early and tightens through each button click. One meaningful deepening: the brass buttons shift from meaningless to coordinate system, foreclosing the elders’ doom reading. Cost is visible in Elara’s tears and the warehouse’s held breath. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven; coincidence complicates (jar trembles) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom as seed, not sentence. Subtext lives in gesture—the palm on the amber wall—and in the canyon echo’s shift from ancient bones to children’s laughter. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and POV-consistent; perceptual signature is selective (“sunlight bled through high, resinous windows”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax, longer breaths in reflection. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Experimental compression (“unearthed silence”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught (“time moved only at her command”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final third is artifact-free, allowing 9-band entry. Strong verbs and concrete nouns throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—prophecy encoded in lost buttons—feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes (doomed prophecy, wise elder) are transformed through tactile specificity and inverted stakes. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, object-as-language) heightens coherence without gimmickry. Synthesis is specific to this voice and setting.</comment>
