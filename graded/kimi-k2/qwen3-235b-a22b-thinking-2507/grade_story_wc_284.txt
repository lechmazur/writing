<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—burned spy’s caution vs. father’s need to mend—are embodied in the tremor of his hands and the deliberate scrape of symbols in snow. The pillbox’s weight and the daughter’s initials anchor interior stakes without exposition. Final nod from Mara crystallizes earned absolution; cost is the years of exile now irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (scraping snow, radio crackle, sunrise timing) tightens options until transmission succeeds and entry is risked. Closure is a decisive change—bridge rebuilt—paid for by irrevocable exposure. Cost legible in “I vouchsafe the codes are clean,” staking his last currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zephyr Bluff’s silver hush and tilted light are not backdrop but active constraint: snow depth must be exact or reflection fails. Mist, pines, and pre-dawn chill narrow perception to tactile immediacy. Final gleam of coded snow recharges the setting as conduit for redemption.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transmit testimony to redeem fractured trust—escalates as sunrise clock and doubled guard compress options. One tightening: Mara’s refusal forces Elias to vouchsafe himself, trading anonymity for certainty. Cost is the bullet he now openly risks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending the broken emerges through concrete acts: cipher in snow, pillbox engraved with lost promise, radio bridge. No moralizing; resonance arises from final image of gleaming codes streaming upward—testimony and fatherhood both restored at once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, weathered, ex-spy precise: “silver hush,” “tilted earth,” “unused courage waits.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses during scraping, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hop; Mara’s voice arrives via radio, filtered through Elias’s tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language (“mist clinging like a second skin”) is sparse, purposeful, never muddles clarity. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar spy-redemption arc is refreshed through snow-cipher transmission and pillbox as both cipher key and broken promise. Specificity of method and emotional cost elevate trope. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure rather than shoot-out; coherence maintained.</comment>
