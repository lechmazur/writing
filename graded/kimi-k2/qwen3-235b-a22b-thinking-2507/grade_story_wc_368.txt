<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the donor-heart beat anchors her obsession and the final renunciation feels earned. The shift from “chasing stories” to “being the calm” is credible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, wing, sun trail, journal) thickens pattern until the morpho wing’s final placement crystallizes the new stance. Closure is a Charged Poise with conceptual cost—she forfeits active pursuit for receptive stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Floating tea house, valley mist, and morpho wing are rendered with selective, purposeful detail; the wing constrains the final choice by becoming the daily talisman. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to magnetize stories—tightens once when the journal reframes the quest from pursuit to listening. The cost is quiet (abandoning active search) but legible; escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: magnetism lies in stillness, not charisma. The morpho wing’s iridescence becomes the non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image of “holding the light gently” resonates without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (dye master’s chromatic attention) colors every observation. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (iridescent caution, sun trails). No loops or scaffold; minor filter verbs are voice-motivated. Final paragraph maintains clarity and cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses organ-transplant intimacy with artisan metaphysics in a fresh synthesis. The morpho-wing-as-lens device and “quietly explosive” heart feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring closure.</comment>
