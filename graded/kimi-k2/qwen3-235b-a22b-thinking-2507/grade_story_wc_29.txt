<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is vivid—his finger smudging yesterday’s coffee stain on the chart is a perfect, embodied tic—but the “cautiously hopeful” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. The contradiction between terrestrial powerlessness and cosmic agency is present, yet the cost of his sabotage (the station’s imminent shutdown) is external rather than personally felt. Still, the micro-choice to reroute seismic power is specific and stakes his last scrap of credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: because the university is collapsing, Aris repurposes grounding rods; therefore he disrupts the false signal, but the surge trips breakers and seals his fate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he steps into the crowd with the clean chart as a banner—cost paid by the station’s death sentence. One transition (inside to quad) is clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The radio station’s aging infrastructure—coffee-stained charts, humming grounding rods—functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactic. The campus protests outside bleed in as audible pressure, anchoring time and social stakes. The subsonic pulse traveling through bedrock is a tactile extension of setting that directly enables the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the integrity of cosmic truth against both human and alien sabotage—is signaled early and tightened when Aris chooses sabotage-by-infrasound. The escalation is one decisive intensification: false pattern collapses, breakers trip, administrators gain excuse. Cost is visible on the final line: “the department might still bleed.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of mirrored deception—human power plays and cosmic mimicry—emerges organically through the parallel sabotages. The final image of the rolled chart as “banner of cautious hope” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the protest noise versus cosmic static invites reflection on who gets to define reality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly academic, yet charged with sensory grit—“smudging yesterday’s coffee stain,” “ancient whisper of the cosmos.” Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. The oscilloscope’s red pulses and infrasound hum are filtered through Aris’s technician’s ear, maintaining perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence advances either technical procedure or emotional stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal grit,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly strains register but stays within Aris’s cerebral POV. No loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s cadence slows to crystallize the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of campus budget crisis and alien signal tampering feels fresh; neither thread would function without the other. Repurposing lightning rods as subsonic jammers is a specific, non-obvious tactic. The story commits fully to its premise and lands a quiet, earned defiance rather than spectacle.</comment>
