<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—protocol vs. listening—play out in real time. The final renunciation of the switch is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (solitude, professional risk). One slip: “humble pride” edges toward label-speak, blunting the beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she refuses the siren, pulls the bell once, and the valley hears calm. Causal chain holds—data anomalies → doubt → bell rope test → silence. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the decisive refusal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The windblown sanctuary, bell rope, and microclimate tracker all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the rope’s stillness mirrors the sky’s hush. One minor drift: “cathedral” feels slightly grand for the sparse setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—false alarm vs. true vigilance—tightens once when data contradicts models. Agency is decision-to-refuse; cost is professional censure and personal isolation. Pressure escalates cleanly under Causal lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening over noise emerges organically from action and data, never sermonized. Final bell note reweights the premise: silence as signal. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the valley’s unheard judgment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature favors tactile meteorological detail. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm, clipped fragments at zero hour. No head-hop; POV remains locked and modest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. One paraphrase loop (“the solstice hush felt less like peace and more like suspension”) could tighten. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-siren protocol reframed as monastic listening. Bell rope as quiet alarm is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of microclimate data grounds the lyric frame; risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
