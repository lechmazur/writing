<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tuning-fork memory and tactile listening are specific and embodied. The mother-daughter pair exert immediate pressure, forcing Elias to risk his professional boundaries. His final choice to keep the vial carries visible relational cost and crystallizes his arc from “fixer” to “reminder.” Only a trace of therapy-speak (“ordinary magic”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s first hum and the ridge’s answering song reweight the premise—healing is remembering, not repairing. Causality holds: the eclipse is foreshadowed, the vial is seeded early, and the ridge’s response is earned by Elias’s childhood memory. Cost is legible in Lila’s relinquishing the keepsake and Elias’s acceptance of lifelong custodianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is not backdrop; its humming stones and iron-tasting air actively constrain the ritual and supply the final harmony. The vial and tuning fork act as micro-settings that charge the climax. Sensory selection is urgent—eclipse half-light, glowing hair—filtered through Elias’s trained ear. Only the off-stage studio scenes feel slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias midwife Mira’s voice without breaking therapeutic or personal limits? Pressure tightens once: the eclipse forces a public, irreversible intervention. Agency is Elias’s decision to bring them to the ridge and surrender the vial; the cost is Lila’s trust and his own custodial burden. Coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: voice as remembered wonder, healing as collaborative listening. The baby curl and ridge song accumulate meaning without overt statement. Final image—the vial beside the tuning fork—reweights the premise silently. A single line of thematic echo (“ordinary magic”) is mild enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is musical—everything is rhythm, breath, harmony. Syntax modulates with tension: longer lyrical lines yield to clipped beats at the eclipse. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but voice-distinct (Lila’s “rough as dried sage”). Minor drift into therapeutic register is contained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data. Metaphors are fresh—“roots drinking rain”—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Only one soft filter-verb cluster (“he decided”) in the final third, not enough to dull the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of music therapy, eclipse ritual, and singing land feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes (magical healing, eclipse climax) are transformed through Elias’s professional lens and the ridge’s geological memory. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
