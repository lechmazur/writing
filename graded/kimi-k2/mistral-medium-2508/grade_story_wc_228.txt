<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief and promise-keeping are embodied in the warm shell and ochre-stained hands; the final leap is earned by the shell’s reprise and the cave’s pulse. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The cost—burning the past and surrendering to the pool—lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s jump reweights “temporary eternity” from abstract idea to lived stasis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image crystallizes choice and cost. No causality breaks; the mirror’s crack seeds the rule early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cave’s bioluminescent dome and still pool constrain every choice; the shell’s sunset colors charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, filtered through Elias’s painter’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean; the cave breathes with him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keeping the promise to his mother—tightens when the pool reveals her living image, forcing the leap. One decisive intensification: burning the paintings forecloses return. Cost is visible in the ochre-stained hands and the villagers’ murmurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief-as-circular-time emerges from the shell, the cave, and the leap; no moralizing. The final image of endless sunsets inside the shell offers a non-literal answer to loss. Subtext in the villagers’ misreading of suicide deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, salted: “brushstrokes ghosting,” “salt and old promises.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long cadences in memory, clipped beats at the cliff edge. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is precise—“labyrinthine, hungry,” “time curled in on itself”—and never muddles. Final line lands clean: “the cave exhaled, and the world outside carried on.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The grief-cave-time synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; the mirror-crack rule and painted-shell motif transform familiar loss into singular vision. Risk in the quiet leap pays off with crystallized meaning. No derivative echoes.</comment>
