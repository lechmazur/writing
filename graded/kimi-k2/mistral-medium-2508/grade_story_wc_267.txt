<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory fear-of-and-desire-for-sound anchors every beat; bolt choice shows micro-trade-off of safety vs truth. Numb arm nerve-revival is embodied cost foreshadowing acceptance of pain as “real sound.” Final renunciation is earned by prior causality, but silent-choir identity functions more as backstory label than active trait under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts through pattern of intensifying hush and tactile cues. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias accepts auditory return (“for the first time…answered”) with felt cost. Orientation and causality remain sound; minor elision on pianist’s return route waived under accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cobalt-stone chill, snow-slough weight and humming hallway air are evocative but used mostly as mood filter; only the bolt as micro-setting constrains a choice. Fortress fails constraint test for final image, capping top band. Vividness high, selective use effective, yet one step short of charging ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fortress’s enforced silence—clarifies early; one meaningful deepens when Elias hands bolt to pianist, acknowledging silence’s true price. Agency present; off-stage scream is coincidental complicator not solver. Escalation tightens through sensory deprivation rather than reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as chosen ignorance emerges organically via image and event; subtext in stitched lips works well. Final non-declarative image reweights premise: “the fortress answered” without sermon. Avoided thematic exposition; only faint drift toward abstraction in final paragraph keeps score under 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct hush-laden rhythmic signature—“snow like notes on a broken scale”—sustained POV. Compression (“cobalt… the color of a bruise”) taught early and paid off at closure. Free indirect tone stable; no head-hops. Elevated diction borders ornate but stays within bellhop’s perceptual lens.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Highly musical sentence-level rhythm; clarity intact, minimal loops. One mixed metaphor cluster around “seraphically mundane halos” teeters into purple; minor density charge applied. Overall precision carries scene without drag.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic horror and mundane service labor; silence-as-facade premise reframed via fortress hospitality. Piano-rebuild taboo inversion earns surprise without gimmick. Specificity rescues trope from generic haunted-locale template.</question>
