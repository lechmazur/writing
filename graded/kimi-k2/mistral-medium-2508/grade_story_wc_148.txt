<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt, filial duty, and hunger to rewrite history—are embodied in the lattice’s burn against his ribs and the whispered names. His micro-choice to pluck his father’s name from the unfolding wood crystallizes the arc and carries visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic; the final grin with “copperlight in his teeth” shows earned endurance rather than tidy growth. The only slip is a faint safety-hedge in the final smile that softens the moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the lattice’s final blue flicker reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s theft of the name re-threads the tower’s echo-system, cost felt in the reef’s held breath. Orientation is taught early by the rusted-needle lighthouse and the door’s worn scuffs. One causal hiccup: the noon bodies are announced before we see Elias’s agency create them, a minor ellipsis that doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison, reef, and lattice act as micro-settings that constrain every move: tide hiss through bars, copperlight beam painting choices, lattice veins guiding fingers. Spatial choreography is flawless—door scuffs, gearworks, cracked glass spiral track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors salt, rust, and wood warmth filtered through Elias’s bias. The final image of the reef “holding its breath” charges the setting with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to rewrite the beginning via the dead’s names—tightens when the lattice unfolds and he must choose one. The blue flicker of the beam marks the decisive intensification: he pays with his father’s name and the prisoners’ futures. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The cost is visible: the lattice seals, the reef listens, and Elias walks away branded by the warm name in his sleeve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the image of echoes being “rewoven”: stories as prisons or liberation. Subtext lives in silence—the hush between note and scream—and in the lattice’s refusal to speak again. The final blue flicker offers a non-literal answer: truth is mutable but never free. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in Elias’s “nothing” that is finally true yet still unbelievable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic—salt-crusted, rust-rasped, copper-lit. Syntax coils like the spiral crack: “the tide hissed through the iron bars.” Perceptual signature is Elias’s: he notices warmth in wood, knots that shouldn’t hold, the color shift from copper to held-breath blue. No head-hopping; even the whispers remain external, filtered through lattice vibration. Compression is purposeful—“the boy who cried wolf’s son” teaches the lineage in four words.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “a scream frozen mid-breath,” “copperlight in his teeth.” No loops, no scaffold; every line advances image or pressure. Metaphors stay coherent—lighthouse as rusted needle, reef as bared teeth. One near-purple phrase—“throat of the sea”—earns its place by anchoring the lighthouse’s predatory stance. Rhythm accelerates on descent, matching urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-prison, confessional lattice, and inherited lie feels inevitable yet fresh. The fairy-tale echo (“boy who cried wolf”) is inverted: the son now tells a truth no one will believe. Risk is high—metaphysical theft of the dead’s names—but grounded in tactile detail. No derivative scaffolding; the premise could not survive name-swaps. Final reconfiguration of blue light versus copper stakes a new myth.</comment>
