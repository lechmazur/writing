<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her chant, the kerosene knot, the way she “filters the darkness”—but the final beat (“the world was heavier…so was she”) is asserted rather than embodied; we feel the cost conceptually, not physically. Still, her contradictory impulse to both flee and ignite is dramatized in the rocket launch and the trembling earth, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the starless sky becomes starred because Liora’s fire gives “the dark something to push against.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rocket adds density until the mosaic’s command “Defy the weight” reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the spent rag and the villagers’ changed gaze.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fortress blooms, the vines pulse like a “slow, silent heartbeat,” and the mosaic tiles only speak when struck by flame—setting actively constrains and enables the climax. Micro-setting (the tower’s peak, the rag’s flare) is tactile and stakes-bearing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened by each rocket; the final star-rebirth is not coincidence but the earned rebuttal. One clear escalation beat: the ground itself exhales after the first launch, narrowing options to continue or quit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of ignition: light as memory, defiance as weight accepted. The final image of Liora walking away “heavier” offers a non-literal answer—hope is mass you choose to carry. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the spent rag and newborn stars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “dust that smelled of crushed lavender and old gunpowder,” “hush thick enough to chew.” Compression and elision are taught early (“Sparks rise, though the sky forgets”) and paid off in the final chant. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data without clutter. Occasional poetic reach (“vines of liquid fire”) skirts overwriting but stays legible under pressure. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene heat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fireworks designer who re-ignites a starless sky feels inevitable yet fresh; the kerosene rag as memory-keeper transforms a familiar trope. Risk in the lyric mode pays off—the final “heavier” reweights the entire premise without gimmickry.</comment>
