<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his disbelief in miracles yet belief in roots anchors every micro-choice. The contradiction between foreign callouses and childhood memory drives the planting of the seed. The final laugh is earned, carrying visible cost: the cracked sundial and the villagers’ cautious hope now rest on his shoulders. Only the “warmly curious” mural figures feel externally imposed rather than internally compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sapling splitting stone reweights the premise—faith is not dug up but rebuilt. Causal chain holds: warm stone → seed → cracked base → orchard stirring. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift in the final paragraph crystallize cost without a causal reversal. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is not backdrop; its breathing roots and overripe-fig air constrain every move and charge the final image. The sundial base itself becomes micro-setting that literally fractures under new life. Sensory selection narrows to damp earth, sweet rot, and lantern-shadow, all filtered through Elias’s bodily labor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tomb mouth to mural wall to sundial hollow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accretive: each unearthed bone hums louder, roots guide deeper, seed swells. One decisive tightening: the sapling splits stone, foreclosing the option to leave the valley unchanged. Cost is felt in the cracked relic and the villagers’ now-unavoidable expectation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of interrupted journeys emerges from bones mid-sentence and roots mid-breath, never sermonized. The final image—orchard branches “heavy with the weight of what was to come”—reweights all prior burials as paused stories now resuming. Subtext lives in tactile verbs: brushing, pressing, whispering. No thematic echo in dialogue; resonance is imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is tactile and olfactory—“calloused hands,” “overripe figs.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under labor. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds. Final sentence’s quiet assertion (“Some things…”) matches the cautious enchantment tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “roots that pulsed faintly, as if breathing” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“leaves unfurling like hands in prayer”—and never mixed. Rhythm modulates with discovery; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The diaspora-returnee tending saints’ bones via a sundial-seed grafts orchard, catacomb, and memory into a singular vision. Familiar tropes—miraculous regrowth, buried relic—are transformed by tactile specificity and the refusal to name the event miracle. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
