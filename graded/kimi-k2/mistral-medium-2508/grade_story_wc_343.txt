<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing charts, brushing grit, charcoal sketch) and drives every beat; the final grin and steady hand show earned change. Captain Veyra’s single on-page beat supplies credible status pressure that shifts to respect. Interior contradiction (rule-breaking vs wonder) stays active in scene. Cost is visible: Liora accepts future discipline for the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Decisive Change: the loop snaps, engines roar, horizon opens—felt cost is the crew’s prior weeks of drift and Liora’s jeopardized standing. Causal chain holds: phrasebook clue → hopscotch pattern → luminance alignment → escape. Orientation anchored by brass portholes and deck within 120 words. Lens is Causal; no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Airship brass, starling shadows, and glowing hopscotch squares are vivid, selective, and constrain choices—light pattern literally pilots the ship. Micro-setting (dusty board) functions as navigation tool. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but justified by map-maker POV. No static cataloguing; every detail feeds the pattern recognition engine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape the temporal loop—signalled in paragraph four. Escalation is one tightening: recognition of pattern → collective jump → release. Agency is Liora’s pattern-mapping; cost is weeks of drift and implied reprimand. Coincidence (starlings) complicates but does not resolve. Pressure coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “pause to see patterns others miss” emerges through concrete particulars—phrasebook, hopscotch, starlings—without moralizing. Final image of horizon “golden” and sky that “remembers” offers resonant reconfiguration. Subtext in Veyra’s shoulder clap: respect wrestled from irritation. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in future discipline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: map-maker’s noticing of grids, light pools, cloud-ink. Syntax tightens under pressure—“The ship lurched. Liora steadied...” Dialogue sparse but natural; Veyra’s diction (“plotting our descent”) fits captaincy. No head-hopping; POV stable. Rhythm modulates with engine coughs and starling hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“clouds curled like ink”) are precise and POV-apt. Sentence variety supports momentum. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous”) justified by lyrical closure. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar airship trope transformed via map-apprentice POV and hopscotch-as-nav-device conceit. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in merging starling murmuration with temporal loop pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of brass portholes, dog-eared phrasebook, and chalked grid anchors freshness.</comment>
