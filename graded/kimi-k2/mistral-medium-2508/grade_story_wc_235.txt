<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—chronicler vs. burner—are embodied in the scroll and the match; the final renunciation is earned and costly. Interiority is concrete (“feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs”), but the younger self’s dialogue drifts toward label-speak (“delusion of control”), capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll’s burning reweights the premise, the grave is empty, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. The pattern of recursive return is taught early and paid off with visible cost in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cabin’s timber bones, the slant of dying light, and the wind that “howled like a thing that knew him” all constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the empty grave is a micro-setting that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep chronicling or to burn the record—tightens once when the younger self appears and again when the match is struck. The cost is legible: the scream of the scroll and the empty grave.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive burning of memory; the final image of soaring after erasure offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in the scroll’s glyphs bleeding into “fall” and “drown.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and compressed (“time was a wound, and they were just the scabs picking at it”). POV remains stable; the younger self’s speech is slightly less textured, but the effect reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold (“too many winters, too many versions”) is outweighed by rhythmic control and high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The recursive chronicler who burns his own archive is a fresh synthesis; the risk of nonlinear recursion heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the universal: “Keeper of Forgotten Hours” on a pine-needled grave.</comment>
