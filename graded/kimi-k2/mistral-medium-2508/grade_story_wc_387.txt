<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elder Kael’s quiet authority and Liora’s tentative curiosity are embodied in micro-gestures (whisk stirring, mimicked whistle), but Kael’s interior contradiction is muted; the “hidden effort” motive is stated more than dramatized. The final hand-off of the whisk to Liora crystallizes a credible endurance/renunciation with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pattern of whistle–net–tea is reconfigured when Liora takes the whisk, foreclosing her former blindness with visible cost (her pulse, the nets “breathing”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the weave until the final image reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parapet’s wet stone, moss-crushed mint, and moon-silvered harbor are filtered through Kael’s craft-centric gaze; the bamboo whisk and breathing nets act as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Environment and tool jointly charge the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeing hidden effort—is signaled early; the single tightening occurs when Liora’s whistle makes the minnows surface, forcing her recognition. Cost is legible in her sudden bodily awareness and Kael’s relinquishing of the whisk, though the pressure curve is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unseen labor emerges organically from the tactile handling of nets and whisk; the final image of nets “breathing” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing. Subtext in gesture and silence deepens the meditation on invisible frames that hold the world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from hushed observation to the soft crescendo of joined whistling. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound. Dialogue is spare but subtext-rich (“The fish see”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “scales flashing like scattered coins,” “steam curling into shapes that almost made sense.” Zero loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“scintillatingly somber”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of net-mending philosophy with moon-path mysticism feels fresh and inevitable; the bamboo whisk as both tool and baton of legacy is a non-obvious yet organic pivot. Risk in quiet lyricism pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
