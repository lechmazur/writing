<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—precision vs. silence—are dramatized through trembling hands and the choice to withhold the forecast; the final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character-specific, though the “fault-tolerant” label is more asserted than embodied. Micro-choice to place the smudged illustration center-table crystallizes her hierarchy of values. Emotional progression layers hypocrisy and self-deception without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s step into the storm forecloses the path of warning, with the cost legible in the vanishing footprints. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station’s groaning ribs and frost-laced window constrain Liora’s movements and frame her silence; the smudged illustration becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through POV bias. Weather and altitude affect choice and stamina. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to speak the true storm timing—is signaled early. One decisive tightening: Liora chooses silence, letting the storm come. Cost is visible in the vanishing footprints and dissolved weight in her ribs. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of living in margins and the price of withheld truth emerges organically from Liora’s choices and the smudged aconite. Final image—ravens against aurora—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and charcoal wings. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature shows in “taste of copper” and “weight of what she didn’t say.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor elevated diction (“aurora’s sorrowful glow”) is voice-motivated and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope with meteorological precision and ethical silence. Specificity of aconite illustration and mountain station anchors universals. Risk in lyrical withholding pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
