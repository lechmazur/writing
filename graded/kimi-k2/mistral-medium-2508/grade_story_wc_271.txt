<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—rage toward tourists vs. need for stillness—are embodied in the palm-sting and photograph release; the final micro-choice to prune the living wood earns the Earned Stasis with visible cost. Interiority is specific, not therapeutic, though the “quiet talent” label is slightly ornamental. Motivation holds steady under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sensory and memory layers tightens until the photograph’s release and leaf-tuck reconfigure meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—options narrowed, cost felt in the empty pocket and scented leaf. No orientation drift; causality of grief-to-renewal is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Arboretum, cliff, cypress, and salt wind are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain the final gesture—leaf plucked, photograph caught. Micro-setting (cypress bark, fig trees) functions as both refuge and mirror. Sensory hierarchy supports emotional narrowing without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Lena can convert frozen grief into forward motion—tightens once when she releases the photograph and accepts the leaf. Agency is renunciation and re-engagement; cost is the empty pocket and the ache of pruning. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of persistence versus erasure emerges from concrete particulars: drone crater vs. cypress roots, photograph vs. living leaf. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the child’s misreading and Lena’s silence deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature—salt, resin, sting—remains consistent. No POV leakage; free indirect style is clean. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or emotion. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar trauma-recovery arc is transformed through arboretum ecology and somatic technique; synthesis feels inevitable. Specificity of drone wedding and fig trees anchors universals. Risk in quiet ending pays off via Charged Poise.</comment>
