<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers “rolling a charred stick” and the stick’s “grain blackened into stories” reveal motive and flaw. The contradiction between exposing truth and deepening darkness is dramatized in the miner’s lunge and Elias’s subsequent micro-choice to loosen the strings. Cost is felt when he pockets the still-glowing stick, accepting complicity. Minor slip: the “serene” trait is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias renounces manipulative clarity and chooses visible seams, foreclosing the prior tactic with the image of the glowing stick carried into dark. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of light/dark, told/heard, builds density until the final reconfiguration. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. One causal micro-turn: reversing the stick into embers signals the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dome’s “rusted ribs” and salt-flat void are filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias; acoustics and history constrain his puppet strategy. The campfire stick functions as micro-setting that alters tactics—its warmth and scars guide his decision. Sensory hierarchy is tight: damp wool, bitter ale, meteor hush. Final image of wind “carrying unfinished names” recharges the setting’s erased footprints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling versus manipulation—tightens when the miner’s rage exposes the cost of Elias’s “half-lit” method. Escalation is one deepening: from confident puppeteer to man who “let the puppets stumble.” Visible price: the miner’s accusation and Elias’s loss of certainty. Agency drives the turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the friction between truth as blade versus string; no direct statement, only the final image of “some tales weren’t meant to be told, only carried.” Subtext in the stick’s glow and the dome’s deafness reweights the premise. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—ethical cost is felt, not sermonized. Final meteor hush offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—calligrapher’s precision in “letters seemed to breathe,” rhythmic control in “salt flats stretched white and endless.” Perceptual signature selective: Elias notices grain of wood, acoustics, smoke scent. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Compression taught early (“quiet that follows a shouting match”) and paid off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motive. No loops or scaffold; “charred tip still glowing like a secret” does triple duty. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for reflection, fragments for pivot. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” thought line, but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf Cold-War dome as shrine to misheard stories—is fresh synthesis. Puppet shows in seedy bar transform familiar artist-seeks-truth arc. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off: final image of wind carrying unfinished names feels inevitable. No close echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
