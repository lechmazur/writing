<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. professional detachment—are dramatized in the moment she withholds physical comfort; Elias’s trembling fingers and final “Stay for the dawn?” crystallize a credible shift in their crucible. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids therapy-speak. The cost of apology is felt in the empty vial and shared shovel.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the orchard will still fall, but the current of apology has re-rooted their relationship. Causal chain holds—perfume used → tendrils weave → trees shudder → apple falls—each beat tightening options until the final image of passing the shovel. Cost is legible in the spent bottle and irrevocable dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive’s “yellowed paper and old roses” and the orchard’s “branches heavy with fruit no one would ever taste” are selective, sensory, and thematically charged. The perfume bottle itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivering an imperfect apology before the orchard falls—is signaled early and tightened by the literal ticking clock. The single decisive turn is Elias accepting the tendril; cost is the shared knowledge that the trees will still be cut. Pressure escalates under causal lens without external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect reconnection emerges through concrete action (perfume, shovel) rather than statement. Final image of “the orchard humming beneath the pavement” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in who was more wrong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded; sensory diction (“liquid twilight,” “green tang of sap”) remains within Mara’s perceptual range. Dialogue carries subtext (“You could’ve just said sorry”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is disciplined—only where it sharpens the moment. Final paragraph earns its quiet cadence.</comment>

<comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” and cursed sheet-music archive synthesize fresh angles on familiar tropes. The perfume-as-current metaphor is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the closure image. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
