<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—absorbing guilt yet fearing his own shadow—drives every beat; the embodied unhooking of knots is a visceral micro-choice that forecloses his old role. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: he lets the lens gather dust, trading certainty for shared vulnerability. Secondary pressure from the woman is brief but sufficient to shift status. Only the “sincerely insincere” label is asserted more than dramatized, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias renounces the lighthouse’s absolute guidance, signaled by the dust on the lens and the pulse of the beam. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each unravelled thread reweights the dominant stake until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality is tight: shard whispers → unhooking → quilt of doubt. Cost is legible in the wavering beam and the cold tea.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse, wind chimes, and tide function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the chimes’ frantic trill forces Elias outside; the half-buried cloak anchors the unhooking ritual. Sensory detail is selective—salt foam, lantern pulse—filtered through Elias’s professional eye. The final image of the beam as question, not answer, charges the closure. No environmental detail is wasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias can relinquish borrowed certainties—is signaled early and tightened by each unhooked knot. Agency is continuous: every tug dissolves a specific regret and narrows his future role. The cost is visible in the dissolving threads and the flickering beam. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals are needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: certainty versus nuance, carried through the lighthouse’s shift from warning to invitation. The quilt of doubt reweights the cloak image without moralizing. Subtext in the woman’s empty-handed arrival crystallizes the new pact. Final resonance—“learning the shape of dark”—is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; phrases like “sincerely insincere” and “protected vulnerability” are taught early and paid off. Compression (“Here, there is room for uncertainty”) is purposeful. No head-hopping; the woman’s dialogue is spare yet distinct. Minor elevation in diction is consistent with Elias’s reflective lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image, emotion, and motion. No loops or scaffold; “the tide pulled at something half-buried” advances both plot and metaphor. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during unhooking, longer breaths at dawn. Only a single mixed metaphor (“beam sliced the waves like a blade”) nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire premise is transformed through tactile ritual and sonic code; the shard-as-earpiece feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in letting the lighthouse “fail” as guide heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity—wind-chime grammar, salt-foam dissolution—anchors universals. No derivative echoes.</comment>
