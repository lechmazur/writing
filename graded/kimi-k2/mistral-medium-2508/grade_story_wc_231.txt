<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—his need to keep the lighthouse yet release the stranger’s memory—are shown in embodied micro-choices (fingers tracing petals, adjusting the lens). The final Charged Poise feels earned because every action earlier—steeping the boutonnière, re-pinning it, lingering the beam—demonstrates the cost of acceptance and transmission. Interiority is precise and character-particular, avoiding sentimentality or therapeutic gloss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the boutonnière crumbles, carrying the memory out with the beam. Because/therefore linkages are implied but never break; the final image legibly pays the conceptual cost of accepting transience. No causality gap; orientation is stable by ~80 words. Lens stays coherent to end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The opal dock, Fresnel mechanics, and boutonnière petals are concrete and constrain choice: slick planks force caution while crumbling petals force the decision to transmit the memory. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the dock’s “vein of forgotten bone” recharges the final image. Micro-setting (light apparatus, flower) actively shapes tactics, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias transmit the borrowed memory or hoard it—is signaled early and tightens once. Pressure accumulates via the tide-like swelling of memory fragments until the final choice forecloses hoarding. No false coincidences; agency remains Elias’s throughout. Cost is felt when his hands “tremble” and the flower is re-pinned, a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>“Borrowed memories as temporary burden” grows organically from the boutonnière, the lighthouse’s isolation ethic, and Elias’s keeper mythology. No direct statement guides reader; theme surfaces in the quiet transfer of the memory “like the last breath of a drowning man.” Final image reframes all prior accumulation without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual texture—opalescence, driftwood roughness, magnified petal veins—creates a lyrical POV faithful to Elias’s observational cast. Syntax modulates with urgency (“Then he climbed… adjusted the lens”). Patterned ellisions (stranger’s voice) are taught and paid off at closure with no head-hop.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Virtually zero padding—each line advances image or motive, e.g., “He steeped the boutonnière in saltwater—an old trick…” Variation in rhythm supports the slow build of tension. No loops or synonym churn; metaphors (“vein of forgotten bone,” last breath reprise) are precise and cumulative, never contradictory.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>This borrowed-memory/keeper transmission angle feels inevitable only within these particular textures and tensions; swap dock or flower and the emotional calculus would fracture. The synthesis is specific, non-obvious, and reconfigures lighthouse lore rather than restating it.</comment>
