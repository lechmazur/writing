<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingers on the lamp, the weights in her ribs—but the moment she realizes “I am the loom” arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elira’s shift from collector to vessel is legible, irreversible, and carries the cost of permanent fusion with the grotto. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each calcified burden layers the hush until the final cadence dissolves it into starlight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto’s plates, the lamp burner, and the starlit fissures are not backdrop but instruments: the plates breathe her in, the burner re-orients the flame, the cracks channel the weights outward. Micro-setting as crucible fully achieved.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elira’s need to unload burdens—tightens when the grotto demands she become the loom instead. The pressure deepens via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversal; the cost is her human boundary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of bearing versus becoming emerges through concrete action: the lamp’s flame, the calcified grief, the final cradle of hush. No moralizing; the whalebone reverie reweights the premise without pronouncement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“shingled hush,” “whalebone harp”—and stays rooted in Elira’s perceptual field. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each image performs double duty. No loops, no mixed metaphors. The only near-slip is “boundary-lessly trapped,” a coined adverbial that momentarily stalls rhythm, but it is absorbed by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver conceit, the bronze grotto as living archive, and the lamp burner as soul-loom synthesize into a singular vision. Risky lyric mode is fully committed and pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
