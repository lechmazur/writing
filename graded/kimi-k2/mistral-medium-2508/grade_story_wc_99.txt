<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied and specific—his calloused hands, the way he “doesn’t want to crush a seed between his teeth.” The contradiction between his need to bend the bonsai and his fear of snapping it mirrors his unspoken guilt. The final micro-choice—planting the compass—earns the apology he could never voice, with visible cost (the compass is gone, the tree now bears the color of regret). One slip: the brother is off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent; score capped at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass’s gold bleeds into cerulean, the bonsai’s leaves turn the exact blue of a held-back apology, and Elias’s stance toward memory is forever altered. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern, image, and cadence tighten until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is palpable—the compass is surrendered to the roots. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The islet’s post-rain damp, the saltgrass combed by wind, and the brass warmth of the compass all filter through Elias’s grief-sharpened senses. The bonsai pot becomes micro-setting, constraining the final act of burial. Weather and object states evolve causally. One minor slip: “drowned blue” horizon is vivid but slightly generic; keeps it just under 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry an unspoken apology—tightens when the compass’s lace pattern offers a method. The single deepening beat: the needle bleeding color forces Elias to choose between keeping the relic or letting it root. The cost is the loss of the compass and the irreversible tint of the leaves. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tactile particulars: bonsai, compass lace, tide charts. The final image of blue leaves offers a non-literal answer to how regret can be voiced. Subtext is carried in gesture—planting the compass instead of speaking. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. One hairline slip: “the exact blue of a held-back I’m sorry” flirts with over-articulation but is earned by prior image work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elias’s slow, salt-rough diction. Syntax mirrors his caution: long voweled phrases, then clipped fragments under pressure. No POV leakage; every detail is filtered through his selective attention. The patterned elision of the brother’s name heightens rather than obscures. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; each image does double duty. “The wind combing through the saltgrass like fingers through a lover’s hair” is fresh and character-bound. No loops or scaffold. One near-miss: “drowned blue” could be crisper. Otherwise, high information density with zero artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bonsai craft, tide-chart lace, and compass-as-memory-device is non-obvious and specific. The transformation of the compass from navigation tool to root-bound apology is fresh. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than causal reversals, and it pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
