<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—spectacle-adjusting, scarf-touching, chalk-tasting tea—but the decisive shift from hoarder to “fold in the story” is asserted more than dramatized; the cost (loneliness cured) is felt yet slightly under-cooked on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library becomes a living mouth, Elias a “necessary crease.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of remembered objects reweights the stake—though the causal leap from reading silences to full spatial warp could be one beat clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library’s tessellated walls, liquid-amber sun, and fractal carpet actively warp under the scarf’s geometry, constraining Elias’s final choice to leave the restricted section unlocked; sensory selection is tight and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“how to reawaken memories”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the scarf dissolves and Elias must decide to share the living archive. Cost is visible (loss of sole possession) yet could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-space emerges organically from fractal scarf and hyperbolic shelves; final image of the library “chewing silence into something sweet” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—mathematical incantations, synesthetic taste of chalk—remains consistent; lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor loop (“the library wasn’t just a building anymore. It was a mouth”) risks paraphrase, but rhythm and specificity carry the closure beat cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of geometry, grief, and bibliophilia; the scarf’s fractal threads reincarnating into grout and wood grain feels inevitable yet non-obvious, earning the risk of spatial warp.</comment>
