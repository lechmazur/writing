<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is embodied and specific—rough hands, cold hairpin, the hollow carved by screams. The final choice to give the silver fruit to the arsonist is earned by her spiral-shaped grief and the shoot’s dissolution into her veins. The only cap is that the man’s presence is off-stage until the final beat, limiting relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silver fruit in the arsonist’s hand reweights every prior loss into forward motion. Causal chain holds—hairpin → shoot → dissolution → fruit → transfer—each step narrowing options with visible cost. No orientation debt; the grotto’s rules are taught through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s bioluminescent moss and scalloped vines constrain Maren’s movements and mirror her scars. The single silver fruit on the fig tree exterior charges the final image, tying setting to closure. Micro-setting (hairpin, moss, fruit) functions as geography in miniature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the “source before the drawing”—is signaled early and tightened when the shoot dissolves into her veins, foreclosing passive peace. Cost is visceral: the grotto trembles, vines recoil, hairpin vanishes. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges through concrete particulars: scalloped edges on pin, scars, and new shoot. Final image of Maren scalloping a bandage while awaiting dawn’s children offers non-literal answer—grief scallops joy, joy feeds roots. No moralizing; resonance is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Maren’s tactile perception—“rough hands,” “wine into water.” Patterned elision (e.g., the voice that asks “What do you seek?”) is taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final cadence is quiet but charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances character or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; “scalloped” recurrence is purposeful, not repetitive. Metaphors are coherent—“spiral, not a wound but a cradle.” Minor elevated diction (“umbral”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebirth trope is transformed through specific sensory detail and moral complexity: the arsonist releasing doves, Maren gifting the fruit. The scallop motif threads organically from hairpin to shoot to bandage. Risky quiet ending lands with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
