<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—she “hopes to be the one who finds the cracks stories slip through rather than the one writing them”—is clearly conveyed, but the interior contradiction between her stated passivity and her active trading remains implied rather than dramatized. Emotions feel embodied in the tactile contact with tools and moonlight, yet her final stance is more stance crystallization than personal renunciation; cost is conceptual (she refrains from opening her own vial) but not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the slate’s fracture reweights the library’s premise—silence now visible as currency. Causality threads cleanly from bottled moonlight exchange → obsidian cut → fracture appearing; the final refusal to open the kept vial locks the cost without contradiction. Orientation is handled gracefully; the sky “swirling like pages” returns as the re-charged closing canvas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Glass branches, quartz counter, bottled moonlight shelf create tactile pressure while remaining micro-setting objects; the cloud-orbit library serves as backdrop rather than tactical constraint. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV-filtered; it subtly constrains only Liora’s decision not to descend, hence mid-high.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—selling silence—tightens in a single, visible beat: the patron’s hunger vs Liora’s choice to keep the moonlight. Cost is legible (the fracture replaces loss with captured absence), but absence cannot wound on the page like a missing eye; intensity feels moderate rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from traded absences and the ethics of commodifying pause; the library itself is the emblem. No overt commentary, only gesture and image. The ending reweights “where stories begin” without stating a moral. Only minor drift to 7.6 due to absence of deeper social complication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Distinct lyric voice threaded through synesthesia (“ink and ozone”) and tactile verbs. POV stays intimate; no head-hop. Rhythm rises and falls under pressure, pausing on “inhaling possibility” then accelerating to the chime. Register remains controlled, no filter-verb leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is supple, information-dense, and nearly clean of loops; only two minor repeated sentence stems (“She already knew the answer. / It was always the same.”) register as deliberate refrain, not artifact. Density earns 8.1; one half-point off for micro-redundancy at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing a floating library of crystalline bookshelves with monetized silence and fracture-as-currency feels fresh; the synthesis is coherent and inevitable. Only a fractional deduction for the slight overlap with other quiet-shop fantasies; the specific ethical twist keeps risk high.</comment>
