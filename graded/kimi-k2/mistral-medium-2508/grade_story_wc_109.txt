<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eldrin’s obsession with silence is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing gold leaf, pressing stone—and his final renunciation lands as Earned Stasis. Interiority is specific, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure. The cost (dissolving into quiet) is felt yet abstract, slightly undercutting visceral stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence layer thickens the ambered hush until the final erasure reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eldrin releases the booklet and becomes “another layer of quiet,” a visible conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric but coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The ridge fort’s salt-pocked stones and flaking gold leaf function as micro-setting that constrains Eldrin’s map-making and absorbs the defender’s vigil. Sensory detail is selective—wet stone, old iron, gilded snow—filtered through his obsession. The fort’s memory of the defender charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping the endless night—tightens as each silence is recorded and then released. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the map is in erasure, not accumulation, narrows options and forces renunciation. Cost is conceptual but legible; pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as both wound and cradle, the futility of naming the unnameable. Subtext lives in gesture—the booklet slipping away, gold leaf on stone—without moralizing. Final image reweights prior silences into a single ambered hush, offering resonant non-literal closure.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the ambered hush. Perceptual signature is distinct: Eldrin notices “the aftertaste of a struck bell” and “gilded snow.” No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final dissolution.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers silence without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“gold leaf flaked onto his lap like gilded snow”—and serve the texture. No loops or scaffold; minor register elevation is voice-motivated. Closure beat is unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartography of silence—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of oracle and last-star apocalypse are transformed through tactile specificity and conceptual repricing. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; synthesis is singular and memorable.</comment>
