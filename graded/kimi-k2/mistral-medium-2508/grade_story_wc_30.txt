<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—ritual mastery vs. the creel’s refusal to be solved—drives every beat; the final refusal to inscribe the woman crystallizes his stance with felt cost. Yet the woman remains a cipher; her motives never press him, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each object-layer thickens meaning until the spoon’s trembling drop reconfigures “tomorrow” into held light. Closure is a Charged Poise; the cost is the moon-weight settling back into Elias’s ribs, unmistakable in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium’s glass, tide-pools, and fractal dawn are not backdrop; they leak into Elias’s bones and dictate the crucible’s heat. Micro-setting (creel, brass dials) constrains the smelt and charges the final reflection on the water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to keep wonder alive in routine—tightens when the woman demands the “almost” spoon; Elias’s choice to surrender tomorrow’s first second visibly forecloses his prior hoarding. Pressure is coherent, one deepening, no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of identity-migration emerges through objects that shed skins; the spoon’s drop of future-time reframes the ledger as living archive. No moralizing—only the quiet insistence that wonder survives by being spent, not stored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is oceanic, metallic, precise: “brass dials embedded in his forearm—each tick a quiet rebellion” teaches the pattern early. Syntax breathes with tide-rhythm; no head-hop, no filter-verb fog. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is purposeful and patterned; no mixed metaphors or loops. “Liquid opals,” “lunar hiccup,” and “sugar dissolving” all serve atmosphere without clogging propulsion. Final image—“a sliver of silver, a held breath”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing maritime myth, clockwork body-mod, and ontological bookkeeping feels inevitable yet fresh. The creel-as-skin-shedder and moon-phase bone-weight are specific inventions, not trope pastiche. Risky lyric compression pays off in clarity.</comment>
