<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s tactile perception and quiet refusal of recognition create a credible, embodied interiority; the micro-choice to realign the array without seeking credit crystallizes his values and costs him visibility. The hummingbird drone acts as an extension of his senses, but its agency never overshadows his. The final beat—picking up the broken watch—earns a resonant stasis that forecloses any triumphal arc. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, preventing the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the corridor of golden clarity reconfigures the stakes for everyone except Elias, whose stance crystallizes in quiet return to work. Causal linkage holds: misalignment → tactile diagnosis → patch → corrected beam → departure. Orientation is swift and spatial choreography clean. Cost is felt in Elias’s deliberate anonymity, though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The mist, depot, and water barrel function as micro-settings that constrain perception and enable Elias’s refraction technique; the barrel in particular charges the final image by splitting the wake. Sensory selection is biased by touch and vibration, keeping description purposeful. World rules (light-bending film, drone optics) remain consistent and learned through action. The environment never merely decorates; it shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ship’s safe departure—tightens once when Elias chooses to intervene despite personal cost. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each beat narrows from detection to correction to silent exit. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence complicates visibility but does not resolve. The price (renounced recognition) is legible but understated, keeping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: craftsmanship as quiet service versus spectacle. Subtext lives in gesture—the patch applied with thumbs that “memorized a thousand repairs.” The final image of the watch reframes the voyage as merely one more broken thing awaiting attention. No moralizing intrudes; resonance arises from the understated cost of anonymity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and consistent in perceptual signature: “the way the mist curled cooler near the boots.” Compression is purposeful; elisions (how Elias navigates the crowd) are paid off by the cane’s tapping rhythm. No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but brass-voiced captain serves as foil without flattening the narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“hummingbird’s wings a blur of precision gears.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the patch, exhaling in the final return to shop. High density without clutter.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of blind artisan, light-bending film, and drone-mediated perception feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (maiden voyage, misty dock) are transformed through tactile POV and understated heroism. Specificity of the iridescent film and water-refraction diagnosis anchors the speculative tech in lived craft. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks obscure clarity.</comment>
