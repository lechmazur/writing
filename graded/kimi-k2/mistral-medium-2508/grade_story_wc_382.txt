<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger to “understand” his inherited building and his readiness to lie about a sugar loan are clearly motivated, but Veyra’s opacity drags the score: a “dead tutor” who never bleeds, tires, or betrays a genuine fear reads more archetype than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure is clear: the rooftop cyclically reclaims its mentor, a Charged Poise that reconfigures Elias’s fate—becoming the next vessel—yet the causal chain between “signing with the seal” and this inherited curse is too lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rooftop wisteria and ink-steam tea conjure a seductive gothic hush, but the brownstone itself never steps forward as a sensate antagonist; its grief is told more by summary than constraining detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“to learn the language of old buildings”—pressures Elias into an unbreakable contract; the cost (becoming steward-seducer of future learners) is implied, but not viscerally suffered on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The refrain that “lies are agreements” re-emerges in the final coda, re-weighting Elias’s smile into quiet damnation—an earned resonance without bald moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The POV’s compressed lyricism—“steam curling into forgotten letters”—maintains a consistent incantatory register that distinguishes narrator from tutors; any ellipses of space/time feel intentional, not leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely supple and artifact-free, though occasional phrase stacks (“patiently nimble”) and a touch of thesaurus shimmer (“crystallized silhouette”) lightly bruise clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The story’s true ingenuity lies in treating architectural language as occult interrogation, a fresh synthesis that transforms familiar goth-mentor tropes into cyclic inheritance horror.</comment>
