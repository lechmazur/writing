<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the need to keep mapping—are embodied in the tremor of his hands and the taped bellows; the final right-turn renunciation is earned by the graffiti trail and the sister’s remembered accusation, carrying visible cost in the cracked-earth bed of the Blackthorn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias turns right, foreclosing the mapped path; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the ivy, graffiti, and bellows accrue meaning until the final image reweights the premise with felt cost—“not forgiveness, but a beginning.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station’s sagging roof and ivy-choked tracks constrain every step; the bellows function as micro-setting, their groaning tape charging the final image when Elias presses his forehead to the patched leather, making the absent river present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through graffiti clues that force a choice: left for bravery, right for sorry; the final turn right narrows options and carries the cost of never looking back, legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through stains on timetables and the river’s dried bed; the final image of ivy parting offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise through embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is river-chronicler precise—“the way water left stains on old timetables”—with a perceptual signature that filters every detail through drought-haunted guilt; rhythm modulates from languid reflection to the creak of the bellows under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—“sunlight filtering through in jagged patches, illuminating the graffiti like a code”—with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful, never muddling the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The drought-struck chronicler seeking absolution via graffiti prophecy feels fresh; the accordion bellows as scarred witness and the river that “learns to walk” transform familiar eco-grief into a singular, inevitable trajectory.</comment>
