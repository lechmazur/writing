<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veythas’s interior contradiction—loyalty to Lirien versus duty to the throne—drives every beat; the whispered name is a costly micro-choice that forecloses both friendship and false sovereignty. Embodied emotion (“breath that tasted of dust and old promises”) grounds his stoic mythic stature in palpable grief. The final kneeling and gathering of shards shows earned renunciation with visible cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the scepter cracks, the pretender’s mask slips, and the library exhales “a new kind of stillness.” Causal chain—messages → recognition of Lirien → sacrifice of her name → sundering—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the shattered basalt and the carved epitaph. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; deliberate disorientation (time folding) pays off in the stuttering constellations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library’s collapsing shelves and drifting constellations are not backdrop but active constraint: the rune of drift literally alters tactical options. Micro-setting (dragonhide tome, oculus light) is filtered through Veythas’s tactile ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and object states track. Final light through the broken roof recharges the opening image of “a god’s discarded robe,” crystallizing closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—tightens with each ink message until the final choice narrows to “sunder or be sundered.” Agency is renunciation: Veythas sacrifices Lirien’s name to break the lie. Cost is visible in the cracked scepter and the pretender’s relief. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s cost emerges from the concrete act of breaking a crown; no moral is stated. The epitaph “Here the lie ended” reweights all prior warnings into a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the ink’s corrosive bite and the pretender’s slipped mask. Ambiguity lingers: was the throne ever real?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lapidary and mythic yet precise: “regally unpretentious,” “ink that ate through lies.” Syntax mirrors Veythas’s stone-still patience, then fractures with the library’s shudder. No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression (“three hundred years ignoring”) is taught early and paid off in the final stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“shelves sagging under the weight of scrolls older than memory”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent and grounded. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar mythic tropes—titan, lost library, false king—are transformed through tactile specificity and temporal drift mechanics. The ink pellet as message medium feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risky compression of centuries into one scene pays off in the charged final image. Synthesis feels both ancient and startlingly new.</comment>
