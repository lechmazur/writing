<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the chisel-slip and crack crystallize grief in action. The spectral mentorship feels earned within family custom, and the final micro-choice—adding his own poem—carries visible cost. Minor slip: “fiercely meditative” is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone becomes a vessel, grief reweighted from wound to door. Causal chain holds—butterfly gift → dinner trade → daughter’s tremble—under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, wet soil, and jasmine scent constrain mood and action; cracked granite and butterfly wings charge the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no static cataloguing. Micro-setting (stone, ribbon) doubles as emotional crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to shape collective grief—tightens when the carver shifts from carving names to carving hollows. One decisive intensification: the crack in the stone forces the tactic change. Cost is felt in the butterfly pressed into his palm and the poem added to the roll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the hollowed stone, the ribbon’s poems, the butterfly trade. Final image of the door reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the father’s “space between lines” line carries generational wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet grounded in chisel-calloused fingers and wet earth. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for reflection, clipped fragments at the crack. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to the carver.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Minor elevated diction (“bruised violet”) fits the heightened moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familial spectral mentorship and poem-trading ritual feel fresh, not tropey. The butterfly-as-currency and grief-as-hollow synthesis are specific to this voice. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
