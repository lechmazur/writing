<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the custodian’s loneliness and retrocognitive gift drive every micro-choice. The final laugh crystallizes her shift from rescue to pattern-recognition, with the mended prism as felt cost. One minor slip: “retrocognitively blessed” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon’s flare reweights the past from loss to meaning. Causal chain (prism fracture ↔ transmission death ↔ star alignment) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the cooling prism and the custodian’s tomorrow-return vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Glass-worn stairs, salt wind, and star-carved floor anchor place and constrain motion. The pavilion’s hum and the prism’s hush act as micro-settings that shape every beat. Final image of rain-scented wind recharges the tower’s song without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—prove coincidences carry meaning—tightens when the beacon flares and the constellations align to her mother’s birth-night. Escalation is one decisive intensification; cost is the irreversible solitude after the light fades. Agency remains hers: she chooses to climb again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: fractures contain design, collapse holds meaning. Subtext lives in the prism’s hush and the pavilion’s song. Final image of rain after years of drought offers non-literal hope without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through salt-worn glass and retrocognitive ache. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during ignition, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hop; diction stays within custodian’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors (thistle-blown hope, shard of hush) are fresh and coherent. Zero loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the beacon’s fade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Post-apocalyptic retrocognitive beacon-tender is fresh synthesis; collapse as cosmic pattern-recognition engine feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
