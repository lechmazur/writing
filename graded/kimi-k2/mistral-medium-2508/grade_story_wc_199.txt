<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the moonstone’s warmth against her cheek and her micro-choice to climb anchor motivation. The final transformation into vine-woven skin shows earned change with visible cost. Yet the absence of contradictory impulses in-scene keeps her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s leap re-weights the hush from pause to inhale, and the sapling’s first word “begin” crystallizes new stakes. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each seed tower beat tightens pattern toward the arbor’s groan and ladder of roots. Cost is legible in the monuments’ dissolution and her own bark-dappled skin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ashen arbor’s floating roots and parchment sky are rendered with tactile specificity; the moonstone’s warmth and seed hums constrain choices. Environment becomes micro-setting when the bark splits into silver runes that guide her climb. Final image of a humming sapling grove recharges earlier motifs with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ prophecy—tightens when the moonstone unlocks their language, forcing a climb that forecloses safe return. Escalation is driven by her agency: each seed selected and monument built raises stakes until the arbor answers with a ladder. Cost is felt in the monuments’ liquefaction and her bodily transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sorting is revealed as stewardship of stories ready to root, not mere order. The final ingestion of a sapling leaf reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture—tucking the speck in her cheek like her grandmother—charging the ending’s resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature shows in “seeds that sang when rolled between her fingers.” Syntax modulates with pressure, compressing as she climbs. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Liora’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“sky the color of old parchment”) are coherent and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates during the climb, mirroring urgency without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of seed-sorting, floating arbor, and moonstone key feels inevitable in hindsight. Folklore fragments are transformed through specific character stakes rather than ornament. Risk-taking in bodily transformation pays off, reconfiguring the hush from pause to genesis.</comment>
