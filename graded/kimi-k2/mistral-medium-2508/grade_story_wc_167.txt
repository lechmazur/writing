<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—calloused fingers, oilcloth apron, stone like a forgotten promise—but the decisive micro-choice (dropping the stone) is under-motivated; we feel his need to commune yet never see the cost of that act foreclose a path. The daughter’s absence is evoked rather than dramatized, so the emotional pivot rests on memory rather than present pressure. Still, the embodied contradictions (stoic steadiness vs. longing) are specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added prism, ripple, and color flare thickens the pattern until the final pulse reweights the bay’s “memory.” Closure is a Charged Poise—the flare that briefly reveals the returning boat—whose cost is the inevitable swallowing of color by mist; the before/after is legible as Elias’s quiet certainty against the world’s erasure. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is not backdrop but lung-like enclosure; mist, groaning walkway, and salt-damp glass constrain every breath and footstep. The atrium’s prisms act as micro-setting that literally bends choice—Elias aligns the final prism because the walls dictate where light can land. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: fishermen’s wives’ worry arrives as jagged ripples, not exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding value in the mundane—tightens when the stone’s ripples translate into wind-shift and tide; the cost is the knowledge that the harbor will forget, yet Elias endures that loss. One clear escalation: mist thickens, prism flare reveals boat, day begins—options narrow from private communion to public labor. Agency is attention itself, renouncing any larger claim on the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: meaning is not extracted but refracted, held in attention’s prism. Subtext lives in gesture—stone sinking, daughter’s between-the-lines letter—never in commentary. Final image reweights the premise: the mundane (wet crate thud) is illuminated only because Elias paid the cost of solitary witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is salt-rough, rhythmic, and compressed: “the bay exhaled, the mist rose.” Perceptual signature is precise—Elias reads ripples like handwriting—without ever slipping into omniscience. Syntax modulates with tide and breath, achieving lyric control without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers glass, water, or light. Figurative language is sparse, exact: “mist curled around his boots like an old man’s bones.” No mixed metaphors, no filler. Final line lands clean, recharging “quiet certainty” without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The prism-atrium as secular oracle feels inevitable yet fresh; the notion that attention itself is communion reframes the familiar “harbor at dawn” without gimmickry. Specificity of salvaged shipwreck glass and noctilucent reckonings prevents trope drift. Risk is quiet—lyric accumulation rather than plot twist—but fully committed.</comment>
