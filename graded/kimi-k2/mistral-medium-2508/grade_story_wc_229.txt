<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—calloused fingers on cork, throat ache from “holding the note”—and his renunciation of the cork at the end is earned by the prior demonstration of intent’s power. Harkin’s single-scene arc from skeptic to pocketing the cork supplies a credible micro-relationship crucible. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“he knew better”) early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lighthouse shifts from warning to invitation, cost visible in Harkin’s softened skepticism and Elias’s relinquishing of the cork. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (lavender, jasmine) thickens until the final dawn ache reweights the premise. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn-cooled glass, and salt-lavender air are filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias and constrain his non-horn method. Micro-setting (lantern-room glass, cork ridges) functions as charged object-terrain. Garden scent memory is specific yet integrated, not postcard filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers trump shouts—tightens when Elias risks the fishermen’s safety and his own credibility; the boats’ slow turn is the single meaningful escalation. Cost is felt: throat ache, relinquished talisman, Harkin’s humbled silence. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the quiet power of intention over brute force. Subtext lives in gesture—Harkin pocketing the cork, fishermen’s slower hands—never in exposition. Final image of “gardens yet to be planted” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“tender, screaming only in its precision”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices vibrations, scents, minute temperature shifts. No head-hopping; Harkin’s interiority is implied through action and scent-triggered wonder only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned early (vibrations, garden scent) and paid off. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“bruise against the pale dawn”) is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—lighthouse keeper using inherited cork and scent-magic to call boats—feels fresh, grounded in sensory specificity. Transformation test fails if relocated: the cobalt tower, cork, and garden scent are irreplaceable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
