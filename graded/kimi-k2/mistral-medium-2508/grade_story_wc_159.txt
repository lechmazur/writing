<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—devotion to preservation vs. the need to silence—are embodied in the tremor of her hands and the final act of letting the chime fall. The interiority is specific, never clinical, and the renunciation carries a palpable cost. The flaw (over-devotion) directly triggers the climax, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora’s deliberate destruction of the chime seals the library’s fate and her own exile from purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sound and silence reweights the stake—and the cost is legible in the sunlight gilding “ruins.” Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal library, moonstone shelves, and glass-orchids are not backdrop; their brittleness and translucence constrain Liora’s every move and charge the final image when the last orchid shatters. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (the chime itself) functions as setting and tool, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. silence the forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens through the chime’s escalating song. The single decisive turn (breaking the chime) narrows options irreversibly. Cost is visible in the splintered bamboo and the sunlight that exposes the library’s hollowness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation can become a form of violence. The final image of sunlight on wreckage reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from “museum of extinct feelings” to cradle that must be left to sleep. No thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to fragility and echo. Syntax mirrors Liora’s careful movements and later collapse. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Compression and elision are taught early (“half-remembered dream”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are controlled and purposeful (“shattered rainbows,” “foxglove regret”). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph’s cadence shift lands the closure beat cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of sound-archaeology and emotional preservation feels inevitable and fresh. The deserted marvels trope is transformed through tactile specificity and the inversion of caretaker into destroyer. Risk-taking (lyric density, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
