<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied and particular; the “surgeon’s precision” and “heretic’s compassion” are dramatized through tactile mosaicking and the micro-choice to speak each name. The contradiction between mercy and steel is lived in the final kneel with the commander. One slip: the phrase “grief, too, could be a weapon” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the commander’s kneel and the tesserae glowing gold reweight the plaza from wound to cradle. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each named stone layers density until the pattern itself reconfigures power. Orientation is swift; the plaza, sky, and Elias’s task are anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the commander’s dropped sword and Elias’s unhealed fingers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plaza’s shattered minaret and mosaic stones are rendered through Elias’s fingertips; every sensory note (charred cedar, cold tesserae, dust) constrains his kneeling posture and the act of naming. The sky’s fracture mirrors the internal stakes without overt symbolism. Micro-setting—the cobalt tessera functioning as the minaret’s eye—charges the final image when it glows.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: to reclaim the dead from erasure by renaming them into stone. Pressure tightens when soldiers arrive; Elias’s agency is the refusal to stop, forcing the commander’s micro-turn. Cost is visible in broken fingers and the commander’s kneel. Escalation is accumulative: each named tessera increases the plaza’s hum until the mosaic itself becomes antagonist and ally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mercy and erasure; the final glow of the stones offers a non-literal answer—memory as living mercy. Subtext resides in the commander’s hesitation and the sword’s clatter. No final moralizing; the image of cracks filling with gold reweights the premise without dictating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail; the syntax tightens under pressure (“Steel lived in his bones now”). Free indirect style stays consistent. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual—Elias’s “Go ahead” carries layered defiance and invitation. No head-hopping; the commander’s interiority surfaces only through observable gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; “smoke still curled like a dying prayer” risks purple but earns its place by anchoring tone. Rhythm modulates from long, breath-held lines to the staccato of naming. Minor filter-verb clusters (“had once been,” “had survived”) are forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—memory-as-mosaic, mercy-as-reclamation—feels fresh and inevitable. The tesserae as living archive transforms a familiar post-catastrophe frame. Risk in the lyrical mode pays off: the stones’ hum and golden cracks reconfigure the plaza into a collective cradle. No derivative echoes; the final image is singular.</comment>
