<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—oil-stained fingers, the yoyo’s burn—while the contradictory pull between curiosity and self-erasure charges every beat. His final step onto the hunger stone is a credible renunciation foreshadowed by earlier glimpses of “time sticking like tar.” The interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. Cost is felt in the erased reflection and the world’s backward clocks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s crossing reweights fate itself, signaled by the lighthouse gears reversing and clocks running backward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift replace causal chains—yet the final image makes the cost undeniable. Orientation is anchored early; the “splinter in the throat of the sea” grounds us. No causality breaks or late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse, hunger stones, and yoyo form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: stones reveal a path only at low tide, gears catch the yoyo’s spin. Sensory detail is selective—bruised violet light, cold fire—filtered through Elias’s urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; the tide’s return erases the path with causal precision. Environment charges the final image as the beam winks out forever.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stepping beyond fate—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened by each backward spin. The single decisive turn is Elias’s step onto the stone, which forecloses return; cost is the world’s temporal rupture and his own erasure. Pressure grows via the yoyo’s increasing radiance and the stones’ deepening carvings. No coincidence resolves; the tide only seals the irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: obsession as liberation, time as edible rather than absolute. The yoyo’s radiance reweights from puzzle-key to world-key without a moral. Final image—reflection erased by tide—offers a non-literal answer: identity is the price for unmaking destiny. No thematic statements intrude; resonance is earned through action and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “counter-clockwise clockmaker,” “bruised violet,” “the sea forgot his name.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perception stays Elias-bound. Syntax mirrors his spiral obsession—long sentences coil, then snap short at the step.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“lighthouse stood like a splinter in the throat of the sea”—and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final cadence shift—“the lighthouse, at last, was silent”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of yoyo, hunger stones, and time-reversal feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Tropes—obsessed inventor, cursed artifact—are transformed through tactile specificity and temporal stakes. Risk-taking (time unwound by toy) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final backward clocks are a fresh, earned consequence.</comment>
