<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence, ritual with the glass, and final decision to stay are embodied in tactile micro-choices; the contradictory pull between isolation and inherited guardianship is dramatized through stone-stacking and letter-burning. Interiority stays concrete—“glass warm as a pulse”—and the renunciation of the skiff carries visible cost. One slip: the mother memory is summary rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s “I’ll teach you how to stack them higher” crystallizes his shift from solitary keeper to co-caretaker, cost paid by the rotting skiff. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each letter and stone layer thickens pattern until the final candle bends toward the glass. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern room’s rust-smell, broken lens, and stone spiral function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the sea glass in pocket becomes a portable shard of the tower’s light. Sensory selection is urgent—“mist curled against the glass”—and the stones’ hum under wind charges the final image. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bottling safety—tightens when the fourth letter’s spiral map forces Elias upstairs; each new stone narrows his option to leave. Agency is cumulative: burning letters → climbing stairs → adding rock → lighting candle. Cost is the skiff left to rot, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of safety as communal inheritance emerges through the stone spiral and anonymous keepers; no moralizing, only the final invitation “Tomorrow, we build a door.” The sea glass reweights from promise to shared pulse, achieving resonance without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is spare, salt-etched, and consistent—“the oars dipping without ripple”—with perceptual signature in maritime diction and rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; free-indirect compression is clean. The final “tower breathed” sustains lyric authority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences carry double duty—“the stones settling like a held note finally released.” Metaphors are precise and physical; no register drift. Final paragraph cadence mirrors the tower’s breathing, achieving closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse ghost story inverted into collaborative caretaking across time via stone ciphers and sea glass. Risky quiet ending lands because the spiral’s hum and second glass make the inheritance tangible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
