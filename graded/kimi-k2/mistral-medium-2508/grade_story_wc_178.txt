<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Qishti’s frugality and empirical irony are embodied in every micro-choice (counting tiles, stylus tracing), and the final kneel crystallizes an earned shift from measurement to felt devotion; the interior contradiction between scientific habit and mystical surrender is dramatized, not labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile’s disappearance and the star-brightening image reweight the premise with conceptual cost; the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each schematic beat deepens density until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Palace is evoked through cracked mosaics, torchlight, and the damp passage; the tile itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final choice; sensory selection mirrors Qishti’s narrowed attention under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—covenant with the unknown—tightens when the tile’s cipher forces descent; the cost is the abandonment of empirical certainty; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and mystery; the final image of brighter stars offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing; encrypted devotion is reweighted through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is scholarly yet lyrical, with controlled compression (“ink that mapped celestial paths”); perceptual signature is consistent—Qishti’s noticing is filtered through astronomical habit; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“stone groaned like a fruit”); no loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during descent, then exhales at the altar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical science meets buried mystical architecture; the tile-as-key and star-dialogue feel inevitable yet non-obvious; risk-taking (underground altar, living stars) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
