<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “incubate” micro-choice anchors her arc. Motive—recovering the unsent love—remains legible and escalates through tactile interaction with the film. Final renunciation (turning off the projector) is earned by prior psychometry beats and carries quiet cost. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV structure holds; closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s silence after the last reel reweights all prior echoes. Causal chain: psychometry → locating lyrics-as-absence → renunciation. Orientation anchored by ~70 words; no drift. Cost is felt in the hush that replaces the song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Projection booth is rendered through rust, ozone, storm vibration—details that constrain movement and echo emotional pressure. Film strip and crystal function as micro-settings that physically guide choices. Final image of darkness absorbing the beam recharges the motif of “where light can’t fade it.” Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where unused love hides—tightens when Elara discovers the lyrics are stored as absence between frames. One decisive deepening: realizing the letters were never ink but silence. Agency resides in threading the final reel and then choosing darkness. Cost is the irrevocable quiet after the bulb dies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of love stored in unplayed art emerges organically from the film-strip motif and Elara’s psychometry. Subtext operates in the gap between lyric and silence; no moralizing. Final image of “the dark have its say” reweights the premise without explicit statement. Complexity preserved—love is neither wasted nor recovered, simply re-housed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the flicker of the projector. Sensory diction (“ozone,” “frayed like the hem of a memory”) stays within Elara’s perceptual signature. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and loop-free. Metaphors are coherent—celluloid “warming as if alive” sustains the incubation motif. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Minor purple flourish (“thick and golden, like honey left too long”) is earned by context and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—psychometric crystal gazer retrieving unsent love from film—feels fresh yet inevitable. Vintage booth, storm, and lyric-absence synthesize into a singular emotional engine. No derivative echo; risk in quiet ending heightens resonance. Transformation test passed: swap any element and the story collapses.</comment>
