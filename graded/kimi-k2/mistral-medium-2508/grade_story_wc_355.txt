<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—pacifist empathy vs. the need to act—drives every beat; the trembling hand over the sketch and the final “Silence repaired here” sign crystallize a credible renunciation with visible cost. Backstory is kept within BRR limits and always tilts present tactics. Only the off-stage guild fire feels slightly convenient, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias steps into the street with the diary open, the hum in his bones, and the new sign—an earned reconfiguration of his stance. Causal linkage holds (diary → frequency device → clasp → choice → next morning). No orientation drift; the single transition is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The workshop’s slanted roof, copper plate, and gunpowder air constrain every move; the diary itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Only the alley behind the guild is sketched too lightly to fully ground space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what to do when empathy fails—is signaled early and tightens once: the diary’s final entry forces Elias to break his own silence. The cost is the pacifist identity he must renegotiate, visible in the open diary and the sign he posts. No reversals, but one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete catalog of silences; the final image of “careful hands” mending a music box reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the sketch of two hands and the humming device carries the conceptual cost. No thematic drift or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, copper-and-ink specific; perceptual signature (“silences like others collected stamps”) stays consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short bursts under fireworks, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. The single “breathless summer night” cliché is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—cataloging silence via frequency device and diary of vibrations—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (burned guild, pacifist craftsman) are transformed through sensory specificity and the final repair shop. Risk in the lyric structure pays off.</comment>
