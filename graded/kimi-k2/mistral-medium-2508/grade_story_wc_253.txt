<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—stillness vs. the need to scream—are embodied in micro-choices (whittling, climbing the railing) and culminate in the earned renunciation of silence. The bouquet’s crumble and the scream’s rawness make the cost visible. Harkin’s presence supplies status tension that shifts when he accepts the whittling lesson. Minor slip: “blank mask” leans label-adjacent but is quickly embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the scream reweights the remade hush from imposed silence to chosen quiet. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence vs. mechanical hum tightens until the scream breaks pattern. Cost is legible in the scattered petals and Harkin’s flicker of fear/hope. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbines, and bouquet function as micro-settings that constrain choice: turbines swallow sound, bouquet disintegrates under touch. Sensory selection is urgent—crumbling petals, splintered porch, mechanical mourning. Spatial choreography is clean; objects track across beats. Turbines charge the final image by absorbing the scream, reweighting their indifference.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry grief without lies—tightens when the bouquet’s failure to smell forces the scream. Escalation is accretive: each whittled curl, each turbine rotation adds pressure until the scream becomes inevitable. Cost is the bouquet’s destruction and the crack in Lena’s mask. No coincidence resolves; choice forecloses silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: preserved grief vs. living grief, silence vs. chosen quiet. Subtext in Harkin’s grunt and the rusted tin avoids statement. Final image of split bouquet and shared silence offers non-literal answer—grief shared is grief remade. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and character-bound: “slow, indifferent gods,” “mechanical mourning.” Syntax mirrors Lena’s restraint—short, controlled—until the scream’s run-on release. No head-hopping; Harkin’s interiority is inferred through gesture. Dialogue is minimal, subtextual, and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; “curls of wood falling like shed skin” is earned. Final third remains clean; no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-Mandate grief carried in a happiness tin and a bouquet that can’t smell. Turbines as indifferent gods reframe eco-backdrop into emotional pressure. Whittling as subversion of silence feels inevitable. Risk in quiet ending pays off via charged poise.</comment>
