<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's mechanical arm, razor tongue, and internal contradiction between yearning for answers and learning to wait land believably and drive each thrust of the duel-display-negotiation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The duel-as-overture premise is established early; every parry and coded sundial angle tightens options until the needle card and key yield an earned decisive change with visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass-mint brook light, gnomon shadow geometry, and the sundial’s hidden notch pressure choices; the half-painted numerals re-emerge reweighted at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate because each coded attack forecloses diplomatic options; the cost is legible in the sung metal sparks and the partner handshake that accepts unwritten treaty stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—turning questions into destinations—emerges through Elias’s final thrust into the dial center; non-literal, resonant reconfiguration, no tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Precision mechanical diction, kinetic under pressure, with free-indirect compression of Elias’s intransigent skepticism; no head-hop, voice distinct and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Crisp, density-rich sentences advance plot without padding; filter verbs minimal, carving unique sensory textures but occasional ornamental flourish in high-stakes beat pulls down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Philosophical duel reimagined as coded treaty negotiation breathes new life into familiar fencing tropes; specific geometries, charged needle-card reprise, and mechanical arm as irreplaceable edge.</comment>
