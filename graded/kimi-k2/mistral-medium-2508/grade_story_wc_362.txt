<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Attentive-mystic characterization is consistently rooted in embodied micro-choices (palm to frost, knees hit earth), interior contradiction clear in rejecting belief yet searching for echoes; renunciation earned and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pattern-taught lyrical digressions serve situational lens; causality intact with decisive change—driven prism hurl that reconfigures options and severs connection; closure image lands on page with visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Quartz arbor functions as micro-setting blocking retreat, frost-patterns double as physical obstacle and sensory text; specific tool constraint (glass prism vs crystal) pressures final choice, supports closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through agency—each reading deepens the cordoned-off options; exfoliating prism redefines cost; renunciation of proof is earned stasis with on-page emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Truth-as-lie theme emerges via object reflexivity; ending enacts non-literal reweighting without decree—the arbor’s chime is ambiguous moral, charged reconfiguration reverberates, not moralized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—silence measured in degrees, visceral diction—consistent under pressure; patterned elision taught early, paid off at closure without clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose high-density, syntax breathes with rhythm; zero loops, metaphors coherent and tightly aligned to POV lexicon; final prism image sharp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Non-obvious synthesis of haunt + object resonance; prism abnegation recharges quartz motif, risk without gimmick, ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
