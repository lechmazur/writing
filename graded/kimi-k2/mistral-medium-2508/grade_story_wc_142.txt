<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—order vs. anarchy—are dramatized in the moment she embeds the stolen chip into wet paint; the gesture crystallizes her renunciation of mainland order with visible cost (betrayal of past self). Interiority is embodied (“chest tightened,” “fingers twitched”) rather than labeled. The final micro-choice—picking up the can again—earns her Earned Stasis: she commits to fluid resistance, foreclosing a return to rigid grids.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural + embedded chip reweights Lumina’s future, making the developers’ grid less certain. Causal lens holds—every beat because/therefore tightens toward this act. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“raft city of Lumina floated”). Cost is legible in the chip’s guilt and the irreversible paint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft city’s swaying planks, kite lanterns, and frying-dough tang are filtered through Elira’s mainland-trained senses, constraining her balance and choices. The brass cuff and spray can function as micro-settings that guide tactical moves. Final image—paint on clocktower—uses the city’s kinetic geography to resist stasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Lumina’s fluid soul from gridlock—is signaled early and tightened when Elira embeds the chip: she trades her insider access for guerrilla cartography. One meaningful escalation: developers’ dawn arrival narrows options, forcing the mural-as-foundation gambit. Cost is the irreversible betrayal of her mainland identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: order vs. chaos reframed as bridge-building vs. wall-building. Subtext lives in the graffiti’s shifting lines and the chip’s silent accusation. Final image of vines-as-clockhands offers non-literal answer—time measured by resistance, not profit—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, kinetic, slightly fevered, matching Lumina’s carnival pulse. Compression (“paint hissed against the metal, bold and unafraid”) propels urgency. POV stays tight; no head-hop. Dialogue with Jax carries subtext (“Think they’ll get it?” / “We do.”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, tactical, and emotional data. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“city’s skin,” “stone burned like a guilty secret”) are precise and earned. Rhythm accelerates with stakes; final paragraph breathes into quiet resolve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gentrification fought not by protest but by cartographic graffiti that rewrites the city’s nervous system. The raft-city carnival is rendered with lived specificity, not postcard exoticism. Risky structural choice—ending on open continuation—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
