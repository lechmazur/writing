<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s “heuristically gentle” trait seeds every micro-choice—planting mint, pressing crumbs, handing the prince bread—so the final renunciation (silence, shared wheat) feels earned. Interiority is embodied and specific (“steam rising…like a memory she couldn’t place”). The only gap: the prince’s on-page interiority is absent, so the relationship crucible is inferred rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city stops adjusting, the bakery sign reappears, and the wheat field crystallizes the cost of noticing. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each loaf re-weights memory until the final image reconfigures civic memory. Cost is legible in the guards kneeling and the prince’s weeping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tea-house copper kettle, wheat stalks, and reversed river are vivid, selective, and directly constrain choice (kettle fires, wheat replaces fountain). Spatial choreography is clean; the courtyard’s evolution from skeletal trees to wheat field mirrors internal shift. One minor drift: “city” remains slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the city keep adjusting?”—is signaled early and tightened when Liora’s loaves force confrontation with memory. One decisive intensification: wheat erupts overnight, foreclosing denial. Cost is visible in the guards’ abandonment of posts and the prince’s muddy boots.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of tenuous absolution emerges through concrete acts: crumbs in soil, loaves on windowsills. Final image of shared wheat and unspoken weeping offers non-literal absolution without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (bread, wheat, vanished bakery) reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric compression—“flour once dusted the air like snow”—and perceptual signature (“she noticed when the ordinary tilted”) remain consistent. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Liora. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at climax (“He ate.”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“absence of answers could feel like absolution if you squint”—is minor and does not touch closure. High information density sustains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar magical-realist premise is transformed through specific sensory detail and civic memory. The wheat-field coup is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (reversed river, unlit kettle) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
