<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is precise—her “dry wit” surfaces in the phrasebook’s “ink stains on her cuffs”—and her final step onto the lake is earned by earlier micro-choices (touching the glass, dissolving the page). The only gap is a missing beat of explicit internal contradiction before she accepts the herald role; the cost is felt but not fully embodied in her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lake rewrites its own currents and Lena’s identity is repriced from editor to herald. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of condensation, phrasebook ink, ice crack—each layer tightening until the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and black-glass ice are not backdrop; the dock’s creak and the thinning center ice physically constrain Lena’s final step. The setting’s stillness is anticipation, not absence, and the condensation on the window becomes a micro-map that guides her north-by-northwest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to find where the rivers begin”—is signaled by the falcon’s page and escalates when the lake itself offers the answer. One decisive tightening: the ice invites rather than resists, forcing Lena to choose irreversible entry. Cost is the forfeiture of her prior life, legible in the paper’s dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the conflation of cartography and creation: maps do not record origins, they summon them. The final image—ink bleeding into water—offers a non-literal answer to the question of beginnings without moralizing. Subtext is carried by gesture: the falcon departs empty-clawed, the outpost exhales “relief.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is spare, exact, and wry—“her wit as dry as the ink stains on her cuffs”—with rhythmic control that accelerates into the final step. Perceptual signature is editorial: she reads condensation as deltas, vellum as rivers. No dialogue, yet the prose carries subtext in every observed detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances image or stakes; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“the ice sighed”—and never muddles causality. High information density: “the paper dissolved instantly, the ink bleeding into the lake in veins of black, rewriting the currents” performs three jobs in one line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—rivers begin where water remembers its own creation—is fresh, synthesized through Lena’s editorial vocation and the phrasebook’s dead tongue. Risky lyric compression pays off: the lake as archive, the editor as herald. Transformation test fails if names change; the concept is inseparable from this voice and place.</comment>
