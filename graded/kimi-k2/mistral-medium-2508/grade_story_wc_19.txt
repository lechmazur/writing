<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—the child's lungs shrinking inside sealed metal tastes of rust, their palms stitched with ember threads. Micro-choices under pressure (three breaths in, two out to limit exposure; biting the final vine) are legible and scale with stakes. The father’s empty silence motivates abandonment without sentimental justification. Earned stasis: the child's refusal to look back is visible cost at the word “sigh of rust and dust,” sealing the path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image—bunker collapsing, child biting the vine—delivers a charged poise: stakes, cost and new horizon legible without causal resolution. Sequence of gravity inversions intensifies density toward the last sprout. Cause-and-effect of each exposure is elliptical yet consistent; no unearned reversals. Orientation anchors early within ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Bunker’s curved ribs and the xenial trellis are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the ending “petals of steel peeling back.” Sensory compression—copper-tasting air, honey-lightning silence—tightens with urgency. Spatial choreography of ascent coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: freedom vs entombment. Each inversion tightens the live window—once every hour—until collapse is inevitable. Cost legible: child’s last sprout costs the father and bunker. Agency driven by cumulative choices, no deus ex machina.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of containment vs transcendence arises from metal folding back into sky—not a stated thesis. Silence reweighted from prison to portal. Final bite reconfigures premise without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression and breath-variation are taught early (three breaths in) and paid off (child bites vine). Metaphor engine consistent—silence flavored like frost, honey, copper. Focalization remains child-anchored, no leakage. Rhythm escalates with pressure: “petals of steel peeling” vs “lungs shrank.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops detected; information density high. Sentences advance atmosphere and motivation simultaneously. Metaphors precise—no contradictory vehicles. No register drift. Final line’s “taste of beginning” crystallizes without cliché.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity inversion as timed micro-cycles, silence treated as literal substance. Risk taken with lyric non-linear ascent succeeds because closure taught the pattern. Inevitable retrospectively—earlier silences foreshadow final bloom—making collapse and escape feel prefigured rather than gimmicked.</comment>
