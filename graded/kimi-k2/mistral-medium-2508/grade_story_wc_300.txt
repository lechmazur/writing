<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“fingers trembled,” “heart was full of names”), but motivation to “dissolve the walls” is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulses are shown mid-scene, so the final choice feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl dissolves into her, walls thin, and she walks away carrying cost. Causal chain (shells → confessions → pearl → dissolution) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Crystal caves and bioluminescent veins are vivid, selective, and constrain movement; the shells-as-confession device turns the micro-setting into a moral ledger that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—birth the radiance or keep the bunker sealed—is signaled early and tightens through each shell confession; the final act forecloses return to the bunker with felt cost (“pearl was gone”). Agency is present but abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of porous boundaries between self and world emerges organically from the shells’ confessions and the pearl’s dissolution; final image of sky “streaked with the same swirling light” reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in inspector’s perceptual signature (“breath fogging in the damp, electric air”); patterned elision (spiral phrases) is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with only minor template cadence (“She… She…” twice) and one mixed metaphor (“light spilled… like embroidery”) that does not cloud closure. High information ratio and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “found artifact” trope into a method of communal confession; synthesis of bunker, bioluminescence, and seashell spirals feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
