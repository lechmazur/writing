<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and consistent; the arrowhead against the sternum is a charged micro-choice repeated with rising urgency. Final “he was the stone” crystallizes a credible renunciation, but the self-as-tower beat is slightly abstract and could use one more physical cue to feel fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causality holds under Situational lens: the anomaly forces a crystallization of stance rather than a plot turn. Closure is Earned Stasis—he stays, becoming a still pulse. Cost arrives in the last third as “the Hollow Maw passed beneath him, its hunger unmet,” but it is off-stage, muting the punch of loss; 8.5 suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone tower acoustics and dust-light details are woven into every beat; the canyon’s echo is more than backdrop—it becomes antagonist, warning, and final silence. Object-level setting (arrowhead against sternum) also constrains the final tactic, satisfying micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear: keep the flock’s harmony intact without revealing the self. A single meaningful tightening: “movement was a confession.” Felt cost is hinted—stillness becomes the skimmer’s cage—but lacks a concrete forfeiture on-page to reach the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Theme is elegantly emergent: preservation through self-erasure, lineage as burden. The final silence reweights earlier hum without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit—nearly 8.0 but slightly shy of the deeper cost resonance required at the peak.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric, accumulative voice is taught early and paid off via pattern-echo (“the canyon…fell silent”). Some sentence cadences slide into mild cadence-repetition; still, the texture is controlled and singular. Interior diction and sensory filters fit the focalizer’s profession flawlessly.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Sensory density is high yet purposeful; figuratives like “wind slithered” and “wrong note threading” stay precise. One scaffold near 90 % mark re-phrases “stillness is survival” twice, costing 0.2. Otherwise no artifact or loop breaks closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ancient-listener lineage embedded in living stone myth feels fresh and avoids derivative templates. One fresh inflection: the listener literally becomes a stationary tower to defend a pulse. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
