<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s bitterness and sister-loss motive are vivid, embodied in tactile micro-choices (digging loam, pocketing arrowhead). The final metamorphosis is earned by prior refusal to heed warnings and escalating stakes. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: the herbalist’s status/power remains abstract, so relationship-as-crucible is only hinted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s laughter while being subsumed reweights the premise from tragedy to cosmic joke with undeniable cost. Causal chain (arrowhead → seed → garden swallowing) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored early; mosaic shards are legible. No teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Underground garden is rendered through scent, temperature, and gravitational tug; it actively constrains choices (vines coil ankles, loam hums). Micro-setting (arrowhead-seed) becomes the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One minor excess: “stars moved like schools of fish” is lovely but slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bitterness vs. cosmic assimilation—tightens once the arrowhead becomes seed. Agency: Elias chooses laughter/assimilation, foreclosing rescue of sister. Cost is visceral (body woven from roots). Pressure escalates via garden’s response and static phone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of bitterness transmuted into cosmic laughter emerges from concrete events (arrowhead, phone, vines) without moralizing. Final image reweights earlier motifs: joke is both horror and hope. Subtext in herbalist’s calm warning and Elias’s raw laugh. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic variation matching rising pressure. Perceptual signature is Elias’s bitter, sensory-driven noticing. No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“Some hungers aren’t meant to be fed”). One register drift: “cosmic joke” leans abstract mid-scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud musical. Metaphors are fresh (“static clinging to their skin”) and coherent. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Minor mixed metaphor: “gravitationally playful” slightly jars with later “misplaced planet” but resolves quickly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Folk-horror tropes (missing, garden, cryptid) are transformed through gravitational physics and cosmic humor. Specificity of thyme-scented loam and bioluminescent mushrooms grounds the uncanny. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet surprising. Risky lyric accumulation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
