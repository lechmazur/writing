<comment>Liora’s choices directly alter tactics: she shatters the lens, carves into bread, and triggers communal memory-rituals that reframe the city's future. Micro-choices under pressure (hands shaking while holding glass, repeated kneading) embody internal conflict and drive escalation. Earned Stasis in breaking the lens forecloses passive remembrance with visible cost: defying museum preservation rules and personal inertia.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the lens’s shards glow among initials, crystallizing a new solidarity under the waterfall’s song. Causal chain—lens shows displaced hands → lens broken → communal baking → hives reappear—tightens stakes without coincidence. Anticipatory exposition (“remember, remember” whisper) primes choice axis early; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Waterfall’s roar and lichen spray provide real constraints—stone walls force communal ovens indoors, mist alters what dough sees. The embassy-theatre of displacement carved into rock becomes backdrop that dictates social geography; later, combs the color of the lens emerge from cliff hives, charging final image. Specificity outweighs breadth; micro-setting (moldy crust vs. rising steam) grounds stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save displaced arts—narrows as each loaf initials raises cost: baker’s dough shrinks, Liora’s hands bleed carving stone-velvet 'K'. One decisive tightening: breaking lens redefines tactics from nostalgia to active enactment. Visible price—museum defied, beekeeper’s secret re-anchored—forecloses passive remembrance.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: displacement revealed as living city’s skeleton; rescue through baking lineage becomes metonym for communion. No tidy moral—the lens whisper is a lullaby, not ethic—yet resonance is non-literal and reweights premise. Final image of golden crust-named combs crystallizes meaning without concession to redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Museum guide interiority is concrete—“thaw” and “curved river” perception filter choices; no stock rumination. Rhythm accelerates under pressure: short declaratives during hive reveal echo kneading cadence. Distinct perceptual signature—greenburn ache in lens shards—packs final image with charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is concise and vivid—kneading butter-salt green ache (one sentence). Syntax mirrors rising dough; no loops or scaffold. High information density: “letters moved—twisting itself tighter” vectors tension through verb choice. Read-aloud ear holds rhythmic variety without purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Transforming displacement into communal ritual is fresh synthesis; beekeeper’s absorption crystallizes conceptual resonator. Baking initials for rescue feels inevitable yet non-obvious handwritten micro-history. Risk stance crystallizes stakes without gimmickry—no frozen-time monologue.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Present in setup, development, and closure: museal reverence weighs against kneading defiance while carving ‘K’ recharges ancestor fidelity. Causal pressure steady.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lens used twice: early revelation → broken shards that glow anew; emerald light of combs final reprise. Irreplaceable constraint shaping tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Displaced persons shape social territory (carved rock homes, baking cooperatives) and pressure communal identity. Visible cost throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Historically oriented trait constrains oven shaping—each loaf mimics ancestral curves, visible divergence from ‘tombstone’ stiffness. Fine integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>“Thaw” is literal thawing of honeycomb wax with lens glow and metaphorical thawing of memory; redefines high-comb honey retrieval tactics. Cannot swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Initial-bread custom seeded early, constrains oven timing, enables communal encodement, reweights ending. Specific mechanics and cost evident.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Waterfall mist provides real lubrication for hive relocation, shapes communal oven placement; micro-setting amplifies preparedness. Strong gate coverage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Clock of three winters missing beekeeper tightens urgency for winter honey; timeline tracked passively via combs’ color shift. One beat shy of full arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rescue desire manifests in micro-choices—breaking lens, naming into dough—altering parental trade-off. Credible friction between memory and action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rosewater dread colors early lens glow × later combs’ sharp salt, modulates from nostalgic sweetness to existential ache; final honey-echo crystallizes.</comment>
