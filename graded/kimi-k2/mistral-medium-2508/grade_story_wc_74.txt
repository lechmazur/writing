<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The painter’s insomnia and methodical hope are embodied in steady hands and micro-choices (dipping brush, pausing over glyph). Interior contradiction—exhaustion vs. hope—drives the final surrender to sleep. The gift-brush anchors motive and memory, but the calligrapher remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Cost is felt: the brush tip wears, the leaf vanishes, dawn must be rewritten.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each stroke thickens pattern until the final image reweights the premise—kindness remembered becomes breathable air. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the painter wakes to thinned smog and begins again, cost legible in the worn brush. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One transition (sleep) is allowed and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, fig tree, and moonlight are not backdrop but instruments: sap pulses under glyphs, moonlight writes on leaves, smog thins because the ritual completes. Micro-setting (leaf as page) constrains every choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—jasmine memory, lapis scent, child’s bell-laughter—guiding attention under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove kindness lingers. Pressure tightens once—leaf vanishes, brush wears, dawn must be re-inscribed—forcing a stance crystallization (continue writing). No external antagonist; the conflict is between exhaustion and hope, resolved by renunciation of sleep. Cost is visible: the painter forfeits rest and the original leaf.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: a dying leaf absorbs a dead language to resurrect kindness. Subtext lives in gesture—the brush’s worn tip, the vanished leaf, the opened window. Final image (“the word for dawn”) offers non-literal answer: memory is renewable ink. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unseen calligrapher and dreaming child.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, insomniac, precise: “moon-tipped brush,” “coin dropped into a wishing well.” Syntax lengthens with fatigue, then tightens at closure. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Perceptual signature—smell of jasmine, taste of green air—remains consistent. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; every image does double duty (“waxing moon slipped through the haze like a coin”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with fatigue—long sentences yield to the final spare line. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Clean grammar; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—writing lost languages on dying leaves to rekindle kindness—is fresh, non-obvious. Tropes (insomniac artist, magical object) are transformed through specificity: the leaf is not canvas but living tissue; the brush’s wear is the cost. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk in lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
