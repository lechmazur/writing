<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s hunger to shape the unseen is embodied in tactile pruning gestures and the seed’s pulse; the contradictory pull between keeping wonder and passing it through crystallizes in the final cut. The girl’s brief presence forces a choice that costs Elias his rooted life—an earned renunciation. Interiority stays specific and sensory; no diagnostic self-talk. Only the girl remains slightly generic, muting crucible intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s departure reweights the orchard’s rule-set and leaves a silver sapling as visible cost. Causal chain—seed → veil → girl → grafted color—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; the waterfall and parapet anchor time and place by line 3. One transition through the veil is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The moss-slick parapet and mist-laden apple boughs constrain every step; the waterfall’s breath literally veils the portal. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—juice thick as electricity, color too vivid for mortal eyes—mirroring Elias’s hunger. Micro-setting (the seed, pruning knife) charges the final image. No static catalog; each detail earns its place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens when Elias realizes the seed must leave his hands; the cost is exile. Agency drives escalation: each graft and cut foreshadows the final gift of color. One decisive turn at the veil narrows options irreversibly. Coincidence (girl’s appearance) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: wonder is not kept but passed through, leaving a debt. The silver sapling and impossible apple reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in silence and gesture—Elias sharpening his blade by firelight after the theft. Final image of children recognizing unnamed colors offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“calloused hands cradling a single heirloom seed—its shell veined with silver like a whispered secret.” Syntax modulates with urgency; short clauses under pressure, longer breaths in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elias’s perceptual hunger. Dialogue minimal, subtextual: “They fade here… Like us.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double work—“waterfall roared in quiet defiance” compresses sound and mood. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates through the veil crossing and breathes again on the parapet. Minor elevation in diction stays within Elias’s weathered lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The orchard-as-veil reframes portal fantasy through horticultural intimacy; grafting becomes literal world-weaving. Fresh synthesis: pruning as interdimensional surgery. Risky lyric compression pays off—the silver sapling and color-drained apples feel inevitable yet new. No stock tropes; even the “wise old gardener” is driven by hunger, not cliché.</comment>
