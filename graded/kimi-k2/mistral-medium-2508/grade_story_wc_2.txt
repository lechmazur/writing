<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tinkerer’s interior contradiction—fixing vs unmaking time—drives every micro-choice; embodied tremble, pocketed compass, greenhouse descent all spring from the same flaw. Renunciation of certainty at the end costs him all prior purpose, a credible earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative lens holds: pattern of broken things returning with altered meaning tightens steadily until final improvisational act renders “fixing” obsolete. Waterfall’s spoken ledger and spinning compass form a decisive resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Gear-odor of charnel earth, rusted iron greenhouse bones, black pool voice—each detail constrains movement and supplies symbolic resource. Subterranean waterfall as micro-setting pressures the final unmaking choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—befriend uncertainty—tightens through each broken artifact’s refusal to cooperate. Compass needle lock plus gear re-purposing force a decisive improvisation that forecloses repair with felt conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of broken-time-as-secret emerges through tangible objects (clock, compass, ledger) rather than abstraction. Final reweight—“beautiful precisely because it isn’t a plan”—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close-up mirrors tinkerer’s compulsive tactile noticing; syntax tightens and fragments under pressure. Distinct perceptual signature sustains from ash-smell through falling-water questions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose propels like the gears he pries: short bursts, then fluid water-fall sentences; no filler, no loop. Metaphorics (compass hum, leaves practicing) are concrete, purposeful, never purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle lies in reversing “fix the broken” to “befriend the broken.” Risky accumulative form pays off when improvisational unmaking feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative premises detected.</comment>
