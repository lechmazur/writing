<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s grief, resolve, and embodied memory are vivid; the bleeding fingers and heat-map burn show cost. Yet the interior contradiction—grief vs hope—never collides in a single beat; the shift from survivor to storm-player feels slightly telescoped rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the world “hummed… vibrating with the memory of sound.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat thickens texture until silence liquefies. Cost is visible in torn fingertips and the mentor’s absence. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The winterglass conservatory is both prison and instrument; its panes literally constrain sound and later sing. Micro-setting (piano frame, heat-map threads) constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—frost, salt, brass, blood—anchoring who/where early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens when the frozen air refuses the first note. Escalation is Accumulative: each attempt layers density until the storm itself is played. Cost is fingertip blood and mentor’s death; agency drives every shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: silence and music are “the same thing all along.” No moralizing; the final image of the storm “whispering” reweights the premise. Subtext lives in the heat-map’s silver scars and the piano’s shivering frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“raw, unshaken marvel”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors frozen stillness thawing. POV remains locked; perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic. No head-hop; diction stays within Liora’s salt-stung lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers texture or advances beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Winterglass,” “fractured gold of memory,” and “storm’s fury into the piano’s belly” are earned. Rhythm breathes with pressure spikes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit—playing a frozen storm into song—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of shipwreck and mentor relic are transformed through synesthetic alchemy. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure recharges every motif.</comment>
