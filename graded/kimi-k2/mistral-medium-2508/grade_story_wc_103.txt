<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liora's interior contradiction—designer bent on unbuilding—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing thorns, clenching the halo), and the final “build the edges” stance carries visible cost. Emotions are grounded in sensory detail and contradict cleanly (laughter as she gasps at being re-sewn into time). Motive is coherent yet the backstory flash reasserts itself three times with diminishing returns, dulling contradiction under the peak beat and capping full arc impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “garden sighing” and Liora stepping sideways reweights the premise (texture becomes something to survive, not solve). Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each compression of photographs tightens stakes until the halo’s unraveling restores the past’s grain. Cost is legible—“bones aching,” “ragged breath,” last grain felt under palm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The garden functions as micro-setting: hyperbolic geometry physically bends time, the bridge re-knots into a staircase, texture under palm constrains final step. Vivid selective cues (ozone-crushed lavender, silver sky) are filtered through Liora’s designer perception. Recurring living vines and bridge rewire themselves mid-scene, grounding closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrocognitive entrapment—signals clearly with the halo’s hum. Pressure escalates as photographs literally peel the past away; escape hinges on sideways traversal along geometry’s fault. One decisive reversal: hurling the halo unravels the loop and resews time at cost—garden groans, photographs refocus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory and time as tactile fabric rather than abstract line—emerges solely through concrete action: thorns under skin, motes on palm, edges to be built. Final image reweights the quest from discovering “texture” into enduring it without authorial didacticism. No tidy moral; the reader feels cost in residual ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence (pulsed vines, whispered secrets) controlled until the climax does not obscure clarity; POV stays close. Micro-compressions, while poetic, teach pattern through immediate tactile return. Non-standard spacing and italicized beats are pattern-taught and paid off during the walk through the photograph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with scene needs; syntactic variation propels the climb through spiral stair-that-is-not-a-stair. Occasional near-echoes (“photographs scream”) and micro-repetitions of “texture” nudge but clarity remains intact. Highest pressure beats avoid overwritten figurative clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Maze-as-living-texture and retrocognitive entrapment feel fresh and inevitable from scene constraints. Risk is high yet payoff lands with causal clarity. Echoes of garden-in-time narratives (e.g., Borges) are transformed through embodied sensory specificity. Final reprise where the bridge “gently sways as if holding breath” crystallizes unique perceptual signature.</comment>
