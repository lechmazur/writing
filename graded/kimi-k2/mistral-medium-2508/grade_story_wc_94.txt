<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulses—preserve vs. release the poem—are dramatized in the storm-drenched moment. Micro-choices (tearing the poem, resetting the timer) align with motive and carry visible cost. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing the path of possession. A hairline slip: the “cartographer” epiphany edges toward tidy summation, keeping it just under 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm edits the poem, Elias lets it go, and the blank page reweights all prior stakes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals—and the cost (loss of the poem, acceptance of blankness) is legible in the final image. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: the timer’s second chime is unmotivated, but it does not break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The observatory dome, storm, and rusted timer are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: the leaking glass literally dissolves the poem. Spatial choreography is coherent; bodies and objects track cleanly. The setting evolves with the storm’s pressure, charging the final image. Just shy of 9 because the dome itself does not undergo a final reweighting—the blank page does.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—release vs. preserve the censored poem—is signaled early and tightened once: the storm’s intrusion forces the decisive act. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency under Accumulative pressure; the cost (loss of the physical text) is visible. No coincidence resolves the conflict. The tightening is singular but sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete act of relinquishing the poem; no explicit moralizing. The final blank page offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how censored words survive. Subtext operates in gesture (palms upturned, poem pressed to glass). Complexity is embraced: the scars remain, but their map is now self-authored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—stormlight, ink, salt borders. Syntax modulates with pressure, accelerating during the tear, breathing in the final descent. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Elias. Patterned elision (e.g., “the storm edit”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally; no loops or scaffold. One near-purple phrase (“furiously tranquil”) is earned by context and repetition, not excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of censored poet, stormlit observatory, and dissolving poem feels inevitable and fresh. The vigil-in-pause concept is embodied rather than declared. Risk-taking (letting weather literally revise the text) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
