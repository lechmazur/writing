<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather and jellyfireflies anchor her contradictory impulses. The final hand-hold crystallizes her shift from isolation to tentative connection, with the cost of leaving the logbook behind. Kael’s scar and cautious grip add credible secondary pressure. Only the “landscape astrologer” label feels slightly ornamental rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared exhale and spiral of jellyfireflies reconfigure meaning without tidy resolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each luminous pulse layers density until the final image reweights belonging. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in Elara’s choice to stay below while Kael surfaces.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drowned facility is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered detail—salt-fogged lenses, groaning bones, dying emergency lights. The jellyfireflies and burnt feather function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. Environment actively shapes the respite’s timing and the lovers’ breath-cloud.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving belonging as frequency—is signaled early and tightened through the luminous respite countdown. Agency is renunciation: Elara stays, Kael leaves, both accepting the ocean’s cadence. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversals required. Cost is felt in the parting and the feather’s final placement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of belonging-as-frequency emerges organically from Elara’s mappings and the shared exhale. Subtext lives in gesture—the feather’s shadows, the careful hand-hold. Final image reframes home without moralizing. Complexity lingers: connection is possible yet transient, oceanic time indifferent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature—celestial scope, Morse-code jellyfish, brass eyepiece. Syntax modulates with emotional tide; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich (“holding onto something too tightly”). Compression is taught early and paid off in the spiral ascent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with the tide—long sentences for drift, fragments for pulse. Final line lands clean: “Some things didn’t need to be mapped to be understood.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise fuses drowned astrolabes, bioluminescent Morse, and tidal belonging into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes—post-apocalyptic lab, salvage diver—are transformed through sensory specificity and emotional stakes. Risky lyric compression heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. The ocean’s timekeeping feels newly discovered.</comment>
