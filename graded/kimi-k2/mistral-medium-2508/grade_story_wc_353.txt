<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s grief‐riven empathy drives every micro-choice—the porcelain insulator is pressed, the ear pressed, the cracks strummed—but the interiority drifts toward lyrical exposition; contradictory impulses (need to free the sculpture versus fear of reopening pain) show mainly in summary rather than in scene. His “tree-song” vocation constrains tactics well, yet the final renunciation (leaving the insulator behind) feels lightly earned because external pressure never truly tests an alternative course.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove keeps the song, Elias relinquishes the tool, and the siskins inherit the melody—cost appears in the insulator’s weeping glaze and trembling birdsong. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strum tightens emotional density until the release is inevitable; no causal break or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is visceral—damp needles, pale dawn, cracked oak—and constrains pacing, not mere backdrop. Micro-settings (insulator’s warmth against the hip, the hedgehog curled in undergrowth) press bodily intimacy. Geography is stable and spatial distances obeyed. The final image of birds perches on the sculpture’s arm and inherits the sound, using the grove as conductor, fully charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—give grief an audible voice in a mute world—is signaled early and deepened through each strum and crack analysis. Escalation comes as texture thickens: silence becomes waiting, then shared lament. Cost is felt in the insulator’s tear-glaze and Elias’s decision to abandon the relic rather than own it; agency drives climax though external stakes remain interior.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Empathy in motion is not stated but embodied; song becomes the vehicle for shared mourning. Sculpture’s grain, animal listeners, and weeping insulator form a chorus of particulars without thematic lecturing. The ending reframes world-silence as an ongoing exchange, charging earlier images of moisture and sap with conceptual cost.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The prose glimmers with rhythmic compression—“softest light,” “damp needle-bed,” “hollows of Elias’s ribs”—and maintains consistent lyric distance. Occasional density (“sorrow of the artist who’d shaped it after the last war”) leans summary, but voice never falters. POV modulation rises into the birdsong payoff without head hops or register drift.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level texture is lush yet precise; metaphors (wood “singing,” insulator “fevered brow”) stay purposeful. A few density bursts near 120–180 w risk overwriting but never impede cause or clarity. Rhythm accelerates and breathes with emotional beats; no scaffold loops or redundant stems undermine the closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>The quiet sound-sculptor trope risks familiarity, but freshness arrives via the crack-strum diagnostics, heat-retentive insulator, and hedgehog sentinel. No line echoes famous texts. The synthesis of ceramic tear and bird chorus feels particular rather than derivative.</question>
