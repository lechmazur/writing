<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—skepticism versus compulsion—are embodied in the valve wheel and the radio; his final renunciation of flight carries visible cost (“tucking the wheel into his coat”). Interiority is concrete, though the father’s confession is slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wheel exhales its secret, Elias’s stance crystallizes, and the ghost shift ends with felt cost (“lighter now”). Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp ribs, the beaded valve wheel, and the phantom loom constrain every choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the swallowed truth—tightens when the valve wheel’s weight and the phantom loom force Elias to confront Luz. Escalation is driven by his agency; cost is legible in the wheel’s exhalation and his dawning burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the image of swallowed thread and inherited guilt; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the radio’s static and the wheel’s weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, textured, and consistent; the psychic’s radio crack and the tunnel’s “sleeping beast” metaphor are character-specific. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“molared jaw,” “wet wool and burnt sugar”). No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-shift premise is transformed through tactile detail and inherited guilt; the valve wheel and phantom loom feel inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
