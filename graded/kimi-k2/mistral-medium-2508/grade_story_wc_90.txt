<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lien’s interiority is vivid—her grief, hope, and bodily lightness are embodied in every beat. The contradiction between clinging to memory and striving to birth a future is dramatized, not stated. Micro-choices (needle, breath, push) reveal a hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost as she steps through the tear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the locked dimension breathes, the ship remembers flight, Lien becomes first instead of last. Causal chain—tear → stitch → push → child’s laugh—tightens options until the tear splits open. Cost is legible in the photograph burning and the Eulogy’s dissolution. Lens holds as accumulative/textural pattern of grief-stitch-light culminates in irrevocable change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone-ship, black-glass needle, and photograph are micro-settings that constrain every action. Gravity flickers, hull creaks, console glows—all tactile and purposeful. The “other side” is sketched in three lines yet feels whole. Final image of green grass under singing stars reweights the entire recycled void that preceded it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension or remain the last—intensifies with each failed stitch. Agency is relentless: every snapped thread raises the cost of the next attempt. One decisive tightening when the tear resists forces Lien to risk total erasure. Price paid: 300 years, the ship, her own gravitational anchor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of mending the unmendable emerges through the concrete act of stitching absence. Subtext lives in the photograph’s warmth and the child’s impossible laugh—no moralizing required. Final reconfiguration reframes sorrow as generative: “something new began to grow.” Complexity preserved; no tidy redemption, only earned passage.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “ship of bones,” “thread spun thin,” “shadows lean in, hungry.” Syntax mirrors the act—long breath-like sentences, then abrupt cuts when the thread snaps. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Lien’s perception. Distinct texture sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density: every image performs multiple jobs (bone-ship = setting, metaphor, tomb). Rhythm accelerates with gravity flickers, breathes during floating pauses. Metaphors are coherent—“ladder of light” reprises the earlier silver thread. Final line lands clean: “She stayed.”</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic Buddhism, post-human elegy, and textile metaphysics. The locked dimension as mirror-universe womb feels inevitable yet unforeseen. Risky lyric compression pays off: 800 words contain a 300-year arc without summary drag. Specificity of black-glass needle and green grass anchors universals.</comment>
