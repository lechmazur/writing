<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias is textured through embodied detail (“breath fog… pulse steady”), contradictory desires (documentation vs. sabotage), and a credible renunciation: choosing art over futurity, paying with solitude and irreplaceable landscape. Motives build logically to the final click. The grain of sand moment cleaves change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a charged poise: the last untouched crater photographed, chemical beacon timed to survive drones. The causal ladder—hourglass grain seeds motive, beacon pre-empts machines, final shot immortalizes—holds under a Causal lens with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Moon dust grit, vaporing breath, and the summit’s knife-edge light are tactile constraints rather than backdrop. Earth’s swell against vacuum mirrors Elias’s swelling farewell; selective sensory detail recharges the closure imagery without ornamental clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Stakes tighten around preservation vs. industry; each glow from the canister forecloses negotiation and counts visible cost until closing shot. No reversals, yet the single escalation loop—dawn light + drone hum—crystallizes stance under coherent lunar pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The theme of “witness before extinction” emerges organically from choices and objects: grain marks time lost, beacon outlasters machines, final image memorializes absence. No sermonizing; the melancholy arises from specific embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The prose carries Elias’s regret: crisp lunar diction (“boots crunched”, “silvered dust”), rhythmic breath pauses mirroring vacuum hush. POV remains stable; interior thought (“Was I the last…”) is concrete and filtrered. No head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dense, propulsive lyricism without purple swell: compressed metaphors (“glow curled like a question mark”), muscular verbs, zero filt stalls. Silence feels knifed by syntax; no artifact in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Transmutes familiar “last sunset” motif through lunar specificity and bioluminescent clock of protest. Every detail—hourglass tear, timed gas flare—feels non–generic, inevitable by dawn.</comment>
