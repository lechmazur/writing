<comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—“her fingers twitched,” “the lagoon’s glow faded”—and the Renounced memory release is a visible, embodied choice with cost. Still, the contradictory impulses (want to heal vs want to purge) remain stated rather than dramatized mid-process; the sabotage hints never materialize in scene. The change is earned, but the character’s flaw never visibly risks failure.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the memory purge ends the clinical experiment, and the “lullaby” of the reeds shows a new stance with a felt price—“the doctors would never understand.” Accumulative/Textural lens is clear—each memory’s release increases the garden’s tonal density until the final quiet—cost lands in the line “her mind was her own” and the universe re-inhaling with her.</comment>

<comment>Micro-setting (lagoon, reeds) and macro-setting (universe inhaling) are integrated into every turn: Lira uses the water as a resonator, the crystalline reeds physically bend, the dawn sky reframes the garden. The sound wave garden is memorable yet remains a “resonator” device that constrains her exact rhythm rather than merely scenery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—freedom from stolen sorrow—escalates through a single beat sequence: sabotage hint → surrender → active release → aftermath. The pattern break (choosing release over sabotage) changes options under the Accumulative lens, forcing visible cost. No reversals are needed for this tight lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete mechanics—the theft and restitution of memory—never stated but embodied in every beat. The final image reframes “auroral sorrow” not as decoration but as released sorrow, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Quiet ending reweights prior material with inevitable conceptual and emotional cost.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, cohesive, and idiosyncratic—“crystalline reeds bending under the weight of frequencies no human ear could catch.” The rhythmic pattern (cascading fragments, long breaths) modulates under rising emotion. POV slips are nonexistent; sensory narrowing under pressure is controlled: “her breath came fast” aligns with drumming panic rather than external report.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Compression is high: sentences carry multiple roles (“Every memory she absorbed bled into the garden...”). A few lyrical excesses (“ghostly afterglow,” “shattered glass”) do not stall propulsion or cloud the final image at closure; one minor mixed-metaphor slip—“dissolved into the night”—cost is slight.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The “memory-releasing musical garden” premise is a fresh synthesis rather than stock template; memory-pond as resonant instrument feels inevitable once seeded. The risk of quiet lyric accumulation pays off with a resonant closure reconfiguration rather than action twist, demonstrating conceptual integrity.</comment>
