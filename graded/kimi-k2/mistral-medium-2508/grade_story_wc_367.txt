<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—duty vs. dread—are embodied in her tactile handling of the wick and the weaponized laughter; the final renunciation (“You can’t have it”) carries visible cost in the dwindling flame and her print-less descent. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only drag is a brief “she understood now” summary that edges toward epiphany-speak, blunting the full 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora forecloses the shadows’ demand at the cost of perpetual return, signaled by the lighthouse’s groan and her empty bootprints. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory pulse tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the bargain. One causal ellipsis (how the beam actually bars the silhouette) is minor and doesn’t rupture legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The emerald lighthouse, salt-worn stairs, and refracting glass constrain every move; the lantern’s curved glass becomes micro-setting that shapes the final tactic. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“smelling of ozone and old promises”). Only the village’s off-stage dreams feel generic, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—control the storm before it controls her—tightens through each pulse of the lantern; the final flare forecloses the shadows’ claim at visible cost (wick burns low, stars waver). Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals are needed at this length. The silhouette’s want is abstract, slightly muting visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ritual itself: dawn as negotiated memory, not guaranteed fact. The final image of “a thousand unprinted headlines” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext runs through gesture—the laughter that isn’t joy, the footprints that vanish—creating lingering ambiguity about progress and repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic compression (“storm wasn’t coming; it was already here”) and perceptual signature (“light that bent when you tried to name it”). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Occasional elevated diction (“prophetic”) is earned by mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“gears grinding like the teeth of time”). One mixed image—“drowning man reaching for the surface” applied to flame—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-as-orrery steering pre-dawn shadows feels inevitable yet fresh; the inversion of guidance (light traps, not reveals) reconfigures genre tropes. Specificity anchors the mythic: salt-worn stone, ozone, unprinted headlines. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reprise.</comment>
