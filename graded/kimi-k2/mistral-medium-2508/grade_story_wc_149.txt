<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—hunger vs. love, presence vs. dissolution—are embodied in every beat; the final renunciation (her veil unravelling into Vesper’s sapling ribs) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The keeper’s brief presence supplies status pressure without clutter. Only the keeper’s interior remains opaque, but she is secondary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s self-dissolution reweights the orchard’s rule-set and forecloses her return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cameo adds density until the bead’s crumble releases Vesper. Orientation is taught early by the wound-in-the-world image; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the bead’s dust and the dawn’s vanishing slash.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse’s glass, frost, and nightshade vines constrain every move; the bead buried beneath the oldest tree functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—rotting roses, silver-throated nightshade—filtered through Liora’s ghost-perception. Spatial choreography is clean; the keeper’s vial and Vesper’s sapling ribs track without drift. Environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repay the debt or lose Vesper forever—is signaled in the second paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each cameo drains Liora further, tightening options until the bead’s crumble is the only path. Agency remains hers; coincidence never rescues. The price—her permanent dissolution—is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the orchard’s poisoned fertility and the lovers’ toxic devotion; no moral is stated. The final image—Vesper half-skeleton, half-sapling—reweights the premise: love is both resurrection and consumption. Subtext lives in gesture (keeper’s wet eyes, Vesper tracing bark names). Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“smoke through a keyhole,” “petals crumbling”) is taught early and paid off at closure. POV remains stable in Liora’s ghost-perception; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich (“Again?” / “Almost.”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for breath, fragments for dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise and internally coherent (“bead burned like a swallowed star”). No register drift. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the orchard’s exhale, achieving Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The alchemical-orchard ghost-love synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh; the trope of lovers bound beyond death is transformed through specific botanical necromancy. Risk-taking (ghosting as excavation, bead as chisel) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration could not occur in any other setting or with any other object.</comment>
