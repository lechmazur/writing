<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacerating interiority—body-level ache, ribbon biting wrist—shows the cost of parental imperfection; the contradiction of love vs failed protection charges the final bite of the apple. Motivation arcs cleanly from duty-driven denial to willingness to relearn under pressure. Backstory is efficiently cued through prop and orchard without therapy-speak. Character emerges as individual rather than trope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal design holds: breach of contract seeds the quest for the root, seed-daughter’s note forces renunciation of old vow, ribbon reprise finalizes new stance. Closure is Earned Stasis—vow is not dissolved but reconfigured with cost marked by leaving the doll. No teleporting props; ribbon, seed, doll are conserved threads. Penalty −0.2 for faint orientation lag before ‘rib still arched’ clarifies place.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cathedral-orchard hybrid is lived in: marble cracks, sap-slow roots, edible apple. Setting does not merely paint, constrains choice—apple picked, earth dug, light-bend spot located at rose window. Some broad strokes drift toward lyric postcard; hence not 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Dominant stake is parental reconnection vs generational wisdom breach. One meaningful deepening when seed question forces a cost—asking daughter “What did you see?”—and option to keep old vow is foreclosed by eating the apple. Cost feels rather than declared; pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges unspoken: vows are living, can fall to regenerate. Final bite reweights earlier metaphor about leaves, reconfigures parent–child power flow. Resonates without sermonizing. One hairline slip from metaphor over-layering in “earth—and their daughter—had shown them how”.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical yet lucid voice with botanical, ecclesiastical diction that feels bespoke to mender’s craft world. Compression of time in orchard feels controlled and taught by context. Sentence rhythm mirrors breathing under strain. Dialogue memory feels era-matched despite lyric shimmer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density within 640 words; each image earns keep: “sap-slow heartbeat”, “roots … stitching wound to wound”. Near zero redundancy, zero filter verbs. Minor metaphor proximity—“smelled like forgiveness”—edges close to softness but works under stress. No paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Familial estrangement set in post-cathedral orchard is not new, but seed-note ritual and ribbon wrist-binding give fresh ritual texture. Daughter’s counter-wisdom via deciduous vow transforms cliché parent apology into generational role reversal. Specificity of props roots it in lived craft. Edge off perfection due to recognisable parent-daughter estrangement spine.</comment>
