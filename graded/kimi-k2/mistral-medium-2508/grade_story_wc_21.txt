<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—archivist vs medium—surfaces early and drives the climax; the renunciation of archiving for release is earned. Embodied emotion (pulse hammering, raw voice) grounds stakes. Yet the Revision Board officers remain functional silhouettes, muting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: dissolving the diary reweights “archive” into “release,” with felt cost (ink lost forever). Causal chain—letters → lagoon → parley → dissolution—holds cleanly. Orientation is immediate; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and floating zeppelin constrain choices (descent, retreat) and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent: salt-stung air, ozone, warm black water. Spatial choreography across dunes and lagoon remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs release truth—tightens when Elias must parley or flee. The micro-turn (choosing shells over flight) narrows options and triggers the Revision Board’s retreat. Cost is visible: ink dissolving, past unarchived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as burden vs liberation. Subtext in shell pattern and locket silence avoids moralizing. Final image of drifting pages offers resonant, non-literal answer without stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, yet precise: “brass hull groaning like an old man’s bones.” Perceptual signature—cataloging instinct versus visionary bleed—remains consistent. No head-hopping; POV distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. Occasional elevated diction (“retroactive fever dream”) risks register drift but stays within Elias’s scholarly lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: civil-rights archive meets coastal necromancy via retro-cognitive diary. Tropes (zeppelin, lagoon) are transformed through specific stakes. Risky dissolution of the MacGuffin pays off with conceptual repricing.</comment>
