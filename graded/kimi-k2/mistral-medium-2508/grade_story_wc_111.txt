<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vine dresser’s interiority is vivid—her tactile polishing of cracked marbles embodies both grief and defiance—but her final “smile” feels slightly abstract, lacking a contradictory impulse under pressure. The elders remain functional symbols rather than crucible characters, so relationship pressure is muted. The earned renunciation (letting the garden speak) carries cost, yet the emotional layering stops just short of contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polished marble layers pattern until the final image reframes “luck” as uncountable. Closure lands in the garden’s choice to mend glass with living vines—Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (elders’ ledgers stay closed). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The maze, marbles, and vines are filtered through the dresser’s biased attention; every sensory detail (cracks like “veins of silver”) constrains her ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the shrine hollow and western wall ivy track consistently. Environment subtly guides her tactic of non-argument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—garden’s unmeasurable value versus elders’ ledger logic—tightens once when she leads them to the marble shrine. The pressure deepens rather than reverses; the garden’s act of mending forecloses the elders’ quantifying stance with visible social cost (empty-handed return).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the immeasurable aliveness of relationship versus transactional control. Subtext lives in gesture—the elders’ boots “crushing delicate shoots” and their silent kneeling. Final image reframes “luck” without moralizing, though the elders’ overnight conversion edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile specificity (“withered hands steady”). Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural (“This wasn’t in the tally”). Free-indirect style remains coherent; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical—“shattered promises” risks purple but is earned by prior marble motif. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent; rhythm breathes at closure. Minor filter verbs (“she remembered”) are voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar “nature versus commerce” frame is transformed through the cracked-marble ritual and the garden’s active mending. Specificity of vine-training and marble veins feels fresh. The inversion—elders learning plant names—offers a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in quiet lyricism pays off.</comment>
