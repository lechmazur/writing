<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her skepticism and ache for her father collide in the amber fly’s pulse. The final choice to dissolve into the galaxy is earned by prior micro-choices (touching the terminal, whispering the memory). Cost is felt: she forfeits her old life and identity. Only minor slip: the father’s “crutch for the faithless” line edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward science and faith flips when she touches the galaxy. Causal chain—footprints → sculptures → terminal question → galaxy key—holds cleanly. Cost is explicit: “Most never come back.” Lens is Causal; each beat tightens options until only ascent remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower’s rain-slick stone, bronze door, and ozone air are selective and tactile. The sculptures’ impossible order and the galaxy hologram constrain Elara’s choice—she must step into the spiral. Micro-setting (amber fly as body-object) charges the final image when it dissolves into her veins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the universe is indifferent or homesick—escalates from invitation to irreversible departure. One decisive tightening: the terminal’s second question forces Elara to act. Cost is visible—her lab gathers dust, footprints remain. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: science as the language of faith, not its absence. Subtext lives in the sculptures’ weeping faces and the galaxy’s pulse. Final image—empty lab, wiped equation—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she lost or found?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “rain on bronze,” “stars not points of light but homes.” POV stays tight to Elara; no head-hop. Compression is taught early (“memory of rain”) and paid off in the final line. Dialogue is minimal but textured: “It’s your turn to leave the prints now.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “ivy half-swallowed the sculptures,” “amber fly dissolved into her palm.” No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and coherent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax, longer breaths in reflection. Minor filter verbs appear but do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—alien signal as pilgrimage key—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (ancient tower, cosmic invitation) are transformed through Elara’s scientific grief. The amber fly’s reprise as starlight is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
