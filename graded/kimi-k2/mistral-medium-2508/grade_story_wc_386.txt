<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the locket while guiding others to release—play out in embodied micro-choices (pressing palms to glass, tracing ice). The final renunciation of her mother’s accusation is earned by the widow’s catharsis and carries visible cost: Lena stays alone among the murmuring dead. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. One slip: “supposed to let go” edges toward label-speak but is immediately undercut by action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the widow leaves lighter, Lena remains in Earned Stasis with the locket’s jagged edge against her thumb—cost palpable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each candle flare, glass shimmer, and glacier groan layers density until the final silence reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; causality is by deepening, not reversal. No teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shrine’s ice, candles, and salt-scented air constrain every move; the glacier’s groan times the beats. Sensory selection narrows under grief’s urgency—fogged breath, fused glass—then widens to diesel and starlight. Micro-setting (altar, locket, globe) functions as extension of body. One minor drift: “blue veins pulsing” risks cliché but is saved by the glacier’s personification tying to buried time.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging what’s pure from wreckage—tightens when the widow’s grief is re-aimed from wrong ghost to living child. Agency is Lena’s deliberate exposure of the truth via the globe; cost is her continued solitude. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification, not external twists. No coincidence resolves; glacier’s laughter only underscores earned shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between salvage and release: the globe’s distorted image reframes loss into legacy without moralizing. Final image—Lena listening to silence—reweights the premise: some wrecks are people, not ships. Subtext lives in gesture (widow’s lighter steps, Lena’s thumb on jagged metal). No thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Lena’s attuned grief (“voices the color of old silver”). Compression is taught early (“the glacier breathed”) and paid off in the final sigh. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with candlelight. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: widow’s “That’s not him” carries layered hope.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Rhythm breathes with glacier time—long, slow cadences punctuated by sharp beats (“She lit another candle”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“seep through cracks”) fits the mythic register. Final line crackles without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost-whisperer as grief-midwife, glacier as breathing archive. Snow globe as memory lens feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No close echoes; transformation test passes—story fails if Lena is swapped for generic medium.</comment>
