<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—grief-driven retrieval vs. communal rescue—are embodied in the scale-patch on her wrist and the ink-drinking swatch; the final renunciation (staying to save others) costs her the ship and is foreshadowed by the garden’s “wild names.” Interiority is vivid, but the sister’s off-page erasure keeps relationship pressure abstract, capping the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden door opens, the ship sinks, and Liora’s new vocation is legible with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mirrored images and color threads tightens until the final cadence shift. One minor causality wobble: ledger page blanking feels slightly convenient, but the emerald’s ink-drinking teaches the rule early enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The derelict carnival ship is not backdrop; its warped mirrors and weeping carousel constrain tactics (ink transfer, mirror crossing) and charge the final image as it sinks. Sensory selection is urgent—salt, rust, black tears—filtered through Liora’s biased perception. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve sister vs. rescue all erased names—tightens once when Liora chooses the latter, foreclosing escape. Pressure grows via accumulative pattern: each mirrored face and crossed-out name increases the moral cost. The price (loss of the ship, indefinite guardianship) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-obligation emerges through concrete acts: ink transfer, mirror crossing, garden entry. No moralizing; the final image of emerald threads in a humming garden reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the carousel’s “black tears” and ledger’s “dried-rose ink” resonates without decoding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, with carnival-gothic diction (“carnival red and gold,” “black tears”) that stays within Liora’s perceptual range. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short gasps at reunion, longer lyrical cadence in garden passage. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work. Metaphors are coherent (ink as thirsty ghost, fog as door). One minor loop—“the ship groaned… the ship shuddered”—but momentum recovers immediately. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fuses drowned carnival, erased twins, and living narrative threads into a singular vision. The emerald swatch’s ink-drinking and mirror-garden mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
