<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“dust motes hung like suspended stars”), but the witness’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final renunciation (“simply, at last, forward”) is earned yet the cost feels diffuse rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: tearing the dictionary rewrites the collapsing library into blank possibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight meaning—but the causal hinge between “tearing” and “world rebirth” is more poetic than mechanically legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The temple-library’s warping corridors and bleeding architecture constrain every step; the dictionary’s warmth in final sunlight recharges the opening image. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, though spatial choreography is impressionistic rather than precise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusions”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when definitions liquefy and the library begins to die. The final choice to tear the dictionary forecloses the path of witness and arbitration with visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of language’s slipperiness and the cost of bearing final memory emerges through concrete events; the blank dictionary offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing—only the charged image of a world that “had forgotten how to ask questions.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, compressed, and lyrically consistent; perceptual signature (“wanderingly exact thing”) is maintained under pressure. Experimental elision is taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering is patterned and purposeful. Minor scaffold (“the temple breathed… the temple shuddered”) repeats without adding new pressure, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-library-as-dying-arbiter premise is fresh; familiar tropes of apocalypse and rebirth are transformed through linguistic metaphysics. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
