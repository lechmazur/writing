<comment>Interiority is sensuous and specific—the auburn-haired alchemist’s “hands trembled, not from fear, but from the weight of what she was about to lose” shows embodied, contradictory emotion with earned cost. Sentimentality is both declared (“secretly sentimental”) and demonstrated in the peach-sugar memory that must be surrendered. The micro-choice of tilting the crystal toward fire crystallizes value hierarchy—wonder held, not solved—with visible forfeiture.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blue fire in her veins and sealed glass door foreclose return while making next-phase stakes legible. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural—pattern accretion (starling cipher → crystal ignition → valley of glass) deepens the dominant stake in successive images. A single meaningful tightening sufficed: the orchard breathes its “last shred of girlhood” away, cost paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The orchard constrains: hidden enclosure, living roots that react to flame, and glass-tree valley replace it all pressure the final step. Dewless grass and mirrored water act as micro-setting objects that register transformation. Place anchors early; slight over-description in waterfall paragraph barely stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—signaled in “the way fire danced when fed by unseen winds.” Escalation is a single crescendo: fire swallows the older-than-light dew; tension does not plateau. No return possible after flame turns blue; exit cost etched physically into altered veins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges non-declaratively through image triangulation—starlings, dew crystal, blue flame—culminating in the “quiet truth that some things are meant to be held, not solved.” Avoids overt moralizing; final chord across earth’s bones provides resonant answer without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays internally coherent: “her mind already unraveling the patterns in the grain” aligns with POV knowledge. Lyrical diction (glass bells ringing backward) serves character’s heightened perception under transformation. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense without slack—sentences advance scene, emotion, or atmosphere. Minimal scaffolding; “petals unfurling in fast-forward, roots twisting upward” packs motion and consequence. Occasional run of compound modifiers (“kaleidoscopic waterfall shattered sunlight”) borders thickening but remains legible under accrued pressure.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar alchemy trope by pivoting from transmutation to renunciation—magic ends in refusal to vial the wonder. Starling cipher method is fresh, not decorative; crystal inversion (fire drinks older-than-light ice) feels inevitable in hindsight. No famous-scene echoes; specific synthesis feels organic.</comment>
