<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. need for absolution—are embodied in the micro-choice to uncork the vial while overriding the instinct to flee. The perfume’s scent coils “like smoke,” grounding her interiority in sensory contradiction. The final renunciation (not answering the signal) is earned by the hush’s cost: she now carries Elias’s voice “light as perfume.” Minor slip: “the marrow of her bones” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of silence and scent escalates until the hush reweights memory and guilt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the temple’s signal goes unanswered, Elias’s invitation becomes bearable memory, and the cost is the permanent scent-ghost she must “breathe deep.” Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The temple’s split dome and drifting jellyfish constrain movement and oxygen; the vial itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image when it holds only “clear water.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt, violets, silt under boots. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: harness the hush to rewrite guilt. Pressure tightens via oxygen countdown and dying signal; the decisive turn is uncorking the vial—agency that trades rescue for internal silence. Cost is explicit: she surfaces mute about the miracle and carries Elias’s voice as haunting perfume.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between remembering and surviving; the hush is not absolution but accommodation. Final image—wind-borne violets—offers non-literal answer: time is “something to hold, gently, then let go.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “the gathered hush” and “salt and crushed violets” create a perceptual signature. Compression taught early (“dying heartbeat”) and paid off in the last line’s refusal. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, memory, or pressure. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—perfume threads “like veins of light.” Minor elevation in diction (“ephemeral,” “relics”) fits the submerged temple register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater temple as memory vault, perfume as portable absolution, jellyfish as indifferent stars. Risky lyric mode commits fully; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes; the hush rewrites survivor-guilt trope into sensory haunting.</comment>
