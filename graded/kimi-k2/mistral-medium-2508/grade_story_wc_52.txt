<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The widow’s interiority is embodied in calloused palms, aching hands, and the refusal to weep; her micro-choice to keep the final carving instead of selling it crystallizes her arc. Motivation—learning to let go—drives every cut and is paid for in the ache of continuation. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“she was already half-gone”) that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each carving session layers density until the withheld lion on the sill reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—she sits with the next blank, cost felt in cold kettle and aching hands. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the circus-collapse dream is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the micro-turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is not backdrop; its fractured light paints stripes across the final lion, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (ash blank, knife, kettle) constrains every choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—damp cedar clings “like a second skin.” No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live beside absence—tightens when she withholds the last carving, trading market coin for private ritual. Escalation is accretive: each blank consumed, each lion released, until the final refusal forecloses the selling path. Cost is visible in cold tea and aching joints. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges from wood shavings and withheld carvings, never stated. The final image—lion glowing like embers—reweights “here and gone” without moralizing. Subtext in the girl’s question and the widow’s answer (“Because that’s how they are”) carries the conceptual cost. No thematic drift; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is spare, tactile, and widow-specific: “the knife biting into the blank as if resisting the violation of its wholeness.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences for memory, clipped for the climb. No POV leakage; diction stays within her lexicon. Dialogue with the girl is minimal but carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is selective—“steam curling into the shape of things she would never name.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold: “the cost of standing too close to wild things” edges toward aphorism, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The widow-as-artist grieving through carving is familiar, yet the specificity of circus widowhood and the withheld final lion transform the trope. The synthesis feels inevitable: loss → carving → letting go. No close echoes; risk is in quiet lyricism that pays off. Fresh inflection: the lions are always leaving, the carver always staying.</comment>
