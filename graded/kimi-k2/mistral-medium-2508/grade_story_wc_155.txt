<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her trembling hands, the warmth of the fragment, the smile at the end—but the “rediscover lost joy” motive is stated more than embodied; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene. Micro-choices (pressing film to fresco, stringing it between trees) align with motive and carry visible cost (the film will fade), earning the Earned Stasis closure. Still, the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density (discovery → development → display) until the final projection reconfigures the orchard’s meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the fog rolls back in but the ruin now “feels like a promise,” with the felt cost that the images will dissolve by morning. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard is rendered with tactile specificity—loam, skeletal silvered trees, fog that never lifts—and constrains every choice: the fruit is forbidden, the greenhouse light is “strange, liquid,” the projection must use the dead trees as anchors. Final image of fog thinning “just enough” recharges the setting itself as canvas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost communal joy—is signaled early and tightened once: the projection risks vanishing at dawn, forcing Liora to share it now. Agency is hers; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is legible—the film’s inevitable fade—though the escalation is a single intensification rather than a reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-restoration emerges organically from the orchard’s resurrection via light; no explicit moralizing. The final image of fog rolling back in while the orchard “feels like a promise” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“light slanted in strange, liquid ways,” “joy so bright it hurt”—with a consistent perceptual signature filtered through an artist’s synesthetic attention. No head-hopping; diction stays within Liora’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity (“scent of peaches filled the lungs”) replaces generic placeholders. Minor elevated diction (“crystallized,” “reconfigure”) fits the reflective close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of fresco archaeology, light-painting, and communal projection feels fresh and inevitable; the orchard’s ghostly resurrection via film-on-fog is a non-obvious image that grows from established rules. Risk in lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
