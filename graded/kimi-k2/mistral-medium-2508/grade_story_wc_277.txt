<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lydia’s contradictory impulses—inheritance loyalty vs. truth—are dramatized in the ledger beats; the final choice to run the story costs her father’s legacy and is earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete (ink-stained fingers, fogged dome) and avoids label-speak. The caretaker’s brief presence supplies status pressure that nudges her downstairs, satisfying on-page character crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore links—ledger line → plates → tomorrow’s edition. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: “The orbit breaks here” explicitly forecloses silence. Orientation anchors by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s acoustics and brass telescopes constrain Lydia’s hearing and movement; the echoing dome charges the final toast. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (sun too bright, zinc gleam). Micro-setting (rosewood pen nib) doubles as tool and keepsake, constraining the act of writing new questions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. family complicity—is signaled in the journalist’s call and escalates through ledger discovery and plate arrival. One tightening beat: “Final payment—V. Estate” collapses her denial. Cost is visible: she forfeits inherited silence to publish.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of regret as escapable orbit emerges from concrete objects (pen nib, plates) and choices rather than assertion. Final image of clinking teacups reweights the orbit metaphor into forward motion without moralizing. Subtext in the caretaker’s simple toast carries layered relief and grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—precise, slightly cool, journalistic—matching Lydia’s observant stance. Syntax tightens under pressure (“She dipped the nib once more…”). No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Dialogue fragment (“Says he’s got the ’98 printing plates”) carries subtext and urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“regret was an orbit”) are controlled and paid off. Rhythm modulates with stakes—longer cadence in reflection, staccato in discovery beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar inheritance-reckoning trope is refreshed through observatory micro-setting and proof-by-contradiction method. Specificity of zinc plates and rosewood nib grounds the premise. Risk lies in quiet resolution via teacup toast rather than courtroom drama; coherence remains intact.</comment>
