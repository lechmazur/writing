<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is drawn as a driven outlier whose contradictory loyalty to science and to K-11 crystallizes in the lever choice, but his private motive is restated more than dramatized. The cost is felt—he defies protocol and loses K-11—but his interiority tilts toward philosophical summary (“step through”) rather than raw, embodied regret. Voice-specific detail (“mechanically warm residue lingering”) rescues him from stereotype, yet overall the arc leans on thematic statement rather than intimate contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A coherent Accumulative/Textural lens opens with twilight murmur and accumulates pressure in repeating rhythmic beats: clock slippage, AI queries, specimen flickers, lever pulls, each layer charging the final image until Elias rests his hand on the quiet hum. The orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and closure meets the Resonant Reconfiguration bar when the lab rewrites itself into “a shore, a nest, [...] before a first flight” and then yields to “elsewhen.” The felt cost is visible but slightly understated; the moment edges rather than cuts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The skeletal frame groaning through pressure differentials, the holographic school-of-fish light, the aviary’s long-empty cages, and the viewport’s deepening bands are selective and tactile enough to constrain every move Elias makes—proximity, sound, threat. The final charged image of wings at rest inside the hush serves as micro-setting that crystallizes the entire station into a “nest.” One sustained atmospheric arc rather than a static backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving time flows sideways—drives every tweak of the magnetic field; tension thickens as the lab clock slows and K-11 unfurls into non-linear life. A single meaningful deepening occurs when Elias “tunes the instrument” and then faces the loss of K-11; option space narrows visibly. Coincidence never intervenes, but on-page cost is lighter than ideal for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Non-dual time unfolds organically: the station clock slowing like a held note, K-11’s timeline unzipping, Elias’s gesture becoming a sideways door. Theme is never narrated as a moral; it flickers only in concrete images and embodied choices. The hush of wings at rest offers a quiet, resonant reweighting—time as passage rather than measurement—though slightly undercut by the final abstract turn toward self-belief.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured by tactile specificity (“coveralls oil residue,” “husks of color”) and rhythmic control in pressure beats. POV stays within Elias’s sensorium—only what his fingers can feel or his ears can track makes the page free of head-hopping. One AI line crackles with iciness but shares Elias’s restrained phrasing, so no leakage occurs while distinct tension remains.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The prose is lean and sensor-forward; figurative language is selective enough to sparkle in peak beats (“held note released”). Information is double-stacked (holograms bleed into real = K-11 gone), and no loop or jargon clutters momentum. One minor template cadence with “mechanically warm” recurs twice rather than triple, so 9+ territory escapes within hair’s breadth.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of xenobiology and spatiotemporal dislocation feels fresh, driven by a mechanic’s intimate tool-work rather than heroic-scientist clichés. Wings replacing limbs and a clock drunk on time deliver a non-obvious crystallization that could only belong here. Risk-taking (quiet, anti-heroic closure) sharpens rather than obscures coherence.</comment>
