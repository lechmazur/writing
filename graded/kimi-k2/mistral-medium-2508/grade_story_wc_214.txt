<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s spiritual curiosity and patient solitude crystallize in the lantern-resonant climax; the decision to open to starlight is undergirded by thirty-seven years of embodied hush, so the renunciation feels earned. Minor slack: we never see Eli misjudge or falter in a visible-on-page beat, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens from first paragraph to last: star hesitates, pulses, heals glass, rewrites station veins; the final image of Eli walking forward bridges cosmos and earth, locking the before-after difference into a charged poise. Each beat layers stakes without causal loopholes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obs dome, cracked yellow lantern glass, and meteor-shower vibration are used to constrain choices (trace star, press palm, feel cracks); the starlight rewiring the station’s “ribs” gives the setting itself agency in the closing glow. Minor: physical anchoring could be 5-10 words clearer.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake “to listen in stillness” grows steadily; star’s hesitation marks a meaningful tightening that forecloses abandoning the station. Cost lands as Eli surrenders prior isolation (“fool” taunts now crystallize), though external risk is soft (alarms ignored but unstaged).</question>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of porous strength vs armored isolation emerges through the glass metaphor and star-breath climax; no overt thesising. Final lantern glow bridging cosmos and lone witness achieves resonant reconfiguration without sentimentality.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person interiority stays tightly focalized; rhythmic cadence mirrors Eli’s slow breath—“star streaked across the void,” “lantern’s light pulsed once”—compressing without drift. No head-hop, no register bleed.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical density serves atmosphere without overwriting; only a couple adjacent sentence stems (“the station hummed … the station’s walls now shimmered”) skirt echo loops. No clarity or propulsion loss at closure.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Cosmic janitor at end-of-service station waiting on star whisper is fresh; transformation from overlooked ghost to listening conduit is specific rather than trope. Only point off: the station as obsolete outpost is itself familiar sci-fi furniture, slightly muting boldness.</question>
