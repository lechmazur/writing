<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The interiority is embodied and specific ("her bare feet pressing into the frozen floor") and micro-choices under pressure ("she did not look back") pay off, but motivation tilts toward abstraction when her bodily “poetic restraint” is declared rather than dramatized in the climactic beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis: Liora’s renunciation of outside validation when the gates seal behind her locks a path with palpable cost. Causal drive is stable under Accumulative/Textural lens—because untangling, absorbing, walking away—but the mechanism by which individual threads equate to audible memories is never taught, weakening causality at a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific ("fell like shattered glass … cold stone … suspended ghosts of sound") and the prism sanctuary’s final light flares directly into the closure image. However, the courtyard’s physics remain vague, so environmental constraint on tactics never sharpens beyond a mood engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying conformity’s silence—launches clearly and escalates as each loosened thread tightens existential risk ("They will call you traitor"). A single deepening suffices for length, but the price is mostly atmospheric rather than a concrete loss Liora can no longer access.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme flows from specific action—untangling voices instead of hoarding them—without sermonizing. Late resonance when the snow melts beneath her tread retroactively reweights the opening image of frost and silence; a trace too much lyric abstraction in interior commentary nudges it from the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose’s rhythmic control is taut: “the snow melted where she stood” lands as crystallized Charged Poise. Occasional flourishes like “living poem of restraint” flirt with overwriting but remain consistent with Liora’s heightened sensorium; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences propel without scaffold; sensory details (“blades of color that cut through dusk”) compress multiple jobs. One stray stacked metaphor (“harvest of echoes trapped in glass”) slows, not halting, momentum, and it clears before the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The conceit of acoustic memories stored as literal threads is fresh and integrated with craft; reversal of the courtesan archetype into an acoustic liberator feels purposeful. A hairline deduction for prism sanctuaries being familiar magical-realist architecture, albeit reimagined with sonic ghosts.</comment>
