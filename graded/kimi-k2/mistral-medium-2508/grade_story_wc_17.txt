<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to map versus the need to remember—are embodied in micro-choices (pocketing the negative, burning the door). The final renunciation of mapping in favor of living is earned by the corridor’s pressure and the mural’s cost. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak. One slip: “the weight of legacy” is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open threshold reconfigures Elias’s stance with visible cost—the corridor now sings instead of whispers. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of remembered voices tightens until the mural crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Minor ellipsis around how the door fully burns away is forgiven under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, negatives, and mural act as micro-settings that constrain every move—ivy blocks paths, negatives demand alignment, mural forces completion. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“scent of old smoke and wet earth”). The final glowing threshold recharges the initial damp stone, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to map or to remember—tightens when the mural demands Elias sketch faces instead of lines. The cost is the irrevocable shift from observer to participant; the corridor’s song confirms the price. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Coincidence (mother’s eyes in negative) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges through concrete objects (negatives, diaries, mural) without authorial statement. The final image—open threshold glowing—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: some dreams must be lived, not archived. Subtext is carried in gesture (negatives “spilling like confessions”). No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: perceptual signature tuned to acoustic texture (“slow, forgotten heartbeat”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences in discovery, fragments at climax. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Compression (“the walls didn’t just dream. They remembered.”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. One minor loop: “the weight of legacy pressed down… heavier than the stone” borders paraphrase but is saved by immediate physical action (lighting the match). No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<comment>The corridor-echo cartographer premise is fresh; climate-drowned world is backdrop, not gimmick. Transformation test fails if names change, proving specificity. Risky lyric compression pays off in the glowing threshold. No derivative echoes; the synthesis of sound-mapping and memory feels inevitable.</comment>
