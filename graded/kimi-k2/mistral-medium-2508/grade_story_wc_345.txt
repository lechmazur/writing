<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory pull between wanting Kael to stay and knowing he might leave is dramatized in the final beat. Kael’s ghostly flicker-to-solid arc is consistent and character-specific. The collective effort is credibly earned through her micro-choices (ringing the bell, writing “We stay”). Minor slip: Kael’s death details remain abstract, blunting the cost of his presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula becomes a place to build, not escape, and the cost is the irrevocable commitment “We stay.” Causal chain holds—bell rings → arches listen → strangers gather → planet breathes back. One transition (weeks compressed) is clean. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating arches, starlit fruit, and chalked sidewalks are selective, sensory, and thematically charged. The watering bell reappears at closure, constraining the final choice. Micro-setting (cracks in soil) guides Liora’s listening and discovery. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn war-scarred planet into nebula of respite—is signaled early and tightened through collective labor. One meaningful escalation: ringing the bell shifts from personal ritual to cosmic response. Cost is visible in Liora’s chalked “We stay,” foreclosing departure. Pressure coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: respite is co-created, not granted. Subtext in Kael’s “Some ghosts are just family who forgot to leave” reframes haunting as belonging. Final image of the universe breathing back offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Liora’s perceptual bias (“ribs of a god the planet had swallowed”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; compression in “We stay” crystallizes stance. No head-hopping; POV stable. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“You’re early”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves theme (“bloom in reverse”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“nebula of respite”) fits the speculative frame. Final line earns cadence shift without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost as gardener, nebula as collective exhale, chalked sidewalks as communal scripture. Tropes transformed through grounded labor and specific detail. Risk in lyric compression pays off; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
