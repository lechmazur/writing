<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven obsession and methodical temperament are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing glyphs, climbing the branch). The final “reestablishing” moment crystallizes his arc with visible cost—he can visit but not stay—earning the shift. Interiority stays concrete; only the late “spirit as hypothesis” line edges toward label-speak, blunting the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world tilts “through” and Elias re-enters a living memory, paying the price of impermanence. Causal linkage holds—seed → invocation → transition—under an Accumulative/Textural lens where pattern density reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The inverted ironwood Arbor is not backdrop; its magnetic tug and weeping sap physically shape Elias’s tools and ritual. The final image of the branch swaying “though no wind touched it” recharges the setting as both portal and witness. Micro-detail (warm iron, glowing sap) is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding transition without rupture—tightens once: the seed’s planting forces a literal “bending” that costs Elias permanent exile from the new state. Escalation is single but decisive; agency drives the climb and invocation. Cost is legible in the final beat: he must leave the restored wife to translate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transition-as-translation emerges through concrete particulars: cuneiform, sap, seed, mirrored study. The ending reframes grief not as undoing but as reestablishing in a new light—an earned, non-moralizing resonance. No thematic echo in final paragraph; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, slightly archaic, and consistent with a lifelong translator’s perceptual signature (“shape of one truth in the negative space of another”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during ascent, longer reflective cadences in the study. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, tool, and emotion. Figurative language is spare and purposeful (“petals unfurling like pages”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter verb cluster (“he thought of his wife”) is brief and voice-motivated, not disruptive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inverted magnetic Arbor, cuneiform seed, and grief-translation conceit synthesize into a fresh emotional engine. Risky speculative elements serve the interior arc rather than ornament. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming familiar loss-recovery tropes through linguistic metaphysics.</comment>
