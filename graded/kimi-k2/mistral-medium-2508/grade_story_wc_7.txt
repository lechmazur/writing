<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories as flavor, pruning choices that reconfigure his stance—and the final renunciation (refusing to sell the fruit) is earned by prior beats. A hairline slip: “the knowledge fruit didn’t give answers. It gave context” edges toward label-speak mid-climax, blunting embodied contradiction by a notch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: seed → growth → tasting → decision to feed others. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he forecloses the path of fame with visible cost (“He wasn’t a chef anymore”). One micro-transition between night and dawn is legible; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains every move—vines, soil, cracked glass—and the final image of vines reclaiming iron beams recharges the opening decay. Micro-setting (seed, fruit pulp) doubles as tool and sacrament, directly shaping the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to exploit or share the fruit—tightens once when Elias slices it and chooses nourishment. Cost is felt: loss of professional identity and social standing. Agency drives the turn; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through concrete acts: feeding the homeless, pruning for growth, refusing critics. Final image (“Some rebellions… grow into something even the ruins couldn’t contain”) reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct gustatory-perceptual signature—“taste memories like the ghost of a meal”—persists under pressure. Compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold: “thick and warm as rising dough” slightly recycles the dough motif, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The memory-tasting chef + knowledge fruit + gentle rebellion synthesizes into a fresh, non-obvious fable. Specificity of synaptic pruning as gardening method transforms a familiar trope; risk-taking (quiet rebellion) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
