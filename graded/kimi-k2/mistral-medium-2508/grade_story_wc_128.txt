<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s shift from profit calculus to quiet partnership is embodied in the locket hand-off and the midnight pact; the librarian’s guarded warmth feels lived-in. Yet the “quiet work” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final envelope, keeping the interior contradiction from full pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: misdelivered locket → recognition → partnership offer → dawn plan. Closure lands with the correctly addressed envelope and the ledger imbalance as felt cost. The single transition (symphony end → midnight → dawn) is cleanly anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sea-salt breeze, lantern-lit courtyard, and the oleander’s scent are selective and POV-filtered. The library itself remains backdrop rather than constraint; the locket as micro-setting carries more weight, nudging this just past functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—tightens when Elias trades profit for covert charity. The cost (ledger imbalance) is named but lightly felt; escalation is single-turn yet coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of compassionate circulation emerges through objects (locket, oranges, envelopes) rather than exposition. Final image of “music in the spaces between notes” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s shrewd, slightly wry perceptual signature; diction (“cargo broker,” “ledger balanced a little less neatly”) remains consistent. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrases (“salt-kissed breeze”) flirt with purple but stay within POV’s romantic tilt. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The misdelivered-locket coincidence is transformed into a fresh catalyst for covert altruism; the “broker of kindness” angle feels non-generic. Risk level is moderate—familiar seaside-literary mood—but specificity of objects lifts it.</comment>
