<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is precise—his pulse betraying his rational mask—and his micro-choice to photograph the page before Callahan arrives crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (leaving the crate) carries visible cost and is rooted in prior causality. Minor slip: “emotionally rational” is asserted rather than fully embodied in the moment of torchlight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage (find crate → photograph → confront Callahan → exit). Closure is a decisive change—Elias forfeits possession but secures dissemination—felt in the pocketed photograph. Cost is legible in the final line: “silent, crumbling, and finally, honest.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station constrains movement and mirrors the slow suffocation of the lie; the rosebush’s last petal seeds the final image. Micro-setting (crate, oilcloth, torch beam) is tactile and choice-shaping. Environment does not merely decorate; it pressures the standoff and charges the exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth versus institutional protection—tightens once when Elias photographs the page, foreclosing secrecy. Escalation is causal: each action narrows options until the final renunciation. Cost is visible in the forfeited Codex and the looming police arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ledger’s particulars: transactional faith exposed through concrete payments and modern deeds. Final image of the empty station offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth survives in the photograph, not the relic. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “honest” dark.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Voice is scholarly yet sensorily acute—“lenses fogging,” “ghost engineer”—with controlled rhythm under pressure. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices mildew, gold leaf, radio crackle in character-specific hierarchy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“ivy strangled the iron bones”—and never muddies causality. Final cadence slows to crystallize the exit without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Familiar premise (hidden church ledger) is transformed through the railway-station crucible and the photograph-as-key twist. Specificity of the illuminated B and the rose petal reprise feels inevitable. Risk in the quiet exit pays off: no chase, just moral repositioning.</comment>
