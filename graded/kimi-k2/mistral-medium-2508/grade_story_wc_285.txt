<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coachman’s interiority is embodied (“pulse quickening,” “parchment burning”) and his micro-choice to cross is rooted in decade-long discipline; the girl’s gift of the needle crystallizes a cost, though the merchant remains a functional prop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the act of crossing reconfigures the coachman’s custodial role and passes the promise on. Causal linkage (two fog-lifts → gutters silent → cross) holds; cost is the girl’s self-exile and the needle’s transfer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog, ticking gutters, and the yarn needle function as micro-setting that constrains timing and choice; the river’s reflection vanishing is a tactile cue that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean and selective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recognizing the exact moment to cross—tightens through the fog-lift countdown; the gutters’ silence is a live clock that forces the decisive move. Cost is the girl’s departure and the coachman’s renewed vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme of custodial duty and cyclical guardianship emerges through the needle’s inheritance and the fog’s ritual logic; no moralizing, only the resonant image of the girl walking upstream into mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to the coachman’s perceptual signature; diction (“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”) is voice-consistent, rhythm modulates with tension, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful (“mist percolated upward in slow, spiraling sighs”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor elevated diction fits the coachman’s arcane vocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Fog-bound ferry ritual feels folkloric yet fresh; the palimpsest promise and needle-key transform familiar liminal tropes into a lived system. The girl’s self-offering is a non-obvious turn that reweights the premise.</comment>
