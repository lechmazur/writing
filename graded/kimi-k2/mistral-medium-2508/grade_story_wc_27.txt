<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s barefoot defiance and tactile curiosity anchor her; the opera-glasses-as-torch moment crystallizes her awkward certainty into action that rekindles others. Internal contradiction—yearning vs. fear of silence—drives her palm to the stone. The cost is communal: she trades isolation for the burden of reignition. One wing askew indeed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (dust, hum, flare) tightens the same stake—remember the fight. Closure is Charged Poise: the bay’s roar reconfigures silence into shared breath, cost legible in Lena’s raw laugh and the scout’s hollow face filling with hunger. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cracked concrete, rusted girders, and warm spiraled stone constrain every step and choice; the opera glasses refract setting into map. Micro-setting (bare feet on grit) and macro (abandoned bay) fuse to force Lena’s ignition gesture. Final lift-off shadow stretches across the same cracked concrete, charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: break the rebellion’s silence. Pressure accumulates via the hum’s rising volume and light flare, each beat narrowing the option to wait. Lena’s agency: press palm, pass glasses, shout—each act costs her solitary refuge and fuels collective hunger. No coincidence resolves; the stones merely remember.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: meaning is forged in mess, not victory. Subtext in the humming stones—memory as rebellion—never sermonizes. Final image of shared breath and defiant shadow reweights the lull from despair to promise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, and urgent—“barefoot and breathless,” “thunderous serenity.” Compression taught early (“margin of daylight”) and paid off in final shadow. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays rooted in Lena’s grit-under-toes awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose pulses with varied rhythm; sentences accelerate with the hum. Figurative language is selective—“war drum made of stars”—and never muddles causality. Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances image or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: vintage opera glasses + ancient stones + spaceport ruin = memory-tech rebellion ignition. Tropes transformed through Lena’s barefoot intimacy with derelict tech. Risky lyric density lands because closure remains legible and earned.</comment>
