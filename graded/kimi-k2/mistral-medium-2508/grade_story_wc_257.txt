<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s grief is embodied in wire and sleeplessness; her shift from lilies to cranes is a credible renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is specific—grief “coiled tight as wire”—and micro-choices (tracing stencil, folding cranes) reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile is earned because prior beats show her hands no longer ache. Minor slip: “teach withering to bloom” edges toward label-speak but is offset by the copper flower’s tactile irony.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s stance crystallizes when she opens the curtains and begins communal folding. Causal chain—mentor’s stencil → coordinates → copper flower → crane practice—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each object reweights grief into shared light. Cost is visible in the black feather and the winter-long line of cranes. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory’s cracked dome and moonlit alcove constrain choices—she must wedge cranes into cracks and telescope hollows. Brass telescopes and copper petals are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the “old silver” sky. Setting evolves: curtains once shroud grief, then open to possibility. Micro-setting (bench, stencil, box) functions as crucible for transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform private grief into communal light—tightens when she decides to leave the first crane; each subsequent placement narrows her isolation. Escalation is accumulative: twelve cranes, winter line, stranger’s hand. Cost is visible in the black feather and the itch of new roots under skin. No coincidence resolves; every turn is her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between “genuinely artificial” permanence and living growth. Subtext in the copper flower’s trembling petals and the stencil’s bleeding vines avoids moralizing. Final image—shadows of vines on the wall—offers non-literal answer: grief can be shaped to hold light. No thematic drift; every motif returns reweighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, lapidary, with controlled lyric compression—“constellations long dead by the time their light reached the earth.” Perceptual signature is jeweler’s: noticing glints, wire tension, trembling metal petals. Syntax modulates with grief’s weight—long sentences coil, short ones release. No POV leakage; interiority stays strictly Lena’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion—“grief coiled tight as the wire she twisted.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—compressed during folding, expansive at dawn. Clean mechanics; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—folding grief into cranes that carry coordinates—feels fresh yet inevitable. Mentor’s ironic “genuinely artificial” reframes permanence vs. ephemerality without didacticism. Specificity of jeweler’s tools and observatory relics prevents trope drift. Final communal folding is a non-obvious synthesis that grows from prior particulars.</comment>
