<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's interior contradictions—loyalty to her father's legacy versus fear of communal censure—stay embodied ('pulse stutter', 'chain coiled like promise'). The tremble-turn at climax crystallizes her stakes ("she laid the blueprint atop it") with earned cost; elders' nod renders her refusal irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Causal lens (tremble-letter reveals sluice system → choice forced on elders) holds cleanly. Closure as Decisive Change: blueprint + chain on table re-configures valley's future with felt cost shown in elders' shadows pooling like ink.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Amphitheater's breathing ribs, brass links worn smooth, and volcano exhale anchor spatially and emotionally. The 'cracked dome' light and chain warmth micro-ground all major choices; no setting waste.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmony vs domination—escalates through revelation that floodgates were deliberate compromise; one pivotal tightening: blueprint on table forecloses all other blueprints. Cost visible in elders' hesitating fingertips.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Emergent but potent: theme of engineered compassion refracted through folded letter geometry and chain's bridging/shackling duality. Final non-moral assertion ("know when to let it through") resonates from concrete particulars, not sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lush, compressed diction ("volcano groaned like a door settling") remains consistent to Liora's tool-centric perception. No head-hop, syntax reliably modulated under volcanic pressure. Chain's metallic glint threads motif from first to final line.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose drives via sensory-metallic verbs; no loops, metaphor density purposeful ("willow-branch y's"), no figurative clutter. High information density: chain's temperature and chain's history compressed in one sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Engineering ethos turned lyrical—subterranean sluices as encrypted mercy—offers fresh inflection to eco-moral dilemmas. Transformation test: story falls apart without floodgate-as-compassion conceit, not just prop swap.</comment>
