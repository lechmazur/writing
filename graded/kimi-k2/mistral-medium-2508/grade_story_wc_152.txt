<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s needle-stitch synesthesia and off-key humming gesture interior moves that re-embody emotion, but interiority lurches into the abstract (“constellations he could name”). Wallet-sized interior vs plot pivot balance nets mid-7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure swells from causal lattice: candle flame → encrypted note → new red thread → observatory dome shatter. Clear Charged Poise with visible cost—the observatory sacrifice reconfigures truth’s venue hence reverberates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bruised sky, astrolabe gears grinding, embroidered galaxies bleeding into mortar: setting constrains Elias’s choices (embroider to encode escape), then becomes an explosive broadcast mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Story tension leaps as the flame’s secret pattern forces Elias to stitch then shatter the dome; each beat tightens the noose and forecloses political safe space with felt cost at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of speech vs silence emerges via embroidered rebellion; ending re-weights starlight as forbidden truth, avoiding moral statement through image of burning sky-light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lush lyrical third-person lingers on calculation gears, synaesthetic stitching, off-key tune—rhythm sustains momentum without drift; some high-register diction (“celestial blue”) checks POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Lines read aloud crisply, preferring concrete embroidery, gears, flame-flicker. A fewPurple phrases (“like a bruise”) and loop analogy (“listening for unheard stories”) pull back from 9 solo scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Freshly merges genre embroidery with spy dissidence; turns the observatory into a transmitter of collective memory—an inventive synthesis with earned closure that avoids simplistic binary.</comment>
