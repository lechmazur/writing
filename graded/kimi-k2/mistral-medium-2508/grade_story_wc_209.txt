<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is embodied and specific—her stained fingers, the cold glass against her palm—but the final renunciation (“she didn’t paint it”) is slightly under-motivated; the causal bridge from understanding to renunciation could be one sentence sharper. Still, the contradiction between seeking answers and accepting silence is dramatized, and the cost of leaving is felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment she sees the centuries-old jasmine pressed in the glass reweights the entire premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each postcard, mural, and petal layers density until the final hush crystallizes. Cost is legible in her blank postcard and bare-footed exit into the dark.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral window, and night-blooming jasmine are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: the cold glass forces her palm back, the scent thickens the air until she stops painting. Micro-setting (the window as reliquary) charges the final image. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—tightens when the glass reveals preserved jasmine; the deepening is her realization that stillness, not darkness, is the trigger. Agency is renunciation rather than action; the cost is the abandonment of her mural and the leaving of the postcard. One clear escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as the medium of revelation. The jasmine, postcards, and glass accrue meaning without ever stating a moral. Final image—her breath ghosting against the dark—reweights the premise with conceptual cost: knowledge demands relinquishing pursuit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the hush it describes. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices pigment stains, the scent of jasmine, the cold seep of glass—details filtered through an artist’s bias. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“reliquary for the hush”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph maintains clarity and cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—flowers that bloom only in audible silence—is fresh, and the transformation of postcards into a lineage of witnesses feels inevitable. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but it pays off. No close echoes; specificity anchors the universal.</comment>
