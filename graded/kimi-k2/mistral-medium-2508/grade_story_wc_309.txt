<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Internal contradiction is sharp: Marlin’s candle vs the Conservatory’s “perfection by button.” The garden scene converts his earlier failure into deliberate refusal—cost enacted when he whispers “Louder.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive is Situational/Accumulative: every beat reweights “sacred ≠ automated.” The mist-walk reveal and candle’s final roar form a Resonant Reconfiguration—cost is the candle’s irreverent fire rejecting the city’s hollowness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Cold-to-summer spire, candle-glow in frostbloom—the setting acts as antagonist and sanctuary. Micro-objects (stub of wax, keystone) become literal pressure points in the final refusal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“can the mechanized world admit stubborn light?”—tightens from ascent to rejection. The candle’s roar pays the visible price of irreconcilable opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme coheres around sacred imperfection without sloganeering. Final image of merged candle/keystone light refuses tidy summary and leaves the city’s hollow hymn unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured yet propulsive: “stubborn, sacred glow,” “choir of disapproving mentors.” POV stays locked to Marlin’s perceptual signature; compression in the ascent is purposeful and taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose accelerates without excess: “light clung like a memory to things the world had forgotten.” No loops in the ascent nor in the candle’s final blaze to obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elevation of a “failed” mage into keeper of defiant imperfection feels non-derivative. The automation-as-poetry-hollow is a fresh inversion of the tech vs soul trope.</comment>
