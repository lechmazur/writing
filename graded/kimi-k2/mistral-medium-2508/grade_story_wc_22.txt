<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coachman’s interiority is embodied and consistent—his rough hands, salt-caked boots, and whispered dead tongue all reveal motive under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving without witnessing the bloom) is earned by prior beats: the empty pockets, the lamp-lit map, the sleepless dream of roots in rifles. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s future memory is charged with the coachman’s invisible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each seed-scatter beat thickens pattern until the final image of glowing water reweights the premise. No orientation drift; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jetty stones, tide-slick boots, and kelp uncurling all constrain movement and seed placement. The reef’s bleached graveyard and battlefield furrows evolve from backdrop to active fertility, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: wind-taste, salt-grit, bird-cry all filtered through the coachman’s weathered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with living green—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when pockets empty. One meaningful deepening: the shift from daylight scattering to tomorrow’s darkness-needing seeds narrows tactics. Cost is felt in the sleepless dream and the vanishing footprints, though not yet paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus renewal emerges through concrete acts: seed dust on stone, roots in rifle barrels. No moralizing; the final image of sweeter water reweights prior violence without statement. Subtext hums in the birds’ chatter and the coachman’s refusal to pray.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is weather-beaten, salt-raw, and lyrically compressed—“syllables curling from his throat like smoke from damp kindling.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: long cadences for dusk, clipped fragments for seed-splitting. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains the coachman’s squinting wind-carved gaze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image does double duty (“stones slick with twilight and the last gasps of the reef”). One mixed metaphor—“broken rib” jetty—barely grazes clarity. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph’s cadence shift to quiet retrospection is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-war healing trope is transformed through the coachman’s occupation-specific ritual: seed pods that hum like old shells, bird-calls as cartography. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the garden’s vengeance is both gentle and absolute. Risk in lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
