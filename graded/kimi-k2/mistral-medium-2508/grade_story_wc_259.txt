<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the historian’s contradictory impulses (hunger vs. fear of knowledge) are dramatized in the pagoda turn. The final renunciation—letting the prism dissolve—earns its cost through prior pattern-avoidance training. Minor slip: “steady, unpredictable heart” is a label rather than embodied contradiction, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pagoda’s dissolution reweights the premise that knowledge must be held. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (dust, saffron, bronze light) intensifies until the cadence shift of release. Cost is legible in the faded veil and vanished archive entrance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The archive’s dust, cracked dome, and bronze facets are not backdrop but active constraints: dust blinds, light fractures time, the pagoda’s hum guides the turn. Final image of vanished entrance recharges the setting as a breathing wound now sealed. One hairline slip: “atoms of nostalgia” edges toward abstraction without tactile anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—purify without repeating past failures—tightens when the pagoda’s scream forces the choice to unmake rather than decode. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; cost is the archive’s erasure and her relinquished innocence. No secondary pressure dilutes focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: purification equals relinquishment. The saffron veil’s fade and the pagoda’s light-cascade reweight earlier motifs without moralizing. Final line “she followed it” offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live after knowing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the historian’s sensory discipline. Rhythm modulates from slow amber sentences to the clipped release of “She closed her eyes.” No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off in the final breath-exhale image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual weight. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (dust as golden sheets, pagoda as held breath) are coherent and purposeful. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in “atoms of nostalgia”—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—lost archive, forbidden knowledge—are transformed through the specific method of unmaking and the saffron veil’s historicity. The synthesis of sensory lyricism with conceptual closure feels inevitable. Risk in the non-linear dissolution sequence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
