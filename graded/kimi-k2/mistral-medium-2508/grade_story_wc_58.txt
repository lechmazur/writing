<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers brushing earth, the thread pulsing like a heartbeat—but the princess remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is absent. The final renunciation (to keep the locket and thread for now) is earned by the preceding sensory communion with absence, and the cost is felt in the garden’s held breath. Flaws are hinted (his voyeuristic intimacy with grief) yet stay safely hedged, preventing full 8.8+ entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias pockets the locket, reconfiguring his commission from obituary to cartography of absence; the cost is the unspoken betrayal of the princess’s trust. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One minor slip: the “thread grew warm” beat edges toward magical convenience without prior pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden, bench, willow, and thread function as micro-setting that constrains movement and discovery; the locket’s burial spot is spatially coherent. Sensory selection (salt, damp earth, bruised sky) is filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. The environment does not merely mirror mood but enables the final find. Missing 9+ gate: no object or place actively forecloses a live option at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping the geography of healing—tightens when Elias shifts from chronicler to seeker, pocketing the locket. Pressure is textural: each sensory layer increases the ache of absence. Cost is conceptual (betrayal of commission) rather than visceral, keeping it just below 8.2. No external antagonist; coincidence (finding locket) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically from Elias’s tactile tracing of the thread and the smudged portrait. Final image—“the wind still moved through the trees, long after the last ship had sailed”—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in the princess’s “lonesome splendor” line reframes grief as aesthetic, complicating reader sympathy. One soft echo: “cartographer of the spaces” flirts with thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“thread coiled like a question,” “bruise of violet and ash”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices through synesthetic grief-work. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor,” “conceptual repricing”) is earned by the elegiac register. Elision of magical mechanics is taught early via the thread’s pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent and purposeful (“sails swallowing the horizon like a sigh”). One minor loop: “He would listen. He would write.” could be fused. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors tide, reinforcing closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—obituarist for the living mapping absence—is fresh and grounded in sensory detail. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional arc collapses. Risk in lyric compression pays off. Slight deduction for echo of familiar maritime-loss motif, though the thread/locket device reinvigorates it.</comment>
