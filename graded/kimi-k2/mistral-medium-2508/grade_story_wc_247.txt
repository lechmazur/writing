<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied signing and Liora’s camera-shield choice reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; the final “we remembered them back” renunciation carries visible cost in the camera’s new weight. Interiority stays concrete, but Liora’s charisma is more asserted than tested in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s silence is reweighted from absence to living song, cost felt in the heavier camera. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of silence-mapped-into-music tightens to final luminous wave-chord. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor, moonlight, and camera body constrain tactics: the water rises in color-chords only after Elias’s signing engages it. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean. Micro-setting (camera) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming forgotten songs—tightens once when the faceless singer appears; escalation is driven by Elias’s signing and Liora’s disruptive flash. Cost is legible in the camera’s altered weight. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through concrete particulars; the final image of the harbor humming “wide enough to hold them” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—silvered moon, thread of smoke—remains controlled under pressure; POV stays stable in Elias’s perceptual field. Dialogue is spare and subtextual. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene intensity; final cadence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: sign-language-as-sorcery, filmless camera as weaponized memory, moonlit harbor as resonant instrument. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure. Specificity anchors universals; no stock tropes.</comment>
