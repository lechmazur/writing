<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s rogue-scholar charm is vivid in gesture and speech, but interior contradiction is only sketched; the final “smiling, hands in dirt” stance crystallizes his values yet feels slightly unearned because earlier beats show more cleverness than struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the morning-glory loop signals “now” and Elias steps into chaos—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain from gourd-seed to city-wide bloom is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse humidity and crushed-mint scent anchor early; the public garden soil later constrains tactics (seed patterns must evade drones). Micro-setting (gourd rattle) charges the final image when Elias pockets the last seed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“guard the untaxable spark”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Auditors begin uprooting gardens. Agency is visible: Elias swaps dandelion for rosemary, then pockets the final seed, each choice narrowing options with felt risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of language-as-resistance emerges through plant-syntax, not exposition; final image of roots “doing the talking” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in humming a half-remembered tune carries quiet defiance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: “sterile glow of compliance” vs. “air thrummed with whispers” shows perceptual signature. Compression in “They’re watching the words now, so we’ll speak in roots” teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and sensory-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“earth whispering sedition”) stay coherent. Minor register drift toward the lyrical is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of taxable thought transformed into botanical code is fresh and fully committed; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of marigolds-for-meet, thyme-for-time makes the conceit inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
