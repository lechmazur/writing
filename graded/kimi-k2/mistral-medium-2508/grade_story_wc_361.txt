<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courier’s trembling fingers and lingering in villages reveal a believable interior contradiction—fear versus duty. His final kneeling to plant the seed crystallizes a credible renunciation of the mentor quest in favor of stewardship, with the cost of vanishing into the fade. The woman’s pressure forces a micro-choice: accept the hum or remain a passive seeker. Voice remains distinct, though the mentor’s backstory is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the courier becomes the new carrier of the hum, the bridge roots itself, and the mentor’s absence is reframed as extension. Causal chain holds—mentor’s instruction → pendant’s vibration → woman’s test → courier’s acceptance. The fade’s laughter confirms conceptual cost. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ridgeway’s crumbling edge and aurora’s pulse constrain every step; the bridge of living wood literally reshapes the terrain. Micro-setting (pendant, seed pods) doubles as tools that alter tactics. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—wind, glow, thrum—filtered through courier’s jittery bias. Final image of the seed sprouting into story recharges the entire setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carry the hum or lose the mentor forever—tightens when the woman crushes the seed and the bridge grows. One decisive turn: courier steps onto living wood, forfeiting personal reunion to become conduit. Cost is visible—he dissolves into the fade, voice merging with the chorus. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder as transitive energy emerges through action: mentor becomes vibration, courier becomes bridge, villagers will become notes. No explicit moralizing; final whisper “the hum was always here” reweights the quest without statement. Subtext in the woman’s dry laugh and the abyss’s laughter carries the cost of myth-making. Resonance lingers in the dragonfly’s damp wings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “pebbles skittering into the abyss” and “ridgeway’s glow seeped into his bones” show perceptual signature. Compression taught early—“memory dissolved into myth”—and paid off in the fade. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich: “You think wonder’s something you coax?” distills theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; “the abyss exhaled—a sound like a thousand wings” is precise. Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Final line “the hum was home” earns its quiet through prior accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is inverted: mentor does not return but diffuses into infrastructure. Dragonfly-wing tech, living bridges, and memory-as-myth feel specific to this world. Risky dissolve-into-myth ending lands because groundwork (mentor’s instruction, pendant’s hum) makes it inevitable. Fresh synthesis of courier folklore and ecological magic.</comment>
