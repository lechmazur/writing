<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s skepticism and affection are embodied in micro-choices—wiping palms, kissing the cat, pressing the sliver to her temple—rather than labels. The interior contradiction between fear and longing is active in every beat. The final renunciation (paint first, door later) carries a visible cost: the sliver dissolves into her skin, foreclosing innocence. Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the studio becomes a node, the door half-painted into existence, the cost the sliver’s irreversible fusion. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens until the final image reweights all prior static. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by the burnt-sugar smell and fried rigs within 120 words. The final heartbeat of the door is the felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The studio’s ozone, melted plastic, and breathing walls are selective, urgent, and filtered through Lena’s artist-eye. The muscovite sliver itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when it dissolves. Light-painted constellations and ultraviolet spirals are not decorative; they are the medium of closure. Only a hairline slip—one generic “city slept” line—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—see the pathways Mira walked—escalates through textured density: static shock → fried rigs → sliver pulse → walls breathing. One decisive tightening: the sliver’s warmth forces the choice to paint or follow. Cost is legible in the dissolved shard and the half-painted door. Agency remains Lena’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between skepticism and the need to believe because it matters. The final image—the door pulsing like a heartbeat—offers a non-literal answer: belief as an act of creation rather than surrender. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unnamed colors waiting outside. Willowglass hope is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and specific—“willowglass hope,” “colors have names now, and they’re all wrong.” Compression and elision (“the light remembered”) are taught early and paid off at closure. POV stays tight; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, syncopated beats during the shock, longer lyrical lines during the painting. One minor filter-verb cluster mid-story prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “fractally precise,” “veins of light pulsing in rhythms that made her teeth ache.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sentences do double duty—advancing plot while layering atmosphere. A single over-lyric phrase—“the dark was full of colors, waiting to be named”—skates close to purple but is earned by prior restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The telepathy-pill recall is transformed from sci-fi trope to metaphysical key; the muscovite sliver is never just a MacGuffin but a literal shard of altered perception. Risk-taking—light as living tissue, painting as portal—heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable: skeptic becomes reluctant creator of new belief. No derivative echoes.</comment>
