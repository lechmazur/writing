<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is embodied and contradictory—her scar “pulses” while plants whisper, grounding the telepathy in visceral cost. The micro-choice to write on her mother’s file crystallizes her renunciation of decoding scars, paying with the ache she finally allows. Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present stance via the pen stroke. Only a slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis (“displaced miracles”) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of plant voices, frozen sand, and tunneling stone layers until the final image reweights “wound as time vessel.” Closure is a Charged Poise—Liora’s stillness beside the emptied hourglass—whose cost is the unclosed ache she consents to carry. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, taught early and paid off. Minor orientation debt in the first 120 words is waived by closure payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tower’s damp stone, frost-laced window, and whispering ivy function as micro-setting that constrains her hearing and final stillness. Sensory selection is urgent—thirsty ivy, dust like snow—filtered through Liora’s biased perception. Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Only the courtyard remains slightly generic, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep decoding or carry wounds—is signaled early and tightens when the archive door opens. One meaningful deepening: writing on the file forecloses the path of endless interpretation with visible emotional cost. Pressure is situational, coherent, and lyrically intensified. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (files opening) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “wounds as memory vessels” emerges organically from scar, plants, and hourglass; never stated didactically. Final image of dawn holding its breath reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the fern’s slithering voice and the unspoken mother-loss. Only a hairline risk of thematic echo in “displaced miracle” phrase keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“stone skin still damp from the night’s slow weeping” teaches the pattern. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora reads coffee rings and scars with the same tactile attention. No POV leakage; interior monologue stays within plausible post-surgical disorientation. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax, longer breaths in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each image performs double duty (“hourglass bled cold” links time and wound). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. Occasional elevated diction (“unremarkable”) fits the archival frame. One mixed metaphor (“tunneling…by examining rings”) is minor and closure-safe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical telepathy and surgical memory creates a singular atmosphere. Transformation test fails if names or places change—ivy’s thirst and scar’s pulse are inseparable from this tower. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
