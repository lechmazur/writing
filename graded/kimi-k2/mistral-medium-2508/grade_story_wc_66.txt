<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s renunciation—leaving the alcove, quill dry—earns its cost through prior beats: the risk of execution, the girl’s arrival as living proof the dust is learning. Interiority stays embodied (“his breath caught,” “inkwell dry like a promise”). The single contradiction—copyist who now creates—drives every choice. Lira’s brief presence still pressures Elias to cede the voice to her, altering their shared state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias vanishes, the phrase multiplies in ash and salt, cost visible in the abandoned quill and blank sheets. Causal lens holds: because he broadcast, the girl came; therefore he relinquishes control. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One tightening beat—Lira speaks into the static—reconfigures the stakes from “I transmit” to “they carry.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ember alcove, radio dial, and harbor mist constrain every move: dial dimming siphons light into sound, mist presses against windows like eavesdropper. Micro-setting—the radio’s brass warmth—functions as charged object. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: damp paper scent, salt-stiff coat. Final image of ash-scrawled walls reweights the setting from refuge to seedbed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—voice versus silence—tightens when Lira arrives: Elias must choose personal safety or collective resurrection. Escalation is causal: each broadcast raises risk; the girl’s arrival proves the method works and forces the final surrender. Cost is tangible: he loses shelter, tool, identity. No coincidence resolves; the patrols find only aftermath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: stories survive not by preservation but by dispersal. Subtext in the girl’s salt-stiff coat and the dust’s shimmer carries the unsaid history of war. Final phrase scrawled city-wide offers a resonant, non-moral answer: “the wind carries what the mouth cannot hold.” No late sermonizing; the blank sheets speak louder than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise: “mist coiled… thick as regret,” “radio’s glow secretly luminous.” Syntax mirrors Elias’s careful transcription—measured, then accelerating as stakes rise. No head-hopping; Lira’s speech is filtered through Elias’s perception. Diction stays within copyist’s lexicon; no corporate register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: each image does double duty (radio glow = light and sound siphon). No loops or scaffold; sentences vary in length and rhythm. Figurative language is selective—ember, dust, salt—never crowding a beat. Final line lands clean: “the dust had learned how to wait. And how to listen.” Zero artifacts in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: banned music as insurgent code, dust as mnemonic archive. The premise feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in the lyric compression pays off—the blank sheets’ refrain carries more weight than any battle scene. No echo of familiar dystopias; the war remains unnamed, the Ministry faceless, keeping focus on the act of transmission.</comment>
