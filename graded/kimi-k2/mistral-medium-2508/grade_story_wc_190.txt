<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied in tactile micro-choices—adjusting the dial, dipping the spoon—that reveal his vocation as caretaker of silence. The passenger’s unspoken grief is rendered through posture and breath, not labels. The final nod and drift constitute an earned renunciation with visible cost: the terrace is lighter, the vial clear, Elias alone again. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the passenger’s departure reweights the terrace and vial, leaving Elias in Charged Poise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each refracted sound and crystal bloom layers density until the final hush. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric but legible. Cost is palpable in the emptied vial and the dock’s absorbing wood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prism terrace, storm glass, and canal function as micro-setting that constrains every action: the terrace fractures light to soften sound, the vial absorbs noise, the water receives footsteps. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The mirrored planes and murky fluid evolve with the emotional arc, charging the final image. No environmental element is generic or static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: teaching silence to carry what cannot be spoken. Pressure tightens once—passenger boards, silence must be shaped—then crystallizes in her release. Agency is Elias’s calibrated interventions; cost is the fresh vacancy after she leaves. No external reversals, but the internal deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as active balm, transit as healing stasis. Subtext lives in gloved hands, refracted profiles, the vial’s glow. The final image—terrace humming in hush—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is honored; grief is neither erased nor resolved, only borne differently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, precise, maritime-lyric: “calloused from rope and weather,” “vaulting hush.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with the gondola’s drift. POV stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and voice-consistent. The prose teaches its pattern early and sustains it to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes; no loops, no scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“storm glass vial like a secret,” “train tracks curved like old scars.” Rhythm modulates naturally; paragraph breaks mirror the rocking motion. Zero artifacts in peak beats; clarity and propulsion are flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit—gondola as sound-absorbing confessional—is fresh yet inevitable. Familiar tropes (silent ferryman, grieving passenger) are transfigured through the prism terrace and storm glass. Specificity of craft (brass dial, copper spoon) grounds the fantastical. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final hush.</comment>
