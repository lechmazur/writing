<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is vividly embodied—her distrust of "luminous" promises and her refusal to wait are shown through the grit she feels when the box hums—but her change of heart near “sidereal patience” appears more declared (“wasn’t waiting... was knowing when to push”) than dramatized by conflicting impulses on the page. The final decision carries felt cost only after the fact; the earlier skepticism feels sharper than the moment she commits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the accumulating memories stretch and snap, reweighting the stakes until the fountains weep light. The final image—city breathing, Liora leaving—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with unmistakable conceptual cost (memory liberation cannot be reversed). Causality stays consistent, though the leap from “press a box on a door” to “entire city altered” relies on poetic license rather than physical logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>“City of forgotten fountains” grounds locale and tone; concrete specifics (rusted water, green coins) serve the theme of memories gone stagnant. The Bone Fountain constrains the climax—door fused into stone, only the box fits—earning micro-setting credit. Atmosphere is evocative without overwriting, though spatial orientation flickers briefly inside the chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is introduced early, and pressure escalates when threads resist extraction, foreclosing non-violent options. The cost (memories tear free with audible city-wide aftermath) is visible, but the escalation is telescoped rather than progressively tightened; one decisive pull replaces incremental tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Theme of memory’s dual burden/gift emerges organically; subtextual image of coins oxidizing under old wishes subtly reframes “wishing” as trapping. Ambiguity is preserved—liberation is not framed as wholly redemptive—but the final breath-image edges close to symbolic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyric third-person POV channels Liora’s perceptual signature (“her own memories... sharp-edged things”) with rhythmic control. Vocabulary and metaphor remain disciplined. One micro drift: narrative clarity inside memory-vault briefly fuses omniscient description with Liora’s limited vision, but the cohesion recovers under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Sentence music carries subtle syncopation—long clauses collapse into shards (“Not water. Light.”) without stumbling loops. Occasional lush phrasing (“threads of color weaving... like spider silk”) edges decorative but is justified by moment. Minor echo: two uses of “clung” within three lines feels noticeable under close read but does not obscure movement.</comment>

<comment>Fusing migrating geese with sidereal patience to craft a city where wishes calcify into bones and memory becomes liquid light is a fresh synthesis. Geese departure acts as framing image revisited in closure. While the “memories as liquid” payoff is visible early, specificity of geese-to-fountain mythos gives it local originality.</comment>
