<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and compulsion to listen are embodied in the frayed hearing-aid and the choice to follow the dead’s whisper; the moment he kneels and sees his own child-self crystallizes a credible, costly shift from detached observer to implicated witness. Interiority is specific—his breath “shallow,” the glove “faded to gray”—but the final recognition (“his child”) arrives with minimal prior internal contradiction, blunting the full force of contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static thickens into apparition, the glove reappears charged, and the photograph reweights identity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance toward his work irrevocably altered—yet the felt cost (“the hearing aid dead”) is stated more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atrium, mist, bench, glove: each sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s tracer’s bias for pulses and interference. The glove’s texture and the dome’s fractured twilight constrain his reach and focus; the final dissolution of the atrium reconfigures the space into memory, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting forgotten voices—tightens when the mist threatens to erase the woman and child. One decisive intensification: touching the glove unleashes the collective scream, forcing Elias from passive listening to active witness. Cost is legible in the dead hearing aid and the irreversible knowledge of his own erased past.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness to the erased emerges organically from Elias’s occupation and the revenant plea “Remember us.” The ending’s reversal—he is the forgotten child—reweights the photograph without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to what it means to listen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, slightly clinical in its tracer diction (“flagging those at risk”), then lyrically porous under spectral pressure (“the mist screamed”). Syntax tightens in crisis; no head-hopping. The final whisper of his name sustains the hushed, haunted cadence to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “its wires frayed but warm” does double sensory duty. Occasional elevated phrasing (“twilight into jagged blues”) risks overwriting but remains within POV’s perceptual lens. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—ghost voices through a broken hearing aid—feels inevitable rather than gimmicky because the device’s literal function mirrors Elias’s metaphoric one. The twist that he is the erased child arises from the photograph’s smudge, not late rule-breaking. Specificity of occupation and object keeps the story from generic haunting templates.</comment>
