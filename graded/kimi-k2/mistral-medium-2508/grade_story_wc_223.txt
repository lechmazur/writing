<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority crackles with self-contradiction and felt flaw; each walking-spell step unbinds both her shame and the world’s rules, earning the quiet ascension and soft loss that close the piece. Her shift from performance-grief to historian-of-absence is embodied, cost paid by silence chosen at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal spine—pattern walks trigger the wings’ release, which deters the penumbra—is legible from first step to final hush; every escalation tightens via her micro-choices, and the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible price: the storyteller herself becomes the untold story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustic ghosts and dust lexicalize power; the missing pawns reappear as wings that re-weight the theme, making the setting actively constrict choice while charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Subtle pressure mounts toward a single, quiet stand: renouncing memory in favor of surrendering silence; the benevolent ruthlessness is the penumbra’s same trait, and choosing to feed it absence instead of stories forces the decisive note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>What endures when the storyteller is gone becomes the governing question; the answer—silence preserved—is delivered through earned image rather than thesis, reconfiguring prior motifs into charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinctive lyric cadence and tight focalization; each fractured fragment compresses yet remains POV-bound, culminating in a hush that resonates as spoken silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffold loops; high information density and rhythmic control; figurative language is selective, always  in service of embodied perception rather than ornament.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Gives familiar post-apocalyptic crisis a fresh angle: the historian who opts *in* to oblivion, supplying silence the penumbra cannot digest—an ingenious reversion of story purpose.</comment>
