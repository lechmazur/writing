<question>1</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Contradictory interior pulls appear (grief vs practiced cool, duty vs release) and are embodied; the final choice—to let the daughter’s final echo drown—is earned from a chain of refusals that visibly foreclose a path, exacting a personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density (rail-spike warmth, zig-zag stars, hollow mouth). Pattern-break escalates toward final Renunciation—‘he let go’—with closure cost (loss of remaining echo) legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and echo-laden soil are anchored early; the rail spike’s re-casting from weapon to grave to mute bell constrains tactics. Micro-setting fuses body with tool and charges final image without excess exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ending the goddess-possessed echo—signal clear; tightening occurs when the mouth speaks the daughter’s name, forcing stance crystallization. Stakes stay visceral, one key turn sufficient, cost paid in relinquishing echo.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges purely through image and action: the unbearable price of retaining memory. Final silence (‘this one, he let go’) reweights earlier lullaby and garden hum as Conceptual Repricing—grief cannot stay alive without harm.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression establishes a single perceptual signature—sensory and sonic texture unique to this fisherman. Pattern-taught diction (‘hummed like a plucked string’) is paid off in closing lullaby. No POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm and syntax propel momentum; image-to-knot ratio tight; no loops or scaffold. Sensual compression (“stems blackened where it touched”) adds density without overwriting. One or two sentences edge toward the lush but do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, astronomy, and sonic geomorphology; none of these pieces feel borrowed. The sleepwalking constellation as emotional barometer and sonic earth as reliquary create an inevitable but unexpected closure.</comment>
