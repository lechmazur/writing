<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is textured—frost traced like “script,” ash in the lungs—but her brother is a bloodline fact, not a relationship under pressure. The adaptive trait is asserted rather than seen in costly micro-choices, and renunciation of the ledger strip feels more symbol than wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: beats add density (charcoal smell, star fade) rather than causal chains. Ledger discovery is the tightening; letting it fall creates Resonant Reconfiguration—a crystallized pause with the canyon exhaling as felt cost. Orientation and closure meet the 8-band gate with minor slippage in brother causal thread.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frost patterns, charcoal grit, star-hollow canyon—material constraints shape every step and breath, not backdrop tourism. The canyon’s silent exhale at closure re-weights stakes; micro-setting succeeds with near-gate precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single escalating stake: “find what survived the fire vs. accept absence.” Ledger discovery tightens it; releasing the strip crystallizes renunciation with felt price. Stakes remain abstractly rendered, keeping score just below 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</comment><comment>Theme of purpose in broken glass/frost emerges from event, never sermon. The final image—truth “clearer when broken”—resonates but is nearly spelled aloud, muting full 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, frost-crisp, with consistent lyric compression. No POV leakage or scaffold; rhythm modulates seamlessly under pressure. Minor drift toward literary abstraction, yet stays within focalizer range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cleanskin rhythm and sonic variety, high density with few redundancies. One clause (“lighter than she’d been in years”) borders cliché but is offset. Zero line artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Scorched ledger + frost reading is fresh synthesis of grief cartography. Not revolutionary territory, but executed with specificity and without tropes. No derivative echo surfaces.</comment>
