<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory identity—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter—drives every micro-choice; the coin grafted to her coat embodies the tension between destruction and healing. Her embodied reaction to the boy’s wound and her whispered lore show interior conflict in action. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she accepts perpetual village suspicion as the price of compassion. One slip: “unyielding compassion” is named rather than dramatized mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s Charged Poise at the alarm—coin steady, thread unbroken—reweights her father’s legacy from curse to chosen vocation. Causal chain holds: coin → memory → wound binding → emblem of new creed. Orientation is swift; no lens drift. Minor ellipsis in time jump to night hearth is acceptable under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand are tactile, heat-memory anchors that constrain Liora’s ritual and later return as proof of remaking. Cloud migration mirrors cadence shifts. Coin-as-micro-setting qualifies when sewn into coat hem, charging final image. One missed beat: no sensory consequence when the boy’s blood darkens the thread.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compassion versus inherited fire—tightens when the boy’s cut forces Liora to test her ethos in public view. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal: wound → binding → emblem. Cost is the village’s perpetual doubt, felt in the closing run toward smoke. No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from embodied action: scars as songs, fire as warmth not ruin. Final image of the coin’s pulse against ribs reweights father’s luck into earned vocation. Subtext in the boy’s laughter and the lagoon’s lullaby avoids moralizing. One soft line—“compassion wasn’t the absence of fire”—leans toward statement, but context rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, salt-bitter, with rhythmic control: “kelp-drift peace,” “rough and crackling like dry kindling.” Perceptual signature is Liora’s firefighter precision fused with volcanic memory. No POV leakage; interior monologue stays character-bound. Dialogue brief but subtextual (“Will it leave a scar?”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motive. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent: “lagoon’s surface so still it held the sky like a mirror.” One minor register bump—“conceptual repricing” concept is handled via image, not jargon. Final cadence slows appropriately to lullaby.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter-as-daughter-of-arsonist is familiar, but grafting the father’s coin into her coat hem as living emblem transforms trope. Kelp-drift tone and volcanic memory create singular atmosphere. Risk in quiet closure pays off: no blaze faced, yet stance crystallizes with undeniable cost.</comment>
