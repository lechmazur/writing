<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession with buttons and time is embodied in tactile micro-choices—threading the needle, loosening the wax seal—that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the button on the well’s rim) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he accepts that the hourglass will turn backward and the cliffs may still fall. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness. Only the traveler’s single spoken line feels slightly expository, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: prophecy fragment → cataloging buttons → retrieving the ninth → realizing the prophecy is a choice → hourglass reverses. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the button left on the rim crystallizes that shared wisdom is about choosing which threads to pull. Cost is legible in the final image—“the cliffs stood steady. For now.” Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, canyon well, and fossilized resin are not backdrop but active constraints: the slick amber weeping makes the descent dangerous, the well’s iron taste guides the search, the warehouse’s hourglass is the literal heartbeat of the village. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The ninth button’s amber face staring up recharges the setting as micro-setting, capping the score just under 9 only because the wider village geography remains lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the hourglass from breaking and time from spilling—is signaled in the ledger entry “Consequence: the hourglass breaks.” Escalation tightens once: retrieving the ninth button forces Elias to choose between foretold ruin and rewriting fate. The cost is felt when he whispers “We do” and the sand flows backward. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: shared wisdom is not foreknowledge but the courage to reweave fate. The button, the whispered confession, and the reversed hourglass form a charged triad that reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—button on the well’s rim—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic drift or explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and compressed: “calloused from years of twisting glass,” “the jar’s echo slithered free.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during descent, longer cadences in reflection. No POV leakage or register drift. The lyric pattern (amber, buttons, echoes) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “fossilized resin that glowed faintly in the dark like trapped sunlight” does double duty as image and foreshadowing. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during the descent and breathes at the well. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he understood then”) is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—buttons as pivot points of fate, whispers preserved in amber—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of prophecy and time are transformed through Elias’s tactile craft. The final reversal (prophecy as choice, not warning) is earned and non-obvious. Specificity of the button carved from “blackened bone of a bird no one could name” anchors originality.</comment>
