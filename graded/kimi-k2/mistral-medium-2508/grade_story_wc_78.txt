<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leeward’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the mallet pulses “like a second heart,” grounding his restless drive. Contradictory impulses—fear vs thrill—co-exist in the same beats, and the final laugh carries earned cost: he surrenders control to the storm’s song. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (leaning into the sway, striking the orchard’s heart) reveal value hierarchy and foreclose retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky “laughed with him,” reconfiguring the storm from obstacle to collaborator. Causal chain—strike → cloud response → sea voice → final chord—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each note thickens texture and stakes. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Cost is legible in the mallet’s pulse and the orchard’s uncertain fate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: its roots, shells, and driftwood dictate what can be struck and when. Spatial choreography is exact—wave lap tilts the stage, shells wired to branches chime on cue. Blue hour’s indigo bleed and cloud fractals mirror internal stakes. Environment constrains every strike, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn the storm into rhythm—signaled early and tightened through each percussive beat. Escalation is accumulative: each sound thickens the sky’s response until the sea itself sings, narrowing Leeward’s options to collaboration or destruction. No external reversals needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is the orchard’s survival and Leeward’s relinquished mastery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the act: resistance transmuted into co-creation. No explicit moral; the final thunderous euphony reweights earlier struggle without statement. Motif of “sketching resonance” evolves from metaphor to literal map across the sky. Ambiguity lingers—will the orchard float or sink—inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature in synesthetic phrasing—“clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence in calm, clipped fragments as storm answers. No POV drift; knowledge stays character-bound. Experimental compression (“fractals within fractals”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent—“bruise-bloom” of sound, “pear tree too stubborn to die.” No loops or scaffold; even abstract notions like “restless euphony” are anchored in physical action. Final line crystallizes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—percussion as weather control—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh, synthesized through tactile orchard details and lived stakes. Tropes of storm-raising and prophet figures are transformed by the dub/reggae metaphor and floating grove. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Specificity of salt-stiffened mallet and glowing pears anchors universals.</comment>
