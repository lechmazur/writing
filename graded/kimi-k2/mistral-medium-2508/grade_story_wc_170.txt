<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interior contradiction—she trades in hope yet refuses her own reflection—drives every beat; the renunciation of the cracked mirror at the end is earned by the earlier vision of the empty terrace. Embodied emotion (“her fingers brushing the cool glass”) and micro-choice (letting the mirror slip) keep her specific. The borrowed heartbeat aches in the soldier’s ribs, a felt cost that scales to the word count. Only the client remains off-page, so relationship crucible is waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (rainbow bleed, lullaby notes, heartbeat thrum) intensifies until the final bell toll reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Liora’s empty-handed descent crystallizes the cost without tidy resolution. Orientation anchors (terrace, dusk, cathedral towers) arrive by line 4; no debt. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The prism parapet refracts both light and choice: its rainbow stains guide Liora’s eye to the next mirror and color the final fade-out. Rain-slick stone and spring air are filtered through her tactile priorities—cool glass, damp flagstones—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography holds as she moves from balustrade to steps. Environment constrains the ritual timing; the bells’ echo is the closing chord.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trading stolen heartbeats for fragile hope—tightens once: the soldier’s ache and the mother’s tears are the visible price. No reversals, but the cadence shift from luminous vision to vanishing mirrors narrows Liora’s future to “empty pockets.” Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates (the heartbeat could fail) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transaction itself: hope as theft, beauty as debt. The lullabies’ bent notes and the cracked mirror’s peeling silver reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image—terrace holding “the ghost of a song no one would remember”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: is Liora merciful or parasitic? Complexity is embraced, not balanced away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, its syntax mirroring Liora’s poised stillness: long breathy clauses for reverie, abrupt fragments under bell-strikes. Perceptual signature is precise—she notices refracted light, not city noise. No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned elision (the actual lullaby lyrics withheld) is taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image does double duty (“dying light into fractured rainbows” = literal + thematic). Rhythm accelerates with the bells, then exhales into the last line. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“prism parapet”) is justified by the lyric mode and taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The heartbeat-as-currency conceit feels inevitable yet fresh, braided with lullabies and light refraction into a singular vision. Transformation test fails if names change—the ritual specifics are irreplaceable. Risk is high (lyric accumulation, no dialogue), but coherence never wavers. The final vanishing act reconfigures the entire frame without gimmickry.</comment>
