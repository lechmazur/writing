<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s driftwood sculptor identity is vividly embodied in micro-choices—fingers, stone, carving—rather than exposition; flaws manifest in impulsive storm navigation and naive faith in the lantern slide. Interiority avoids label-speak, and the earned renunciation (leaving the carving) shows credible cost. Minor gap: the GPS failure’s impact on identity isn’t tied to any internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot tightens under an Accumulative/Textural lens: storm pressure, lantern slide layers, and archway each pile density until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality holds—slide reveals past hands → Elias carves new layer → path re-opens. Closure is Charged Poise, the cost a handprint for the unknown next. One micro-turn qualifies; no escalation breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Salt-crusted archway as micro-setting pressures every beat: wind tunnels through it, stones conduct the lantern light, cracks constrain where Elias places the driftwood. Sensory detail is selective—storm-salt smell, stone warmth—serving pressure rather than décor. The archway as loom charges the ending, making the setting indivisible from stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes pivot on leaving a visible human trace amid temporal erasure; the single tightening is Elias’s choice to carve instead of seeking immediate rescue. Cost: no GPS path, no buyer money, only an uncertain marker. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence (storm’s turning back) complicates but never resolves. Visible price on page is light but thematically scaled.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The theme of human mark-making against time’s erosion emerges through concrete action alone—carved hand, lantern ghosts, driftwood boat slipped into an editor’s pocket. No thematic echo or moralizing; the final gift is the non-literal answer that “we were here.” Ambiguity over survival is preserved with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—turbine-hum tone, granite-mouth wind, slide’s shimmering strata—remains under interior pressure. Non-standard punctuation minimal; the lyric cadence accelerates through compressed, imagistic phrasing, especially in the loom reveal. No POV leakage; every observation is filtered through Elias’s bodily focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold: no filler verbs, no paraphrase stacks. Every sentence carries dual duty—texture and propulsion. Metaphors (“ribcage of some ancient leviathan”) are precise, not crowded. Final line “the storm would come again. / It always did” crystallizes cadence and theme with minimal words.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis (driftwood sculptor + time-loomed archway) feels non-obvious and inevitable. Familiar storm-strand formula is transformed by lantern slide’s layered histories and the final handprint. Risk-taking is present but not groundbreaking; no genre subversion beyond elegant execution.</comment>
