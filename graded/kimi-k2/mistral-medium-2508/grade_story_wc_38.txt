<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction—yearning to decipher versus readiness to relinquish—surfaces in the dice roll and the final dance, each micro-choice (palm on console, upward kick) carrying visible cost; the shift from theft to release is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lab floods, journals dissolve, and Lira rises—an earned stasis where “nothing worth keeping” becomes the new code. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each layer (dice, dance, water) reweights the stake without causal contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken lab’s green glow, creaking metal, and rising water constrain every move; the dice and shattered vial function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or drown the past—tightens once: the dice sequence triggers the failsafe, forcing the dance-password. Escalation is textural (water rising, lights flickering) yet agency remains Lira’s; cost is the lab’s loss and her bodily risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: encryption as fear, liberation as creation. The final image—ink tracing dice patterns on skin—reweights the motif without moralizing, offering quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to pressure and salt. Rhythm modulates from hushed underwater cadence to the percussive clatter of dice and groan of metal; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“water pressed like a held breath”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance atmosphere and choice simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—drowning as decryption, dance as code—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image without gimmickry.</comment>
