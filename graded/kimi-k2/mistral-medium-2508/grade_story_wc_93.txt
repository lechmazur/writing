<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is vivid—her curse, her tactile grief, her bleeding fingers—but the final renunciation (“she was just the one cursed to keep it”) is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the eels’ return re-weights the promise and Liora’s stance crystallizes into endless vigilance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density and cadence shift tighten the stake with visible cost in the burning dust and shattered mirror-water.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and star dust are not backdrop but instruments: the dust bites her skin, the frictionless tide forms a mirror that unravels her, the aurora snaps into a ring. Environment constrains every choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise or be unmade—tightens once when the dust burns and the eels coil; agency is renunciation/acceptance of eternal guardianship. Cost is legible in her bleeding palms and the dawn’s impossible colors.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of inherited obligation versus self-erasure emerges through the eels’ star-etched spirals and the dust’s memory; no moralizing, only the charged image of Liora walking the bluff “the only friction left.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“the tide had stolen the friction from the world”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off. Minor scaffold in “the rocks trembled… the water began to rise” but momentum never stalls; final image crystallizes without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic ecology and quantum memory; eels as living constellations, dust as time’s residue. Risky lyric structure stays legible and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
