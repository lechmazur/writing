<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—collecting silence vs. releasing it—are dramatized in the valve-toss; the ledger’s weight and the valve’s warmth embody cost. Interiority is specific (“salt-crusted edges,” “ghost of a note, not sounded, but navigated”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation (handing the valve to the child) forecloses his role as sole keeper, with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each fragment added to the ledger increases the density of memory until the final wind-turned pages reconfigure the city’s stance from silence to readiness. Closure is a Charged Poise—the valve passed, the absence held—cost is the relinquishing of control. No orientation debt; causality of collection-to-release is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivory harbor’s post-rain sheen and the lighthouse hut’s ink-and-damp smell are filtered through Elias’s archivist priorities; the valve’s brass warmth constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean from dock to roof. Weather and salt residue subtly mirror internal corrosion and renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring the city’s voice vs. accepting its silences. Pressure tightens when the restored council’s horn demands a response; Elias’s refusal to proclaim and instead pass the valve narrows options with felt cost. Escalation is one deepening, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening to absence emerges from concrete acts—collecting fragments, pressing valve to ear, releasing it—never stated. Final image of the child holding the valve reweights prior silences as potential rather than lack. Resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ocean-spray archivist’s noticing (“salt-crusted edges,” “faded graffiti”) and rhythmic control (“ledger lighter, his steps sure”). No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Compression in final paragraph is taught by earlier lyrical cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet lean; figurative language (“spines of forgotten books,” “ghost of a note”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. Minor elevated diction (“syncopated”) fits the archivist’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: the herald’s trumpet valve repurposed as a vessel of silence rather than sound. Specificity of ivory harbor, salt archives, and reactive vision transforms familiar exile-return arc. Risk in quiet ending pays off with earned resonance.</comment>
