<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured—dusty fingers, pulse quickening—but her decisive act (opening the locket and mailbox) is more ritual than crucible; the cost is communal catharsis rather than personal loss, so the renunciation feels gentle, not searing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard’s collective stance toward loss shifts when the mailbox yields its letter. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object layers resonance until the final image reweights “listening” as communal healing—yet the causal chain is soft, coincidence allowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vivid—jasmine, cracked tiles, radio static—but it functions more as atmospheric chorus than constraint; only the mailbox’s rusted jaw actively shapes the final choice, nudging the score just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s unheard voice—tightens once when the letter appears; the courtyard’s collective gasp crystallizes the cost of decades of silence. Agency is shared, not Mira’s alone, so the pressure feels diffused yet still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges through objects and communal ritual rather than statement; the final image of the mailbox filling with replies offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the question of how stories mend.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, tactile, and consistent—dusty fingers, “tick-tick like a heartbeat”—with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping, and the slight register lift suits the fable-like tone without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional soft-focus phrases (“the air smelled of jasmine and damp earth”) verge on postcard but never stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The locked-mailbox mystery is familiar, yet the communal epistolary aftermath and the locket-as-metronome give it fresh emotional geometry; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
