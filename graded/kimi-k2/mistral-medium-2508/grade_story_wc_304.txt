<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s dual vocation grounds every beat; the chip-touch at temple is a micro-choice that visibly costs her calm. Interiority stays embodied—her ribs “curl” the dead woman’s message, not her thoughts. Motivation (carry the spark) intensifies through the mirror-door scene, culminating in earned renunciation of fear. No contradictory impulses on page, but the flaw/competence balance tilts toward serene mastery, muting struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final smile crystallizes a before/after shift from countdown to rhythm. Causal chain—chip → static reading → doorway → message—holds without gaps. Aurora bridge supplies felt cost: the chip’s light is spent. Orientation is swift; “skyborne grotto” anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Skyborne grotto and aurora are not backdrop; the stone ridge and static veil physically enable the doorway. Micro-setting (petrified mist ridge) guides her kneel and chip placement. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and breath over visual catalog. Final aurora exhale recharges the opening image, constraining her stance of acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—tightens when the doorway offers exchange instead of escape. One meaningful deepening: mirror reveals the cost is bearing witness, not rescue. Agency is decision to reach through; price is chip’s spent light. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens as static density increases.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: thresholds are breaths between notes. Subtext in the woman’s outstretched hands—offering, not pleading—reconfigures death from void to continuity. Final smile answers the whisper without moralizing. Recurring aurora motif shifts from static noise to bridge, charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, yet disciplined: “petrified mist,” “bones of forgotten winds” stay within Liora’s perceptual reach. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for awe, fragments for the whisper. No head-hopping; POV remains interior and consistent. Compression (“it wasn’t light but something older”) teaches pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (“static wasn’t random; it was a language”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—aurora as exhale, chip as key. Occasional elevated diction (“thresholds…breaths held between two notes”) is earned by prior lyric pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of beautician-mortician with sky-morgatory is fresh; the premise reframes death-care as auroral midwifery. Transformation test fails if names change—specificity is integral. Risk in lyric world-building pays off; no gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
