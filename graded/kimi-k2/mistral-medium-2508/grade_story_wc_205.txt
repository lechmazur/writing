<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Elias’s contradictory hunger for revision is rooted in lived failure—his need to re-imagine the Republic gives interior urgency and emotional cost. Flaws (poetic idealism versus actual sabotage) drive the closing gesture. Relationships remain static (no second on-page character), but personal evolution earns the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Mosaic closure lands: “time-strands twist, knitting ruins into wholeness”—a perceptible reversal with felt cost. The causal lens holds (failure of Revolt → shard-catalyzed revision). Transition between cathedral chambers is one shard/one transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Asteroid cathedral and glowing strands create sensory immediacy; shards serve as micro-setting constraining Elias’s vault-light ritual. Spatial choreography is clear; earlier baroque rises haven’t appeared on-page so no cap is triggered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove the Republic wasn’t anarchy. Escalation compresses to Elias’s fragment experimentation and the vision in the final 20%. Cost (let dreams splinter) is visible and propels the turnaround.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from Elias’s attempt to turn failure into poem; no moralizing, only the burnished sorrow image in the cathedral dome. The final shot reweights “time” from curse to beauty without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Poetic third-person voice is controlled, rhythmically compressed under pressure; no head-hopping. Interior diction stays architect/poet. Dialogue is brief but goal-oriented (“You’re letting it speak”), subtext-loaded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear is strong; deliberate density supports mood without purple muddle. No loops or scaffold; every sentence pushes state or stakes. Minimal filters—emotions are embodied in “burnished sorrow.”</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Emergence is fresh: a failed rebellion repurposed as lyric elegy. Specific asteroid legend + vase lattice transcend generic revolution trope. Risk in overtly romantic tone pays off in final reversion of time.</comment>
