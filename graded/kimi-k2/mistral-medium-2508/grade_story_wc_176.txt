<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s interiority is vivid—her guilt over the last speaker’s death is embodied in the “molten silver” moment and the rope’s hair. The final choice to let the names change is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the card dissolves, the rope reseals). The only cap is the lack of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rope’s seamless re-braiding reweights memory from static preservation to living transmission. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (aurora, ice, rope, card) intensifies until the final image crystallizes cost. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sanctum, rope, and aurora are not backdrop but active constraints: the ice walls weep, the rope’s strands are syllables, the aurora answers. Micro-setting (the card scrap) functions as setting when it’s woven into the rope’s core. One hairline slip: “snowmelt ardor” edges toward purple, but it’s brief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving the forgotten names—tightens once when Elira chooses reconfiguration over hoarding. The cost is the card’s dissolution and the rope’s irrevocable change. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. The single deepening suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: memory must be allowed to evolve or it ossifies. The final image (aurora turning memory into light) offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph; ambiguity is purposeful and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“blue-dark,” “snowmelt ardor,” “chiseling regrets from her own ribs.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (punched card as memory) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes. One mixed metaphor—“embers in snow”—is minor. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Final third is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses Inuit-inflected ice-magic with data-storage via punched card and ancestral hair-rope—specific, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of preservation into living transmission feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
