<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—clinging to control while learning release—drives every micro-choice; the laser pulse she adds to the mycelium is a credible renunciation that costs her the scanner and her old identity. Elias is sketched only as witness, but his hushed “You see?” reframes her grief without stealing focus. The sister’s death is a reflective block that tilts the present choice and meets BRR limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers pattern (mushroom pulses, scanner cracks, laser dot) until the final image reweights the premise—walls are permeable, loss is transmittable. Closure is a Charged Poise: Lena steps through an unopened door, leaving the scanner behind; the cost is the tangible forfeiture of her last tool and the ache she finally releases. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The domed farm’s permeable membrane, glowing mycelium, and cracked scanner screen function as micro-setting that literally constrains movement and meaning; the teal/red light collision charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—Lena notices only what her spatial gift and grief prioritize. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: prove some walls should be permeable—signaled early via Elias’s call. One tightening beat: Lena’s decision to pulse the laser into the network forecloses her technician identity and pays the scanner as cost. Pressure grows through pattern intensification under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of permeability vs. control emerges from concrete events—mushrooms, scanner, laser—never stated. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: letting go is not abandonment but transmission. Subtext in Elias’s quiet exhale and Lena’s twitching finger carries more than any declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, slightly noir-technical, consistent with a former security tech who still scans for intrusions. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She pressed the laser button, not to cut or measure”—mirroring her narrowing options. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and motive. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats—longer cadence for grief, clipped pulses for action. Final line lands clean without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bioluminescent agriculture, intrusion-detection metaphor, and grief work feels inevitable yet fresh. The “familiar strangers” concept is literalized in fungal networks and reweighted at closure. Risky quiet ending pays off with conceptual repricing rather than spectacle.</comment>
