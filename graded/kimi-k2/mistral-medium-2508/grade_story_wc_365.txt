<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s sensory-mapping interiority is vivid and specific; her contradictory impulses (curiosity vs caution) act simultaneously. The final choice to step through the seam is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost: she relinquishes the familiar map for an open-ended weave. Secondary character pressure is minimal—only the man’s half-remembered voice—so relationship crucible is not tested. The flaw of compulsive seeking is dramatized and confronted, not merely labeled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora becomes “the map now,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence tighten until the final seam opens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. Causality holds: shard → seam → choice → new world, each beat because/therefore linked.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The repair bay’s rust, ozone, and dying lights are selective and purposeful, constraining movement and mood. Micro-setting (the cargo lift, intercom crackle) functions as tactile obstacles. The green glow of the seam reprises the shard’s color, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the withheld truth—is signaled early and escalates through each beat: shard found, seam appears, voice warns, choice crystallizes. One meaningful tightening: the seam snaps shut, forcing Liora to stop looking and start choosing. Cost is felt in the shard’s transformation and her relinquishment of the old map.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inseparability of map-maker and map; truth is not found but woven. Subtext lives in gesture (pocketing the shard, squeezing the man’s hand) rather than declaration. Final image—“the universe bent to meet her”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers but is coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature (“lattice of vibrations, scents, and the faintest electric thrum”) is character-specific. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors (“rusted girders groaning like bones”) are vivid without overwriting. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short bursts at the seam, longer breaths during reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Parallel-universe travel is familiar, yet the sensory-map conceit and shard-as-knot twist it into fresh territory. The man’s half-remembered face and the shard’s color shift feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of scent, texture, and sound anchors the speculative frame.</comment>
