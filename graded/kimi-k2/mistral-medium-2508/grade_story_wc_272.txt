<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—clinging to broken frames while choosing to become the canvas—is embodied in micro-choices (gathering, redesigning, releasing the box). The final renunciation costs her identity as artist and is foreshadowed by every earlier hesitation; no unmotivated leap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dark becomes a “luminescent ache” that reweights all prior images. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each tarot fragment’s re-weaving tightens the pattern until the lighthouse’s final exhale. No orientation debt; disorientation is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library is not backdrop; its leaning walls and salt-stained pages physically constrain movement and supply the tarot fragments that become the map. The setting’s slow collapse mirrors Elara’s surrender, charging the final image of dark as presence rather than absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the broken frames—tightens as the walls close in and the tarot re-weaving forecloses retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: density of fragments, breath, and dark intensifies until the final choice costs her former self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the refusal to repair what is already shattered; the “necessary dark” is not nihilism but acceptance of fracture as truth. No explicit moralizing—the final image of floating fragments and bruised sky reconfigures meaning without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature in phrases like “salt and old parchment, the kind of scent that clung to the back of the throat.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under collapse, longer breaths in surrender—without ever breaking POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each metaphor earns its place (“Tower’s lightning a jagged tear”) and advances atmosphere or choice. No loops, no mixed vehicles, no filter-verb stacks. Final cadence slows to crystallize the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms the familiar “artist confronts loss” trope by making the act of painting the act of self-dissolution. The lighthouse-library and tarot fragments are specific to this voice; remove them and the entire logic collapses. Risky, coherent, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
