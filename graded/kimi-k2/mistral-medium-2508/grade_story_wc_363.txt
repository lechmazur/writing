<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spinner’s interiority is embodied in trembling fingers and breath-fogged air; her contradictory impulses—yearning versus renunciation—surface in the moment she cracks the bead with her teeth. Motivation remains consistent and escalates to the final choice to stay while the tapestry departs. The Earned Stasis (she remains, bones woven into roots) carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by the orchard’s patient absorption. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry dissolves into distance and the spinner becomes part of the orchard, cost paid on page (“the sender must stay”). Causal chain—bead → silence → tapestry → vanishing—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored early (“forgotten orchard… damp air”). Mosaic structure (two shards) is taught by 25 % and transitions cleanly. No plot amnesia or teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is micro-focused: the loom, the skeletal apple tree, the bead half-buried in loam. Each object constrains action—loom anchors ritual, bead supplies silence, tree receives final tapestry. Sensory selection is urgent (warm amber, fogged breath). Bamboo and orchard evolve with the spinner’s absorption. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—send message across impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the bead is cracked. Agency is renunciation: she completes the tapestry knowing she cannot follow. Cost is on-page (“the sender must stay”). Pressure escalates through the loom’s glow and the tapestry’s dissolution. No coincidence resolves conflict; silence is earned resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice and unbridgeable distance emerges from concrete acts—cracking bead, weaving silence, dissolving tapestry. Final image of the traveler finding a humming silver thread reweights the orchard’s patience into legacy. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the wind’s whisper. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing bead to ear) and silence itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “raveling silence that coiled like smoke” teaches the pattern early. POV remains single and stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is tactile and mythic, consistent with spinner’s craft. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for ritual, short for dissolution. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line advances image or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful (“embers under ash”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports breath and urgency. Clean grammar; pronoun references unambiguous. Final line (“a loom began to hum”) recharges motif without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mythic loom-weaving and cosmic bridge feels fresh; bead-as-silence is non-obvious. Transformation test: story would collapse if bead were merely glass. Specificity of orchard-bamboo locale resists generic fantasy. Risk in lyric mosaic pays off; closure remains legible. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
