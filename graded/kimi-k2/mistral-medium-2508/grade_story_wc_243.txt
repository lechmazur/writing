<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—her fingers brushing violets, the locket’s edge pressed to her chest—but the final choice to “steep the past into the present” is more stated than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully foreclosed on the page, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ink, violets, tide) thickens until the final image reweights the covenant as “breathing.” Closure is a Charged Poise—she walks away carrying the vellum—cost legible in the fading blooms and the bell’s two strokes marking irrevocable change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Jetty, violets, salt-bleached wood, and walnut ink are vivid and selective; the blooming jetty itself constrains her kneeling posture and later frames her exit, charging the final image. Micro-setting (locket edge through vellum) also functions as tactile anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early; pressure tightens as twilight deepens and the tide pulls. One decisive intensification: she commits the photo to ink and vellum, narrowing options. Cost is the irreversible fading of the living violets beneath her feet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of memory as covenant emerges through concrete particulars—ink from his tree, violets in cracks—never abstracted. Final image of the jetty “dreaming of ink and violets” offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature filters every detail through her archival precision. Syntax modulates with emotional rise—short clauses under the star’s “needle’s prick,” longer breaths during steeping. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“ink dried dark as the jetty’s shadows”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“regenerated covenant”) is voice-motivated and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Familiar tropes—memory, loss, ritual—are transformed through the specific occupation of walnut-ink archivist and the blooming jetty as living archive. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk lies in the quiet lyric mode that trusts image over plot, and it succeeds.</comment>
