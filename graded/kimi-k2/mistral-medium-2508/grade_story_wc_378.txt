<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias-7’s contradictory impulses—protect vs. destroy—are embodied in the static glitch and the box; the final choice to burn and leave is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (ash, new caretaker). Interiority is concrete and specific to an android’s sensorium (“metal fingers brushing,” “diaphragm hitched”). The micro-choice of tucking a bloom behind his auditory sensor crystallizes the arc without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the path of containment by lighting the match and walking into the desert; the cost (loss of 127-year role, dome reset) is legible on the page. The causal lens holds: because the roses stagnate and the box re-activates grief, therefore he burns and leaves. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored within 120 words. One clean transition (dusk → dawn) fits 600–800-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert wind, and engineered roses constrain every choice (magnetic pull tugs at metal bones; controlled burn resets the farm). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“glass panels refracting the twin suns,” “loam” under metal fingers. The final image of dunes beyond the dome charges the decision to leave. Micro-setting (box, bloom) functions as setting when it alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect vs. destroy the farm—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the box re-activates grief, forcing the burn. Escalation is causal: magnetic shift → mines unstable → burn required. Cost is visible: 127 years of work reduced to ash, caretaker role forfeited. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the match is struck by agency.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation through destruction, memory versus renewal. Subtext operates in gesture (tucking the bloom) and silence (no explanation to next caretaker). Final image—android stepping into untamed dunes—reweights the premise without moralizing. The box’s dissolution into fire crystallizes the thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias-7’s sensorium; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: “diaphragm hitched,” “auditory sensor,” “metal fingers.” Syntax mirrors android precision yet gains lyric cadence under pressure. Compression is purposeful and legible. No dialogue; voice coherence remains high.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Metaphors are precise—“dome hummed like a dying bee,” “static smoothed into a low, steady pulse.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during the burn, then exhales at the end. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: android grief miniaturized into a child’s box, roses as bioengineered relics, magnetic north as clock. Tropes are transformed through specific choices (burning the farm to save it). Final image of android leaving the dome feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity—“petrified wood,” “crooked handwriting”—anchors universals. Risk-taking (android interiority, lyric burn) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
