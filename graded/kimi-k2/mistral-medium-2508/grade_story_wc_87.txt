<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—fleeing vs. facing—are embodied in the compass vs. poles tension; the final renunciation to “stay” is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (the hollow in his chest). Interiority is concrete, but a few stock phrases (“ghost with a paddle,” “swallowed apologies”) slightly dilute specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the sea-path and turns inland; the cost is legible in the compass digging into his ribs and the weight of unread letters. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each pole counted reweights regret until the pattern breaks with the backward count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Coastal launch, leaning utility pole, and brass compass are vivid and selective; the compass-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice by its warmth and weight. Spatial choreography is clean; only the jasmine scent risks overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—alignment of inner compass with lived responsibility—tightens via the pole-counting ritual; the final refusal to paddle out crystallizes the cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of “navigation as presence, not escape” emerges organically from Elias’s choices; the compass’s reweighting from guide to relic charges the final image without moralizing. Subtext in the bartender’s single line lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct salt-worn, regret-soaked voice; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s nautical lens. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer cadences in reflection. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One minor loop—“weight in his chest” echoed twice—barely registers. Final image of neon “dying star” is precise and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar prodigal-father arc is refreshed by the utility-pole navigation conceit and the compass’s inversion from tool to burden. Specific coastal details and the merrily-melancholic laugh keep it from cliché.</comment>
