<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Veyra’s interiority and motive remain consistent; the shift from pilot to gardener is credibly embodied through her micro-choice of cradling the sapling. The contradiction—“I’m here to chart, but now I must plant”—is dramatized in body and tool use. Still, the absence of any second on-page character prevents relational crucible testing, and emotional calibration is almost lyrically perfect, lacking genuine messy mis-readings.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain (glider → arch → fracture → seed → sapling) lands an Earned Stasis closure framed as Charged Poise: she chooses to plant and to listen, foreclosing flight as sole identity. Gravity inversion acts as taught pattern, its reversal not coincidence but environmental rule, tightening choices. The arrow crumbles on cue, a clean Decisive Change with felt cost that re-weights prior mentor echoes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet isn’t merely exotic backdrop; its inverted river, floating arches, and time-locked gravity directly constrain Veyra’s flight tactics and final destination. Sensory details are character-scaled and pressure-bound, not catalogued, and final return to core is spatialized in the last image. The floating boulder moss even becomes the tactile conduit for the planet’s voice, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (“find the source of resilience”) escalate cleanly: flight path narrows as water flows upward, fruit hangs like clocks, and Veyra’s body pays the cost when moss invades her pulse. One meaningful tightening—“plant it or lose it”—renders the inversion hour a live clock. Cost is visibly felt in her tingling veins, an embodied price that reshapes next flight vector toward the core.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thematic resolution—“resilience isn’t found, it’s grown”—emerges through image (sapling in cupped palm) not axiom. Echoes shift from ghosts to instructions in the final beats, re-weighting prior mentor voice; still, the near-explicit “we grow resilience” in second-to-last paragraph nudges toward thematic label-speak. The cost and image remain resonant, but the articulation could be quieter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Tone remains lyric-scientific: precise, sensorily kinetic, yet compressed (“fruit thudding back to branches”). Voice stays within pilot lexicon without register drift. Purposeful elision (dialogue absent, mentor voice paraphrased) is taught early and closure-legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentences flow with varied rhythm, dense imagery, no paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated diction (“weaving silver paths through the air”) edges purple but occurs in calmer beat and does not obscure causality. Minor filter-phrase “felt the whirling silence bloom” dips into texture over action but is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>A terraforming planet that inverts gravity every hour is rare, yet the pilot-to-gardener stance crystallization keeps the synthesis personal rather than spectacle-driven. The inversion as agricultural heartbeat, arches as mouths, and bioluminescent moss as communicator all feel organically devised—not ornament. Transformation of the quest object from arrow to seed to sapling is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
