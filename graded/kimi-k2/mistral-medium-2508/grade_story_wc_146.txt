<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tuner’s patience and embodied ritual (fork to temple, metronomic steps) are vivid and consistent, but his interior contradiction—why this town, why now—remains abstract; the final “balance is a thing you kept” lands as thematic summary rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s first child-laughter reweights the premise from silence to fragile revival; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—rhythmic density and cadence shift rather than causal chain. The cost is felt in the tuner’s aching legs and the archway’s groan, but the ellipsis of “why this town” keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Stone, wind, dust, and the fork’s weight are sensuously precise; the archway’s settling and the warming cobbles constrain the tuner’s pace and charge the final image. Micro-setting (well-stones, shutter) functions as active pressure rather than postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the town’s heartbeat—is signaled early; escalation is the thickening texture of ghost-sounds and light, tightening until the child’s laughter crystallizes the revival. Cost is the tuner’s bodily exhaustion and the arch’s precarious hold, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of balance-as-maintenance emerges organically from the tuner’s ritual and the town’s reluctant awakening; the final line reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the whispered “You’re late” and the laughter’s brightness invites lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “dust of forgotten things,” “rust and gold,” “wild hush.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature—sound as tactile pulse—remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic freight without overwriting. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold in “the town was listening” could tighten, but artifacts never touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Reviving a ghost town through footfall rhythm is fresh; the tuner as itinerant sonic healer avoids cliché. Specificity of the ebony fork and the metronomic steps transforms a familiar resurrection trope into an inevitable, earned cadence.</comment>
