<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s analytic detachment and grief-anchored restraint are embodied in micro-choices—nudging the globe, pocketing the notebook, choosing silence—each carrying visible cost. The final renunciation (“let go of the need to know”) is earned by prior beats that show her habitual compulsion to chase last transmissions. Interior contradiction surfaces when the analytic mind confronts the impossible snow; the moment is specific, not diagnostic. The sister photograph and the withheld report crystallize the personal stake without exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Liora files the lie, foreclosing the path of revelation with a felt moral cost (“Some things were heavier than truth”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of threshold imagery (horizon, lighthouse beam, snow directions) reweights the premise until the final quiet sea. Causality is intact: each impossible detail (snow falling upward, sideways) tightens the uncanny pressure that forces her stance crystallization. No orientation drift; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned library’s warped mahogany, bioluminescent fish, and the uncannily pristine snow globe function as micro-setting that constrains choice—she must decide whether to disturb or leave the impossible object. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: gloved finger on glass, breath fogging, pressure of dive suit. Spatial choreography is clean; objects track across beats. The globe’s light pulsing like a heartbeat charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightened when the globe’s snow reverses gravity. One decisive intensification: the upward snowfall forces Liora to recognize the cost of knowledge and choose silence. Agency is renunciation; the price is the lie she will live with. Coincidence (impossible globe) complicates rather than resolves, consistent with Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between knowledge and mercy; the final image of sideways-falling snow reweights Amelia’s “threshold” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the inscription “cost of light” and the withheld report. The story invites reflection on what should remain unrecovered. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is carried by image and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, marine-science inflected, and emotionally restrained: “cloying pressure of the dive suit,” “pocked with holes…from something passing through.” Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during ascent, longer reflective cadences in the bunk. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Liora. Distinct perceptual signature notices counterclockwise snow and bioluminescent “fallen stars.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“ghosts of light,” “sugar in tea.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening line anchors voice and mystery; final line resolves by image (“the sea, finally, was quiet”) that recharges earlier motifs. High information density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fuses Amelia Earhart myth, quantum-entanglement research vessel, and impossible snow globe into a fresh meditation on thresholds. The conceit of a last transmission that warns against retrieval feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the notebook’s fused pages and the lighthouse coordinates grounds the speculative element. Risk-taking (non-linear causality, lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
