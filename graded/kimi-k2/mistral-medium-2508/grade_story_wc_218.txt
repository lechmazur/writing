<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira’s contradictory impulses—devotion vs. defiance—are embodied in her aching joints and copper-wrapped sapling; the final renunciation (death while working) is fully earned and carries visible cost. Tomas’s curiosity and eventual adoption of her stance create a crucible that alters the relationship state. Interiority is specific, tactile, and free of therapy-speak. Only a hairline slip: the “laughed, because what else” line edges toward convenient self-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s new shape and Tomas’s copper-wrapped wrist crystallize the cost of Elira’s life-work. Causal chain—diagnosis → refusal of hospice → final graft → death in situ—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; the pillars’ breathing teaches the pattern early. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural drive tightens through density and cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The living stone pillars, copper wire, and orchard form a micro-setting that actively constrains every choice; the sapling’s twist around the pillar’s flaw is the final image that reweights the premise. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—warm metal, creaking wood—filtered through Elira’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. One minor missed beat: no scent layer to deepen the fungal chambers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—remodel the orchard before death—is signaled early and tightened by the six-month clock. One meaningful deepening: the elders’ demand to uproot the sapling forces Elira’s last act of defiance. Cost is visceral—her hand still warm on the branch. Agency drives every beat; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of respectful symbiosis emerges from the copper-oak marriage and Elira’s final line; no authorial thesis intrudes. Subtext lives in gesture: Tomas’s copper bracelet speaks louder than any manifesto. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is preserved—elders are wrong yet not caricatured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; the stone “breathed” and copper “oxidized just enough” carry Elira’s scientific devotion. Rhythm modulates with pain—short clauses under stress, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored to Elira until the final paragraph, where Tomas’s perception is external and brief. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: “teaching them to ask” versus “beg.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“wind through dead leaves” is earned. High information density: “copper oxidized just enough to feed the trees without poisoning them” does triple duty. No register drift or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—temple orchard as living architecture tended by dying caretaker—feels fresh yet inevitable. Copper-wire symbiosis is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity grounds the concept; no quirky ornament for its own sake. Transformation test passes: swap names or places and the arc collapses.</comment>
