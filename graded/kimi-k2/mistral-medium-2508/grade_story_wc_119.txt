<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chen’s interiority is vivid—ink, incense, trembling hands—but the final renunciation (“wasn’t running… transposing life”) is asserted more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet slightly under-embodied. Secondary characters (fisherman’s daughter, cook) serve as pressure vectors rather than relationships, so crucible effect is thin. Still, micro-choices (slipping the microdot, writing the ticket) align with motive and flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Chen boards the train, lighthouse dark, silence itself a warning—cost is legible in the extinguished beam and twenty-year abandonment. Causal chain holds: fisherman → microdot → fortune slip → daughter → train. Mosaic shards (diner, tower, train) are taught early and cohere under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse’s brass study, Fresnel lens, and inkwell are tactile constraints; the darkened tower at the end reweights the setting into a final warning. Salt air, incense smoke, and train glass are selective sensory anchors filtered through Chen’s ritual precision. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the flow of open secrets while surviving exposure—tightens when the daughter warns “They’re coming.” One decisive turn: Chen relinquishes the film and the lighthouse. Cost is visible in the extinguished beacon and one-way ticket; agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of open secrets emerges through fortunes that hide state weapons in plain sight; final image of the dark lighthouse reconfigures the premise—secrecy persists by relocation, not revelation. Subtext in the fortunes (“the hum you ignore…”) resonates without moralizing. Complexity is honored: Chen neither triumphs nor atones, simply transposes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, ritualistic, salted with aphoristic fortune cadences that remain character-bound. Compression (“ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce”) teaches the pattern early; payoff in the final fortune tucked in the doorframe. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, information-dense; metaphors (lens “like a blade,” smoke “curling like question marks”) serve rather than stall. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“transposing life into a new key”) is earned by Chen’s reflective stance. Final line’s pulse/heartbeat/lens triad lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing Cold-War microdot thriller with Taoist fortune-cookie mysticism feels inevitable yet fresh; the lighthouse as clandestine relay station is specific and memorable. Transformation test passes—names and places could not be swapped without breaking the concept. Risk in quiet, lyric closure heightens resonance.</comment>
