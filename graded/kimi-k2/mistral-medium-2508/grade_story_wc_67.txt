<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is sensuous—“mask’s edges bit deeper as she smiled”—but motive (“to keep the lie beautiful”) is asserted rather than dramatized in choice; the charcoal burn reads more ritual than dilemma, softening cost. Still, Liora’s contradiction—destroying to reveal—threads through embodied detail and shapes every micro-movement, keeping her individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The piece runs Accumulative/Textural: each burn, scatter, powder settle is a re-wrought iteration tightening the same central stake (“truth through disappearance”). Closure—ashes arranged as a “careful absence” left for morning—earns Earned Stasis where the cost is the impossibility of possession, redefining “mirage of safety” without verbal gloss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gallery steeped in odor and vanishing depth seeds the spatial metaphor for unreachable meaning early; the mask reappears with literal weight and re-configured light, constraining final action (she cannot step beyond fracture). Sensory precision is sharp, but setting details are mostly stage rather than tool after the initial burn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Central stake—truth as illusion—is repeatedly pressure-tested: each burn removes one more layer to “understand,” then escalates to the next portrait. No single external threat, yet Liora’s agency sharpens a single axis: destruction is the only access to creation, cost explicit when she cannot risk recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from iterative ritual; no didactic statement survives burn three. Final tableau of “face made of light and memory and the absence of answers” reweights all prior portraits as Conceptual Repricing without preaching. The mirage of safety lingers unresolved yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Lyric, tactile control—fragments of porcelain, refracted shards, the chair “slowing as if exhausted by time”—creates a perceptual signature distinct to Liora. Line syntax varies with scene pulse; one POV held steady, no leakage, voice intimate yet unsentimental throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dense, rhythmic layering—“powder lifting like the first snow on a grave”—compresses image and motion; no scaffold loops, every line advances. Metaphor is internally coherent (shard ↔ memory light) without overwriting; clarity preserved under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Portrait burned into non-portrait crystallizes “art as disappearance” with fresh, paradoxical stakes (opposite of preservation). Repetition of scatter-burn-walk cycle never feels template; risk is sustained rather than gimmicked, anchored in tactile cost.</comment>
