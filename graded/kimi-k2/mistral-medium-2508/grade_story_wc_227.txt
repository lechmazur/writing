<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interior contradiction—yearning to mend yet fearing insufficiency—is embodied in trembling fingers and mercury eyes; the final surrender feels earned because every prior beat braided doubt into action. Micro-choices (pressing the key, narrating to the void) reveal a hierarchy of values: repair over survival. Cost is visible in the dissolving workshop and relinquished control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the statue’s grip lifts the alchemist at the moment the sea claims the workshop, reconfiguring “mending” from act to submission. Causal chain holds—each key’s history motivates the final turn; the third key’s glow is the earned image of cost. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scars, keys, and sea tightens until meaning reframes survival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Acid sea and corroding hull are not backdrop but countdown; the brass ribs and copper stink constrain every move. The workshop’s dissolution is tracked beam by beam, forcing the final choice. Micro-setting of the statue’s scarred chest becomes the crucible where world and self fuse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“What if it’s not enough?”—is tested by rising acid and internal doubt; the tightening beat is the key turning, which forecloses retreat. Cost is the workshop’s loss and the alchemist’s bodily surrender. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens: each remembered scar adds weight until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of kintsugi for the soul emerges from concrete acts: stitching laughter into coats, pressing keys into scars. Final image—gold of broken world holding together—reweights prior failures into luminous necessity without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence after the last breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, and character-bound: “acid sea gnawed at the hull,” “mercury pupils.” Compression and elision (“three breaths left, maybe four”) teach the pattern early and pay off in the breath-held silence of closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under extremity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and precise: “the stone shuddered” carries both physical and metaphysical tremor. Figurative language is selective—“scream frozen mid-birth”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Final cadence shift into silence is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kintsugi reimagined as apocalyptic rescue, acid sea as both destroyer and crucible. Risky lyric compression succeeds because pattern is taught early and closure remains legible. Specificity of mismatched keys and drowned clockwork bird anchors the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
