<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lena’s longing is embodied in her tactile ritual with the piano and clock; her strategic creativity shows in the spliced film and compass use. The final reunion is earned because every beat—winding the clock, threading the reel, following the projected path—flows from her refusal to surrender memory. Cost is visible: the projector bulb burns out, the arbor settles, the past is let go. Minor slip: “steely longing” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock ticks, compasses still, door opens, reunion lands with felt cost of years lost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of musical notes, flickering images, and compass needles tighten until the final cadence reweights all prior motifs. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (projector → door) is taught early via the film splice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal arbor’s salt-stained piano, mist-wrapped branches, and ozone-scented refuge are vivid and selective. Setting constrains choice: only the film-projected path reveals the door; the arbor’s groan syncs with the clock’s first swing. Micro-setting (clock in arms, reel under bench) functions as pressure tool. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will Lena breach the sealed past and reclaim her lover? Pressure escalates via the ticking horizon and the single-use film path; each beat narrows options until the door is the only exit. Cost is the burned-out bulb and the irrevocable passage of years. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (compass alignment) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of time’s irreversibility and the cost of clinging to ghosts emerges through the stalled clock, spliced film, and final living pendulum. Subtext in the half-remembered tune and silent ticking carries more weight than any statement. Final image of two silhouettes suspended above the clouds offers a non-literal answer: love persists but only by accepting loss. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control matching the musical motif. Perceptual signature is Lena’s: salt-stained ivories, compass needles like dying fireflies. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Dialogue is spare and subtext-laden (“You’re late” / “So are you”), advancing reunion without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (“wind hummed… like a half-remembered tune”) is purposeful and pattern-taught. High information density: piano keys as ghosts, film frames as map, clock as heart. Minor over-modification in “gnarled branches above the clouds” but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: skyborne tidal arbor, film-reel portal, and compass-guided reunion transform familiar lost-love trope into something uncanny. Risk-taking (nonlinear film path as literal door) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of salt-stained piano and cracked brass face anchors the fantastical. No derivative echoes; the ending feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
