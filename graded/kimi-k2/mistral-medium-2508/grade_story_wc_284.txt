<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—prudence vs. daring—are dramatized in the pillbox beat and crystallize in her final step; the cost (leaving the empty box) is felt. Interiority is embodied and specific (“silvered stains of a hundred fires”). The ally’s brief presence supplies relational pressure that alters her stance. Minor slip: the ally’s dialogue is slightly expository.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lena’s decision to “vouchsafe one last thing” forecloses retreat and carries visible cost (abandoning the pillbox). Causal lens holds: message → meeting → key → choice. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist and thawing snow constrain visibility and sound, shaping Lena’s tactics and the ally’s approach. The cedar’s frost-bitten bark and the pillbox’s glint serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Weather subtly mirrors internal thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“finish it” vs. self-preservation—tightens once when the key forces a choice. Escalation is causal: message → pillbox → coordinates → step forward. Cost is legible in the abandoned pillbox and the phrase “not for them.” No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “fixing what’s broken” emerges through action and object rather than statement; the pillbox and key literalize the metaphor. Final image of spring coming reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the ally’s “They’re not asking you to come back” carries layered meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, weathered, and consistent with a burned spy’s perceptual signature. Syntax tightens under pressure (“mist swallowing his boots”). No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Dialogue is minimal but subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“wind forgets its name”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Sentences advance story or atmosphere without padding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The spy-returns trope is refreshed by focusing on aftermath and internal reckoning rather than mission mechanics. Specific details (ciphered pillbox, frost-bitten cedar) root the story uniquely. The final step into spring feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
