<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s contradictory impulses—cynicism born of pyramid trauma vs hunger for agency—are dramatized in her palm-bleeding squeeze of the bolt; the diamond’s warmth against her thigh is a felt cost that forecloses return to the farm. Interiority is concrete and embodied, not therapeutic. The single POV holds without drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bolt’s unthreading reweights “pressure” and “diamond” in a single image, costing Lina the bolt itself and any lingering debt to the loop. Causal linkage (bolt twist → submarine re-knits → diamond forms) holds under a Causal lens; the final refusal to check the phone is Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The damp mushroom farm anchors who/where by line 3; its bioluminescence constrains visibility and later dims to embers, charging the final image. The submarine’s ghostly hull appears as compressed setting-memory, tightening space. Sensory selection (indigo pulse, ozone wind) is filtered through Lina’s scam-honed vigilance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate pressure into agency without new exploitation—is signaled early and tightened when the bolt’s twist forces a choice: break the loop or become it. Escalation is causal and single-cycle; the price is the bolt’s erasure and the irreversible step into the desert. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the transformation of “pressure makes diamonds” from corporate mantra to lived, bleeding choice. Subtext operates in the silence after the final buzz; the diamond’s laugh-like facets reweight prior scams without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—loop broken or merely bent—yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and specific to Lina’s scam-scarred perceptual lens (“promises were currency”). Compression (“Pressure is a gift. Translate it.”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Register stays within plausible survivor argot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense—each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective (“threads of light”). Final paragraph cadence mirrors the loosening grip of the loop. Clean mechanics; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The submarine bolt as compressed regret, the quantum promise as literalized pyramid scheme, and the diamond as reparative theft synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky conceptual leap lands because every beat roots in Lina’s specific trauma. No derivative echoes.</comment>
