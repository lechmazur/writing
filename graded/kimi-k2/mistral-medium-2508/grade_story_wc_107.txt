<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for answers yet fearing the cost—are embodied in her tactile handling of the bookmark and the valve. The final renunciation (leaving the room to the flood) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she abandons the sanctuary she once fled. Interiority is specific and glass-centric, avoiding stock phrases. Only the “thoughtfully spirited” label remains slightly abstract, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the flood rewrites the ruins while Elara walks away, bookmark left as invitation/warning. Causal chain holds—thaw reveals blueprint → bookmark cues sequence → valve releases flood. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the relinquished control room and the unrecognizable path ahead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The control room’s frost, dripping ceiling, and retreating glacier constrain every move; the thawing ice literally enables the flood sequence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“frost-starred window,” “rivulets snaking”). The cracked bookmark functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. No orientation debt; environment shapes tactics to the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to finish her father’s “controlled collapse”—is signaled by the second bookmark. Escalation tightens once: turning the valve irreversibly floods the chambers, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the sanctuary itself. Agency is hers; coincidence only reveals, never rescues. Pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of inquiry’s necessary risk emerges through concrete action: the thaw exposes both blueprint and danger. Final image—Elara blowing glass from shards—offers non-literal answer: creation from ruin. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the bookmark’s dual signal. Subtext resides in silence, water, and fracture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is glassblower-specific: molten memory, vessels for questions, cooling flaws. Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured narration during thaw, clipped release when valve opens. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“her breath a fleeting sculpture”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “the light catching the jagged edge,” “water hissed like a held note.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are precise and physics-respectful. Minor elevation (“sanctuary for the curious”) is voice-motivated. Final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-climate-collapse control room as crucible for inquiry is fresh; the thaw-as-catalyst inverts usual frozen-world tropes. Bookmark’s crack as record, not wound, reweights flaw into strength. Risk—turning sanctuary into flood—pays off. Synthesis feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
