<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drive—debunker who secretly prays—remains embodied in micro-choices (pressing shell to cello, writing on skin). Interiority is specific, embodied, and culminates in a credible renunciation of his former stance with visible cost (blank shell, dissolved journal). No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Meets 9+ quick test except for slight under-dramatized flaw compounding before final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes from solver to keeper, cost legible in blank shell and vanished notes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of humming voices and dissolving pages tightens until final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One transition (memory flash) is brief and taught early. Closure beat earns 9+ under lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Observatory, cello, and shell function as micro-setting that constrains action: warped floor limits movement, hollow cello enables resonance, shell’s glow guides final choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“salt on skin,” “dust from rafters”). Setting evolves with events—walls tremble under story-weight. Meets 9+ gate: shell charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode vs harmonize—tightens once when Elias realizes the riddle is a ledger he must add to. Escalation is Accumulative: voices layer, pages dissolve, shell glows, each intensifying cost. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. Felt price (blank shell, lost journal) is on-page. Sufficient for 8.8 band but micro-turn could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: myths are collaborative songs, not puzzles to solve. Subtext carried in shell’s shift from map to blank witness. Final image (“The riddle answers back” inked on skin) offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic echo in final paragraph. Complexity sustained; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, wry, tactile (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “scraping rust from the bones of the world”). POV stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision taught early (“whisper of closing pages”) and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final line lands with Charged Poise. Minor register drift toward poetic abstraction in one clause only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern (“salt on skin,” “bones of the world”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports rhythm; paragraph cuts clean. One near-paraphrase (“hum” twice in four lines) but does not dull closure. High information density; every line advances stakes or texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—myth buster turned myth keeper via resonant seashell-cello—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (quest object, abandoned observatory) are transformed through embodied specificity and sonic metaphor. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No derivative echoes. Synthesis of music, memory, and myth is non-obvious yet coherent.</comment>
