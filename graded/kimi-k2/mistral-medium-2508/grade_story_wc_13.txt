<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elspeth’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses to preserve the moths and to risk the city’s sleep are embodied in the burning/cold pendant and the ink that bleeds upward. The final act of hurling the jar is credibly motivated by prior beats, and the cost (boy unravels, city’s breath held) is felt. Yet the boy’s motives remain opaque, muting relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s cadence resets, moths return, but the echo’s leash dissolves—cost is the boy’s erasure and the giant’s disturbed nap. Causal chain (ink-key → boy’s demand → jar → echo-leash → city gasp) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is not backdrop; its black water births the ink-key, receives the jar, and rewinds around the boy’s oar, constraining every beat. Micro-setting (pendant, moth wings) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the giant’s awakening—tightens when Elspeth must choose between the moth and the city. One decisive tightening: hurling the jar forecloses retrieval of the boy. Cost is visible (boy unravels, echo leash lost). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of time as living debt emerges through concrete events: borrowed minutes demand repayment, moths dissolve or re-form. No moralizing; final image of “time stretching thin” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the boy’s grin and the pendant’s temperature shift carries the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“canals carved into the rooftops of ancient towers” teaches the pattern early. Compression and elision (“the city held its breath”) are legible at closure. Distinct perceptual signature: Elspeth notices bioluminescent veins and ink defying gravity. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned (“water black and slow as ink”). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with stakes—short clauses under pressure, longer cadences in reflection. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: city as sleeping titan, canals as veins leaking time, moths as living ink. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Premise is transformed through Elspeth’s specific vocation and choices; not swappable. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
