<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is specific—her tactile attention to chalk, the hush before mailing—but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final choice to send the name feels inevitable rather than wrested. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The “carefully inventive” trait is stated, not tested under pressure. Cost is present but soft: the loss is the name’s privacy, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, orientation anchored by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the envelope’s soft *thunk* crystallizes the moment when the name ceases to be hers. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of neon, chalk, ink layers—ending reweights the stake of anonymity. No causality break; ellipsis between wiping chalk and next request is motivated.</comment>

<comment>The golden arcade’s flicker and grit constrain Lena’s low-tech method; the mailbox’s rusted flag becomes the charged object that gates closure. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (binary whispers, candy-wrapper crinkle). Micro-setting (clipboard, mailbox) functions as setting and tool, constraining the final act. No spatial drift.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: preserving anonymity while gifting a new one. Pressure tightens once: from chalk request to irrevocable drop in mailbox. Agency is renunciation—she relinquishes control of the name. Cost is conceptual (loss of ownership) rather than visceral, but legible in the soft *thunk*.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges through action: identity as portable yet sacrificial. Subtext in chalk smudge, ink bleed, and neon ghosts. Final image—her shadow “without leaving ripples”—offers non-literal answer to “meaning in the margins.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena’s perceptual signature: tactile, synesthetic (“neon ghosts,” “chalk grit clings like static”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadence in reflection, clipped before the drop. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal. Purposeful elision of client identity is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “neon ghosts flickering like half-remembered dreams” is earned by context. No loops or scaffold. Information density high—clipboard description doubles as worldbuilding. Metaphors are consistent (sea, tide, moonlight). Minor filter verbs (“she thought”) are voice-motivated.</comment>

<comment>Premise—identity broker in retro arcade—feels fresh via analog ritual vs. neon futurism. Transformation test fails: swap arcade for library and core arc holds, but specificity of chalk, ink, and mailbox anchors it. Risk in low-tech mail pays off in final *thunk*. No close echoes.</comment>
