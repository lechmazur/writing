<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s hunger for serenity is embodied in tactile micro-choices—stealing, planting, pressing the petal—each aligning with her olfactory gift and yielding a credible renunciation. Interior contradiction (craving stillness yet embracing sway) is dramatized, not labeled. The final cost—public exposure of private grief via the flower’s mirror—lands with felt social price. Minor slip: “reckless” vs “precise” tension is asserted more than shown in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s realization that serenity lies in motion, sealed by the unlocked vault and the scented bridge. Causal chain (theft → bloom → mirror → reconfiguration) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat thickens scent and consequence. Cost is legible in the Elders’ softened disapproval and communal shift to trust. One micro-drag: the “next seed taken” beat is summary, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The treetop village is evoked through swaying bridges, salt-tinged bark, and moonstone soil—details that constrain planting choices and charge the final bridge of vines. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Liora’s nose edits the world. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3. The corpse-flower vines reprise setting as tool, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Liora root serenity in perpetual motion?—is signaled early and tightened when the bloom mirrors unspoken fears, forcing her stance crystallization. Escalation is accretive: scent thickens, truths surface, options narrow to acceptance. Cost is communal exposure and personal relinquishment of secrecy. No reversals beyond the single deepening, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom as communal trust rather than individual possession. The corpse flower’s mirror reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext pulses in doodled margins and the unspoken green-for-forgiveness. Final image—scented bridge as invitation—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the serenity question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with olfactory metaphors (“rotting honey, buried secrets”) that remain character-bound. Syntax modulates from languid to urgent as the bloom unfurls. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“the tide turned”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers scent, motion, or consequence. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor risk—“veins of silver” on petals—barely grazes clarity. Rhythm accelerates under pressure without monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—stolen wisdom, corpse flower, tree village—are transformed through olfactory specificity and communal reconfiguration. The scented bridge as closure is a fresh inflection that feels inevitable. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality. No close echoes.</comment>
