<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lior’s interior contradiction—neither thief nor savior—is textured via musk-smear and swallowed truffles; the final renunciation lands with felt cost, yet sister's suicide and archivist remain summarized off-stage voices, muting inner pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single scene resolves on Charged Poise under Causal lens—burying the eye is the act that forecloses future use and shows price; mosaic fragments are taught early by reflective strobe but transitions are seamless; no beat loses causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Orchard-ravine functions as micro-setting and constraint—roots half-exposed by storm dictate where eye must be hidden; selective damp-earth scent and gold-fleck glass lend sensory specificity without tourism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—protecting the eye from those who would “cure” truth—escalates cleanly; truffles-for-silence trade narrows options, and final burial permanently ends leverage warlords can exert; cost sits on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of deception vs occlusion emerges organ-whole; the word “cure” is inverted, and final reprise reconfigures it as burial—an unspoken moral without preachiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Compressed lyric voice handles elision gracefully; perceptual signature smells everything, sees nothing clearly—syntax tightens under storm pressure and eases in after-math without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density, zero filler; metaphors stay anchored in bodily musk or soil—no mixed vehicle violations; minor pattern of dropped pronouns in storm aftermath barely grazes momentum.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Concept of truth-virus and eye-that-reveals is fresh synthesis rather than trope; burial as occlusion flips promised cure into grave gift—specific to this story logic.</question>
