<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—thumb against frayed threads, breath “productive”—and the tutor’s contradictory drive to both unravel and re-weave is dramatized in micro-choices. The final kneel and steady hand show earned change with visible cost (shame absorbed into platinum). Relationship with the girl is brief but functions as crucible: her invitation forces the decisive acceptance. Flaw: the “fourth move” backstory is asserted more than dramatized, slightly blunting motivation intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tutor’s stance crystallizes from exile to belonging via the charged image of the board reset after checkmate. Causal chain holds—each tapestry tug alters the labyrinth’s memory walls, leading to the girl’s invitation and the final steady-handed game. Orientation is anchored early (“edge of the time-frozen village”) and sustained. Minor drift: the “platinum labyrinth” rules are poetic rather than mechanically clear, but this is consistent with the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Setting is filtered through tactile attention—metallic veins, frozen laughter, hearth warmth—each detail constraining choice (labyrinth absorbs regret; tapestry threads resist then yield). The time-frozen village is more than postcard: its stillness forces the tutor’s introspection and later thaw mirrors his internal shift. Micro-setting (the board on the inn table) becomes the charged final object. Platinum labyrinth could be more materially specific, but its reflective function justifies its presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the tapestry confesses “wrong to leave,” forcing the tutor to re-weave rather than flee. Escalation is Accumulative: each tug increases emotional density until the village exhales and the girl’s invitation forecloses exile. Cost is visible—regret absorbed into warm platinum, laughter unfrozen. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of forgiveness emerges from concrete action: re-weaving scars into the tapestry’s border. Subtext operates in silence—the villagers’ unfrozen gestures speak louder than apology. Final image of the girl checkmating him reweights earlier abandonment without moralizing. The thunder’s lull evolves from distant threat to village pulse, a non-literal answer to the tutor’s exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“fingers winnowed through the threads”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. POV remains tightly interior; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural (“Again?”) and carries subtext of invitation, not accusation. Occasional elevated diction (“fierce repose”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer sensory and emotional information without redundancy. Metaphors (“silence were a held breath”) are fresh and coherent. No loops or scaffold; each paragraph advances knowledge or emotional charge. Minor purple moment—“the rhythm of a heart learning to beat without shame”—but it lands within the heightened register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Combines chess, tapestry-weaving, and time-frozen village in a synthesis that feels inevitable: the tutor must literally re-weave past moves. Transformation test: the story would collapse if the chess metaphor were swapped. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final checkmate laugh. Only mild proximity to Borges-style labyrinths keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
