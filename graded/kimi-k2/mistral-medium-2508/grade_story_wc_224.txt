<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to reclaim a buried gift while fearing its cost—drives every beat; the mercury-glass eyes and silver streaks embody the price, and the final act of writing seeds the future with visible sacrifice. The arc from swallowed talent to active keeper lands with earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias writes himself into the ledger, sealing his new role and foreclosing escape. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each remembered image layers density until the final crystallizing act. Cost is legible in the sealed door and the storm in his eyes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore breathes, shivers, and rains dust; shelves and glyphs constrain movement and meaning. The setting is not backdrop but active participant, guiding Elias to the false wall and later sealing the door behind him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim or re-bury the unsaid talent—tightens when the stone’s map reveals internal hollows. The final choice to plant language seeds forecloses denial; the cost is the irreversible acceptance of guardianship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between silence and expression; the stone as mirror and seed embodies the cost of giving voice to what was buried. Final image of the boy’s palm-map offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature of mercury and paper dust; syntax mirrors Elias’s wavering between wonder and dread. Patterned elision (“dreams he substituted for reality”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure, culminating in the quiet final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses body, archive, and language into a living mountain; the transformation of a relic into a seed feels inevitable. Specificity of mercury eyes and feather-texture avoids generic tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
