<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rook’s contradictory impulses—obedience to settlement rules vs. the pull of memory—are dramatized in the moment he stands and follows the cylinder; the leaf’s warmth against his paw embodies the cost. Interiority is specific to a scent-driven mind, and the final endurance inside the dome is earned by prior causality. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Rook’s entry into the dome crystallizes the stake—distance becomes bridge—at visible cost (sealed exit, bones revealed). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echoing phrases (“wound…bridge”) and charged objects (leaf, cylinder) tighten until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scrapyard ribs, cracked wasteland, and the glass dome are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Rook’s path and charges the final image. The leaf’s amber veins and the phonograph’s grooves function as micro-settings that guide choice. Environment and object together foreclose retreat once the dome seals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—tightens when the cylinder’s map forces Rook to break settlement rules; the cost is the irreversible step into the dome. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens: each echo (leaf, voice, script) increases pressure until the final image forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the cylinder’s whisper, the leaf’s pulse, the bones inside vines. Final image of “first garden war” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the vines’ embrace—salvation and entrapment—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, scent-driven, and lyrically compressed; patterned elision (“wild hush,” “tinted revelation”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax mirrors the hound’s cadence—short sniffs of detail, longer mournful stretches. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is disciplined. Occasional elevated diction (“Conceptual Repricing”) is earned by context and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic garden inside a sealed dome, narrated by a retired bloodhound, is a fresh synthesis. The phonograph cylinder as map and the leaf as key transform familiar tropes. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry; the ending feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
