<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his gloved fingers brushing frost, the fragment pulsing against his skin—but the final choice to step onto the ice is more asserted than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior micro-choices. The “shadow-laced” trait is shown through effect rather than label, and the contradiction between pacifier and intervenor is present but not pushed to crisis in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias steps into the space between seeing and doing, mirrors shatter behind him, reconfiguring the stakes with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift carry the turn. Orientation is swift; causality is intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice triad is not backdrop but pressure system: the ice groans “hungry,” the mirrors angle toward the cliff’s edge, constraining Elias’s final move. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the fragment’s glow and the orchard’s bone-clicking branches charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether Elias will intervene—tightens once when he decides to step onto the ice. The cost is the abandonment of his lifelong stance as passive peacekeeper; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without external reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of courage as refusal to let the brave stand alone emerges through image and action, never statement. The final shattering mirrors reweight the motif of fractured sight into wholeness, offering a resonant, non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: “the light itself hesitated to claim him,” “the ice breathe.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. The final line—“The mirrors shattered behind him, their glimpses finally whole”—lands clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lighthouse, orchard, and prophetic mirrors feels inevitable and fresh; the peacekeeper who dulls conflict must now ignite it to save a child is a non-obvious turn. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
