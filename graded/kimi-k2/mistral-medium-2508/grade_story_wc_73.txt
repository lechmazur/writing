<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—grim optimism—drives every micro-choice; the chipped die biting her palm anchors motive in embodied pain. The final renunciation (turning back) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: forfeiting the door. Minor slip: “grim optimist” is stated once rather than dramatized throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s sideways leap rewrites the recursive loop, and the cost is the lost smooth die left on the threshold. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break (die stutter) reweights the premise. No causality breaks; orientation is taught early via the gray haze.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The staircase’s texture—stone, creak, gray haze—constrains every move and charges the final image when it reassembles. Micro-setting (chipped die as tactile anchor) functions as environment. Economy is tight; no static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—tightens when the door appears and Lena refuses it, paying the price of perpetual motion. One meaningful deepening: realization the climb is choice, not prison. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive staircase and the flawed die: opportunity gains value only through irreversibility. Final image (climbing because she wants to) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the dice’s asymmetry is subtle and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet lyric, e.g., “perpetual motion isn’t movement.” Perceptual signature—equations as maps, dice as metronome—remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“gray haze peeled back like fabric”) are vivid and purposeful. One minor register drift—“balancedly daring” feels editorial—but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recursive staircase as missed-opportunity crucible is fresh; the sideways leap to break the loop is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking (mathematical lyricism, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
