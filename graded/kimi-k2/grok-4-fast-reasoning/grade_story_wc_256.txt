<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning is palpable and embodied through the carbide lens and bell, but her contradictory impulses stay largely in reflective summary; no micro-choice visibly risks anything until the final ring, so the cost feels muted rather than paid in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell’s last wave reconfigures isolation→connection with conceptual cost—the lens’s new etchings mark irreversible inner change; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, tightening via refracted song layers; one causality seam—how the lens physically “amplifies doubt into melody”—is hand-waved, but it doesn’t rupture the final reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lab’s archived frequencies act as environment-as-tool: their golden shadows supply both resource and constraint, directly shaping Elara’s pilgrimage choices; carbide scent and prism patterns anchor POV bias; spatial choreography stays clean in the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—texture of connection—tightens once when the bell weaves playground giggles into persistent harmony, foreclosing the assumption that joy is ephemeral; no visible secondary loss or price is dramatized on-page, so escalation feels intellectually rather than viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sound as woven velvet against the soul; the final bell-song internalized offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—connection remains fragile under the grid’s “fragile hum,” resisting tidy solace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice stays stable, modulating from hush to crescendo with bell cadence; perceptual signature filters world through refractive light/sound synesthesia; no dialogue to test, yet diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes with bell pulses; stacked metaphors occasionally clump (“velvet against the soul,” “carbide flicker that amplified doubt into probing melody”) but never obscure causality; one paraphrase loop—“texture of connection” reiterated without new charge—subtracts modest propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sonic-afterlife laboratory plus prism-song bell synthesizes fresh angle on grief-tech; premise commits fully without retreat; risk distinction in treating simulator as spiritual forge rather than gimmick earns +0.3 within band.</comment>
