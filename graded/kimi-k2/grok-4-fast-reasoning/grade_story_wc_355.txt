<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifist-inventor duality is vividly sketched through tactile micro-choices (tuning the clasp with “listener” intent), but interiority drifts into performed lyricism (“eclectic heart fuller”) that abstracts rather than embodies final cost; the diary’s grief is felt, yet his resultant vow is declared, not dramatized, so the interior change registers as sentiment rather than paid-for stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the diary’s silent grief layers build to a resonant reconfiguration—Elias re-weights his life’s project in the hush before fireworks. Orientation is clear by word 60; causality is loose-middle (lock yields by sympathetic vibration, not strict cause-effect), but pattern is taught early and the final image holds legible conceptual cost (he must now amplify these voices). Closure beats cleanly; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Workshop micro-setting is starlit, wire-and-glass lullaby machines constraining hush; the olive-wood stool and brass tuner act as embodied setting that literally enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy skews visual/auditory, but selectivity mirrors Elias’s tinkerer bias; spatial choreography is clean. final image ties the overhead burst to interior reconfiguration, earning high-band constraint charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover silence’s voices—threads every beat; pressure tightens once when the tuner’s hum must align or fail, foreclosing brute force. Stakes remain intellectual/emotional; no concrete external consequence alters tactics, so cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Sufficient for this length, but the tightening is gentle, not option-narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-through-attuned-silence emerges via diary’s unpaid grief, not authorial decree. Final reconfiguration reweights silence from passive absence to active ethical burden, avoiding moral lecture. Some late lyrical abstractions (“eclectic heart fuller”) slightly dilute subtext, but overall resonance is earned through specific particulars of the mother’s entries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s tinkerer idiom: brass filigree “whispering,” circuits as talismans. Syntax swells then hushes in mimicry of tuning arcs; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“theatrical sincerity”) is self-conscious yet consistent with his self-styled gentleness; rhythmic control carries the quiet climax without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentences vary in length and opening. Dense metaphor clusters in early description flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught and thins under pressure. No loops, scaffold, or paraphrase stacks; pronoun and action order clean. High-band gate missed only because figurative language remains thick relative to slim beat count.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: pacifist lock-picking via sympathetic resonance, grief archived as silence taxonomy. Concept feels inevitable yet non-obvious; no trope echo. Risk resides in lyric stasis, but closure justifies stillness. Could edge higher with sharper external consequence.</comment>
