<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elar’s copper-veined body and quiet articulation are embodied in every beat; the ache of loss glows in his veins and drives the final endurance. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic, and the cost of the curse is felt in his flaring skin. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A; the self-conflict is sufficient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon becomes a living archive, the language’s death transmuted into eternal resonance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each echo layer births the new symphony—and the flawed diamond’s cost is visible in its dimmed glow. Orientation is immediate; the tunnel’s geography is never in doubt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon’s bone towers, mineral dew, and acoustic strata are selective, tactile, and directly shape the ritual. The tunnel itself functions as micro-setting that constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is urgent: grit, silk, hum guide the translation process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the death of a textured language—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened through each echo. Escalation is driven by Elar’s agency: aligning diamond with flock to transmute loss into resonance. The price is the diamond’s curse and the last elder’s silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the immortality of sensation over sound, the cost of preservation. The final image of the canyon singing textures offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moral is stated; ambiguity lingers in the curse’s survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and vibration. Syntax mirrors the layered echoes; no head-hopping. Compression is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sound, texture, and motion. No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the flock’s spiral, then settles into the final sustained chord.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of linguistic death, acoustic alchemy, and cursed geology feels inevitable and fresh. The texture-to-sound translation is a non-obvious synthesis that deepens on reflection. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
