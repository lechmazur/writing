<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling hands, the ring’s weight as anchor—yet the “tender shadow keeper” label is repeated rather than dramatized, and the companion’s interior state is ventriloquized without on-page contradiction. The final choice to release the ring is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the companion’s first free breath reweights the entire severance arc. The causal lens holds—each bridge burned is a deliberate surgical act whose cost is paid in the final image. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The charcoal sanctuary, starlight, and ring are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; the ring constrains the final choice by its weight and warmth. Micro-setting (her palm scars) charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching the suffocating to breathe via forced solitude—is signaled early and tightened once through the ring-link. The cost is legible in the companion’s shuddering breath and Elara’s relinquishment of the ring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of severance as pedagogy; the final image of the companion inhaling alone reconfigures the meaning of “burning bridges” without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature; lyric compression is consistent and taught early. No head-hopping; the companion’s gasp is filtered through the ring’s vision, not omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“anchor in the void,” “starlight’s cold watch”) are precise and purposeful; no mixed vehicles or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—using deliberate severance as a healing pedagogy—is fresh and grounded in specific lived detail. The ring-scar link feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (no on-page companion) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
