<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s contradictory impulses—feral instinct vs. ordered guardian—are embodied in every beat; the final choice to wear the pendant crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. One minor slip: “dimensionally homesick” leans label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s acceptance reweights her exile into agency. Causal chain from lost pendant → garden exile → retrieval → integration holds cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; garden and timeline anchor by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden’s thorns, mist, and iced soil constrain movement and mirror internal frost; the pendant’s gleam becomes the charged object that thaws perception. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridge dimensional exile—tightens once when waiting flips to active integration. Pendant retrieval is the decisive beat that narrows options from passive vigil to embodied acceptance. Cost is the garden’s chill etched into her mind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of boundaries (light/dark, exile/home) without direct statement; final image of mist parting offers non-literal resonance. Ambiguity lingers: uncertainty becomes ally, not enemy. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric close to Elowen’s senses; perceptual signature is consistent (“spectral fingers,” “crystalline patterns”). No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during pounce, longer cadences during reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves pattern (“thorns etched,” “lanterns in the haze”) without overwriting. No loops or scaffold. One strained metaphor—“roots into the void”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: feline librarian in dimensional exile garden. Pendant as both MacGuffin and metaphor for boundary negotiation feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode pays off; no derivative echoes.</comment>
