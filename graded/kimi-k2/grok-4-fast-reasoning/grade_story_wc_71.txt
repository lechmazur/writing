<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's quiet vigilance is concrete—his fingers brushing the orris shard, the scrape of chair legs—but the "inadvertently profound" label is unearned self-diagnosis rather than dramatized contradiction. Interiority stays selective and embodied; still, the final stance crystallizes more by authorial assertion than by a last micro-choice that costs him something we can see withheld.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cottage's new glow and ajar door reweight the earlier hush with undeniable conceptual cost—Elias's guardianship now has no endpoint. Causal linkage holds; each repositioned object is a because/therefore step that makes the final image legible. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bay, cottage, and orris shard each filter through Elias's sensorium; the violet-earth scent merging with briny air constrains his ritual and charges the final breath outward. Spatial choreography is immaculate—toy by window, chairs circling hearth. Weather and cracked panes remain steady; no white-room gaps. The shard-as-micro-setting meets the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—why some houses die—signals early; escalation is the tightening of silence inside one room, reversed when each displaced object reclaims its seat, narrowing retreat options for Elias. Cost is felt: the cottage claims him as caretaker, door left ajar forever. No coincidence; every creak is earned under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges via tactile ritual: memory fixed by scent, life fixed by arrangement—no thesis states it. The orris shard’s reprise on the mantel reweights "hollow shell" into "quiet blaze," inviting reflection on impermanence without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will other houses call?—and complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s hush-attuned gaze; perceptual signature vivid in "streetlights daydream" and "violet-heart" scent. Syntax breathes—long sentences for drift, clipped fragments for creaks. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulation under pressure is precise, rhythmic, and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences perform multiple jobs without scaffold. Figurative layer is dense but taught early ("streetlights daydream") and paid off at closure. No mixed metaphors, no synonym loops. Occasional elevated phrase ("profound silence that lingers") nudges toward purple yet stays within POV lexicon of quiet mystic. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar motif—lonely wanderer revives dead space—is re-angled through perfume chemistry and object choreography, making restoration tactile rather than sentimental. Specificity of orris-root violet-heart freshens the trope. Risk lies in lyric stillness over plot, but coherence holds. Not radically new, yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
