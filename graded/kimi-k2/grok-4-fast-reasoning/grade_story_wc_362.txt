<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath fogging the glass, the prism warming with her tears—but the “truthful lies” epiphany is delivered as label-speak rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds; the prism’s shift from passive vessel to active mirror of her own regret lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is Accumulative/Textural, tightening once when frost re-forms into her sister’s face.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist, quartz glow, and frost patterns are selective and purposeful, guiding her gaze and constraining her ritual. The arbor’s beacon-like presence charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—tightens when the frost reveals her own buried guilt, forcing a micro-choice of apology. Cost is felt (tears warm the prism), though the external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection emerges organically through the prism’s reversal: what she sought to prove in the world she must first accept in herself. Subtext of forgiveness is carried by the frost’s softening arms, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is consistent, rhythmic, and character-specific (“quartz tears,” “lacework of frost”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean and textured, with purposeful repetition (“mist,” “prism,” “frost”) that accumulates meaning. One mixed metaphor (“wept quartz tears”) is minor; no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar premise—objects holding emotions—is refreshed by the inversion that the mystic’s own feelings are the true source. Specificity of urban garden, heirloom prism, and frost ritual anchors the concept.</comment>
