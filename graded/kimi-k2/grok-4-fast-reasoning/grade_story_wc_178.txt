<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s frugality and star-fixed devotion stay consistent; the tile discovery and schematic mapping feel motive-driven. Interiority is dense, sometimes drifting into abstract lyric rather than embodied moment, muting contradictory impulse. Covenant whisper is earned, but change is more cosmic confirmation than personal cost—still, the stance crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: tile find → alignments → charged poise. Orientation anchored by 60-word mark; palace, dusk, regime limbo all legible. Closure is Charged Poise—tile pulses, stars witness, covenant sealed; cost is existential exposure, visible in final line “forever altered.” No causality breaks, one schematic transition cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Palace wing, frieze rubble, observatory nook, lantern flicker—selective, tactile, filtered through Elias’s lens. Dust, clay, parchment, nebula void supply micro-settings that constrain his movements and mirror interior void. “Dusky harmony” risks repetition but modulates with twilight shift, culminating in tile-lit stones. Spatial choreography tight; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: seal covenant with cosmos before regimes erase his work. Pressure escalates via each alignment beat—tile glow intensifies, void nebula mapped, fresco gods invoked—culminating in uncloathing. No antagonist needed; regime uncertainty supplies exterior clock. Cost is exposure/irreversibility, felt when tile dims and leaves him “forever altered”; options narrow to lifelong vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme: empirical precision vs. unknowable design. Emerges through tile’s perfect math mocking telescope proofs, final void brimming with unseen energy. Avoids overt thesis; resonance sits in tile’s dim return, stars as sole witnesses. Subtext of scholar’s encrypted faith rewarded without moralizing—ambiguity intact, but epiphany leans abstract rather than viscerally re-priced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature skews to angles, clay dust, star geometry. Syntax lengthens with contemplation, shortens under tile glow—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. Free indirect cleanly handled: “His frugal hands trembled slightly…” No dialogue, hence no voice drift; diction stays within scholar’s lexicon. Patterned repetition (“empirically ironic”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify, paragraphs breathe. High density—star geometry, void energy, devotional sigils layered without scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“covenant with the unknown,” “formless yet beckoning”) flirts with grandeur but stays motive-consistent. No loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks; tile’s pulse image remains clear through close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Babylonian star lore, magic square, and void cosmology feels fresh, not checklist. “Empirically ironic” as refrain transforms from wry observation to ontological rupture—earned reweighting. Risk in lyric abstractions pays off via tile’s final dim. Could swap era or locale, but square-to-constellation mapping is specific enough to resist full transplantation.</comment>
