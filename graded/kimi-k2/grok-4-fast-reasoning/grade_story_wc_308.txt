<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s centuries-long endurance and the embodied harmonics in her veins give her a singular, weathered interiority; the final press of the arrowhead to her forehead crystallizes her earned renunciation of physical wandering, sealing the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the arrowhead’s pulse fuses with her own, granting unmoving navigation while foreclosing bodily travel; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the murmuration’s final arrow shape reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and dust-choked wind are never mere backdrop; their echoes literally amplify the birds’ flight patterns, constraining how Elara reads fate and charging the final image of rooted omnipresence.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—mastery of unmoving navigation—tightens when the starlings veer into an arrow, forcing Elara’s decisive fusion with the relic; the cost is the permanent surrender of corporeal roaming.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The theme of stillness-as-mobility emerges through the arrowhead’s heartbeat and the canyon’s layered dust, culminating in a resonant, non-verbal image of a body rooted yet spiritually unbound.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lyric, textured prose mirrors Elara’s ancient patience; selective sensory focus (dust, pulse, wing-shadow) stays within her perceptual signature, and the rhythmic crescendo of “wander no more” lands with deliberate cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Every sentence carries dual freight—image and motion—without loops; “shadows danced across the bone spires, mimicking the arrowhead’s etchings” fuses setting, object, and fate in one breath.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of stone-skimming harmonics, bone-tower acoustics, and avian cartography feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; the risk of a centuries-old guardian achieving omnipresence without movement pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
