<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s “sanely eccentric” flourish is convincing and embodied (footnote-hoarding, silk ritual) and her private quest gates the climax; yet interiority stays safe, lacking jagged contradiction under peak visual rapture—credibly idiosyncratic, not transformative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elara’s hyperbolic schematic materializes a hyperbolic garden of stories, reconfiguring her prior search into visible conceptual cost (“the eternal archive”). Causality holds under an Accumulative lens; earlier footnote → silk → geometry → reawakening all feed the final image without slack.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Scientific-poetry library as micro-setting constrains acoustics and book placement in the key reawakening beat; scarf and geometry manifest via table-top lamplight, charging the final image. Specific, selective details anchor pressure without static exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—locating “where stories live”—drives Elara’s midpoint geometry sketch, but stakes never tighten beyond personal discovery; pressure plateaus rather than compels a higher-cost trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: analog memories as physical imprints vs digital ephemera. The ending reframes memory ownership without moralizing, letting the garden image carry conceptual repricing and social cost of lost tangible past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited prose maintains a lyrical, measured rhythm that modulates with discovery; voice filters notice through scientific metaphor (“non-Euclidean sea”) without drifting from Elara’s lexicon, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rich sensory density balanced with compression; rhythmic control tightens in the scarf-reawakening beat. Minor filter-verb clusters and occasional “equation-danced” figurative layering dull immediety but don’t obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The story synthesizes a familiar quest into a fresh arc—scientist-librarian using hyperbolic math to reawaken analog memories—achieved through specific grounded choices rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
