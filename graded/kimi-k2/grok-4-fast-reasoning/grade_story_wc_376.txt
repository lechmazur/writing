<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—recovering vanished candor—drives every move; her evolving interiority under pressure is concrete (“her gilded leaves vibrant once more” shows earned change). The lie-sensing gift is dramatized twice with visible cost (brown curling, Kael’s exposure), anchoring agency. Missing: micro-choice beat inside the Vault that would crystallize internal contradiction at peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she finds map → therefore tunnels → therefore Vault → therefore returns transformed. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (“ready to inscribe these recovered conversations”) that forecloses her former complacency. Orientation is clean within 120 words; transitions are smooth; only minor slack: Kael’s threat is announced rather than tested in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fogged greenhouse ribs, yellow haze, zinc fragment’s cool weight—each detail filters through Elara’s tactile goal-directed handling. The map’s postal etchings and crystalline Vault constrain her path and final purpose. Environment reciprocally wilts or revives with honesty, charging closure. One micro-slip: “dripping conduits” generic amid stronger specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—recover lost candor—tightens when Kael’s lie browns the leaves, forcing subterranean risk. Vault entry is irreversible tactical narrowing; retrieved resonators foreclose former art-as-ornament path. Cost (physical descent, social defiance, exposure of Kael) legible on page. Could escalate further had Kael physically obstructed rather than only warned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of micro-truths as civic water emerges through action, not thesis: wilting leaves, crystalline confessions, final vow to irrigate souls. No moralizing—final image lets recovered farmer’s plea stand as resonant reconfiguration. Subtext in Kael’s jealous stance and browned edges implies larger corruption without speechifying. One soft echo: “small moments” iterated twice near end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensory filter; perceptual signature distinct (“gold-infused inks,” “toxic winds”). Syntax breathes with action, tightens in descent (“rusted grates and dripping conduits”). No dialogue until Kael’s terse warning—idiom fits apprentice-mentor tension, carries subtext of covetousness. Register stable; minor cadence repetition in “honest glances and admissions.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences perform double duty (action + world). No scaffold loops; mixed metaphors absent. High information density yet clarity maintained. Only micro-overwrite: “desiccated skins of forgotten fruits” slightly strains visual coherence in already humid space—minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Gilded-botanical lie-detector plus postal archaeology fused into fresh conceit; reversal that candor is literal crop feels inevitable after setup. Greenhouse under toxic sky not new, but here it mirrors moral atmosphere and leaf response, transcending postcard. Risky Vault descent pays off with crystalline voices, avoiding typical treasure payoff. Could edge higher if oasis myth were less familiar framework.</comment>
