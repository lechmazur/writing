<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s “intergenerational support” drive is dramatized through the relay of food runs; the bell-handoff micro-choice shows embodied cost. Interiority stays concrete (“her heart swelling with the motivation that had sustained her”) without label-speak. Status shift is subtle but legible when the youth corrects Elara’s caution, proving elders→youth transfer. Earned stasis lands: she accepts the risk in real time, not afterthought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s single toll turns anonymity into formal alliance, cost visible in the shared breath-hold that follows. Accumulative lens holds—each midnight donation adds density until the public vow crystallizes. Orientation clean: ridge/valley/curfew anchors arrive by line 5. No causal breaks; the declaration grows organically from prior relay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains: the exposed ridge forces nocturnal secrecy and the vine-wrapped beam provides the only bell anchor. Sensory triage (“baked red,” “rusted breaths”) mirrors embargo pressure without excess. Spatial track clean: drone distance vs. footfall audibility stays consistent. Bell’s patina recharges homeland loss in final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival vs. tightening patrol—tightens when drone sweeps foreclose daylight options, pushing runs to midnight. One meaningful deepening: anonymous relay → formal pact, narrowing safety to collective exposure. Price legible: pact increases visibility, acknowledged on-page (“risks mounted—drones swept closer”). Agency sits with Elara’s declaration, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of inherited resilience emerges from the relay pattern itself; no character sermonizes. Final bell toll reweights earlier “forgotten promises” into living covenant. Ambiguity persists: new visibility may doom them, yet the vow stands. No thesis line—image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers at Elara’s shoulder, filtering perception through “parched earth” and “rationed breaths.” Syntax lengthens in calm, compresses at runner’s approach, matching pulse. No head-hop; collective “they” at end is external summary, not POV breach. Bell’s “patina whispering” is允许的figurative overlay consistent with her nostalgia.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative layer (“fog,” “ghosts,” “forgotten promises”) stays coherent under embargo conceit. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. High-density line: “anonymous donations slipping through the shadows like ghosts with full baskets” delivers sensory, emotional, and plot data in one breath.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sanction-survival tales abound, yet the generational relay formalized by a single bell toll feels fresh. Bell’s transformation from nostalgic relic to covenant seal is inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken: almost no exposition of outside world, keeping focus on hush and relay. Specific valley botany (hidden potato plots) roots the premise.</comment>
