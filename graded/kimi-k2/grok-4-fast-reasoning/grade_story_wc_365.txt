<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s cyclically spontaneous intuition drives every pivot; the withheld-truth motive threads through her micro-choices, and her renunciation at the end lands as earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single causal thread held: shard acts as nexus → parallel weave → mentor exile → renunciation. Closure achieves conceptual repricing that reweights multiverse stakes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (body-tool-environment) constrains each beat: cold bay metal, humming shard, orbital geometry—all pressure tactics. Density-driven lyric elision taught early, coherent at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the weight of truth—escalates via each parallel crash; each redirect tightens option space and ends in a foreclosure choice with an anchor’s gravity as paid price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from accumulated cost: each weft adds cosmic burden; final realization reframes mentor’s exile and Elara’s mapping ethics. Resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—tactile, synesthetic—and rhythmic control under pressure; patterned metaphors (neural pathways, anchors) taught and paid off in the ending image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>High information density, no loops; figurative language kept selective, never obscures cause/effect; sentence-level propulsion matches scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes portal-fantasy and memory guilt into a fresh, specific emotional calculus; mentor’s self-exile as foil and Elara’s refusal feel inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
