<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s decisive kindness and clear goal to craft a flawless goodbye materially shape every beat: her choice to invoke the vinyl shard and guide the duet is a micro-turn that forecloses Elena’s isolation. Interiority stays concrete, devoid of therapy-speak, and her endurance carries visible emotional cost in the final image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One continuous scene within the hospice room; causality hinges on Elara’s hymning choices narrowing Elena's options toward reconnection.

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The mist-locked peaks and cloud vapors are not mere backdrop; the wild-jasmine scent drifting upward becomes an active constraint that coaxes hope’s presence into the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent as the setting guides quiet resource—the open window channels the fragrance that charges Elara’s last note.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: execute a flawless reconnection. Pressure tightens after the blood-work refutation, narrowing Elena’s trajectory. The closing embrace crystallizes stakes, and the broken vinyl—once source of rupture—now seals the goodbye at visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: mundane moments re-stitched into sacred farewell. Subtext lives in the vinyl fragment’s reweighted meaning and the scent of hope reconfiguring regret. The final image—mother and daughter over the shard—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Subtle, consistent third-person limited in Elara’s selective perception—e.g., scent of wild jasmine noticed only when it serves her tactic. Rhythm under pressure tightens as the hymn crescendos into the farewell moment. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext when Elena whispers her regret back.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is concise with visible momentum: “the pulsing stillness that defined this radiant haven” conveys tone without purple drift. Rhythm mirrors breath as cloud vapors and guitar strums sync. Sensory specificity—“scent of hope, faint but unmistakable like wild jasmine”—anchors the motif without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The hymning of mundane joys into farewell song feels fresh: stitching kitchen-table sunlight and kettle whistles into healing. Yet the scaffold—serene hospice, misty peaks—carries familiar hospice imagery. The vinyl shard’s transformation from fracture to bridge provides the memorable inflection.</comment>
