<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is concrete—she pockets the grain, rigs the chem-lab, keeps the vigil—every beat springs from that trait. Interiority stays sensory (“heart ached with dawnlit melancholy”), never diagnostic. The final endurance costs her body and future access to the summit, so renunciation is earned. Only minor flaw: the “precious” refrain flirts with label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the stake of vanishing quiet. The hourglass grain → chem-message → final spectral projection is a taught pattern that reweights meaning at closure. Orientation is secured within 50 words; geography never drifts. Cost is legible in the last frame: she descends, summit scheduled for rockets, photo the lone salvage—Earned Stasis complete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Frost-laced regolith, frayed tether, phosphor vial—every tool body-anchors choice. The moonlit summit constrains camera angle, suit seals, and the ticking cold that drives the chem reaction. Micro-setting (grain inside vial) powers the final hologram, charging the closing image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV: inspector notices fracture lines before starfield.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“last dawning hush”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens as sunlight encroaches. The chemical timer and summit cold escalate risk, forcing her to outlast fatigue to secure the shot; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening: spectral nightwatch warns “preserve the precious,” crystallizing her stance. Cost visible in frozen seals and forfeited future access.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from objects: hourglass relic vs. laser grids—time measurement overwritten by automation. Final image reweights prior tech-catalogue as loss, not progress. No moralizing; resonance lives in the archival frame. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation act futile? Complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, filtering every noun through inspector’s professional eye: “ejecta,” “regolith,” “phosphors.” Rhythms lengthen under melancholy, compress under fatigue: “soft tick of her suit’s life-support.” No head-hop; visor POV stays locked. Technical lexicon stays credible and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm breathes with scene tempo; varied sentence fronts avoid drumbeat. Information density high—single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“Moonlight bathed the expansive bowl below in silvery melancholy, shadows pooling like forgotten dreams”). One mixed metaphor—”lattice of outposts and laser grids”—slight blur, but closure line is clean. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lunar inspector photographing silence is fresh; hourglass grain as memory capsule re-ignites antique tech within near-future setting. Risk: lyric accumulative structure could feel familiar, yet specificity of chem-reaction timer and holographic nightwatch reconfigures trope. Transformation test passes—story fails without lunar cold and vacuum rules. Voice fusion of hard-SF detail with melancholic cadence distinctive.</comment>
