<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—defeatist elegist vs. visionary myth-maker—co-exist in the same beats; the shard-etching micro-choice visibly forecloses scholarly purity and costs him his last claim to militant truth, earning a credible renunciation. Interiority stays concrete (“burnished sorrow,” “polished grief”) and avoids label-speak. The small circle of skeptics functions as status mirror: their shift from weary dismissal to tentative hope externalizes the stakes. Motive progression is steady: grief → shard-as-tool → invented myth → revolutionary rebirth, each step causally tethered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the scholarly dispute is not solved but rendered irrelevant by a collectively accepted myth, paid for by Elias’s forfeiture of empirical certainty (“sorrow burnished, but never extinguished”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each inscription and veil adds density until the storm’s spectacle re-weights the colony’s origin story. Causality is tight—no prop or timeline jump is unmotivated. Early orientation is swift: Elysium Prime, post-Unveiling, Elias the defunct, all within first 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid is not postcard backdrop; the filigreed spires and chronal mists literally supply the ritual space and refractive medium Elias needs. The shard acts as micro-setting that constrains his gesture count—one slip and the myth cracks. Sensory hierarchy follows a poet’s bias: sight and touch dominate, sound is distant lament. Spatial choreography is clean; mirrors, vaults, salon are tracked without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the paralysis of cultural memory—tightens when Elias’s devise transforms defensive superstition into generative myth, foreclosing the empirical path. One meaningful escalation: storm → shard-inscribed veil → unified vision; cost is the scholarly faction’s epistemic surrender. Agency is his alone; coincidence merely supplies the storm he weaponizes. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—history as negotiable poetry—emerges through refracted light and woven silk, never stated. Subtext pulses in the final line: “sorrow burnished, but never extinguished,” implying myths polish pain without healing it. No moral is pronounced; the people’s gleaming eyes carry the ambiguous triumph. The shard’s shift from relic to stylus reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias’s elegiac idiom; perceptual signature is mournfully ornamental (“spires … like frozen screams”). Syntax elongates then compresses under storm pressure, mirroring temporal spasms. No head-hopping; the skeptics’ interiority is implied only through gesture. Register remains poet-philosopher without purple drift—diction earned by established character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from languid cadence to staccato shard-scraps during inscription. Metaphors are baroque but internally coherent; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold paraphrase loop (“burnished sorrow” appears twice) costs −0.2. Otherwise sentences carry double duty—description advances mythopoeic argument. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fusion of visible time, mirror ritual, and archaeological stalemate feels fresh; the shard-stylus reframes familiar trope of “rebel propaganda” into ontological craftsmanship. Risk—letting consensus reality overwrite empirical truth—is committed to without flinching. Specificity of filigreed asteroid and chronal storms prevents generic transplant. Transformation test fails: swap setting or object and the entire conceit collapses.</comment>
