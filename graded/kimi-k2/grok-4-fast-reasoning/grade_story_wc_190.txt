<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet caretaker persona is consistent, but his interiority stays largely abstract; the single moment of embodied change—Lira’s shoulders easing—lands, yet his own emotional cost remains off-stage, softening the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush itself becomes the earned balm. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early and the final image reweights the premise with quiet, visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is rendered through selective, sensory strokes—prisms humming underfoot, mist tasting of rain-kissed stone—that constrain movement and mood. The drifting terrace and gondola act as micro-settings shaping every tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether silence can be transmuted into comfort; pressure tightens once when the aether-wind approaches and Elias deploys the vial. The cost is atmospheric rather than material, but it is legible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as craftable solace. No moral is stated; the final whispered gratitude lets the idea resonate without abstraction, though the thematic edge could have cut deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is strong—Elias notices air-pulse and prism-hum before speech. Occasional ornate phrasing (“vaulting hush unto itself”) edges toward purple but stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic, with only minor loops (“vaulting hush” twice in close proximity). Metaphors cohere; no line-level artifact obscures the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>The aerial gondola-as-therapy conceit feels fresh, and the storm-glass adaptation from sea to sky is a pleasing inflection. Yet the emotional arc treads familiar quiet-grief territory, muting full originality.</comment>
