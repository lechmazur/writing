<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fingers trembling, muscle memory guiding the buckle—yet the contradictory impulses (doubt vs duty) are stated more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of doubt is credible but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the updated log reweights the colony’s options and the “trust intact” beat carries visible social cost. Causal chain from static clearing → anomaly sighting → revision → transmission is clean and held under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arbor’s sway, solar-fabric leaves, and parachute-buckle micro-setting constrain every move; the cold buckle metal and harness tension are tactile anchors that charge the final re-clip. Spatial choreography is precise; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve trust under pressure”—is signaled early and tightened once when the spiral anomaly forces a live revision that forecloses the prior benign reading. Agency is decision, not coincidence; cost is the perpetual return of the watcher’s burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust-as-survival emerges through action and image rather than statement; the final “soundless echo” reweights the opening silence into a charged poise. Avoids moralizing, but the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature—“fog-shrouded gales,” “vine-wrapped conduits”—with rhythmic compression under stress. No head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt the burden deepen”) and one paraphrase loop (“soundless echo” thrice) keep it from 9.0. Metaphors are coherent and serve pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-colony vigilante and tactile tool-use; the parachute-buckle-as-tool twist feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Avoids genre clichés, though the “ancient bio-steel arbor” edges toward familiar imagery.</comment>
