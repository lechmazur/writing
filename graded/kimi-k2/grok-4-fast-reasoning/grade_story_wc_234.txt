<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority pulses—her fingers “tracing the curl’s smooth arc” while pocket-suns itch for release—yet Thorne’s cartographer identity never presses a single concrete choice; his confession lands as summary, not crucible. The earned shift is hers alone, costing her a vial and risking the relic, so friendship’s re-valuation feels credible but lopsided.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the glowing shell re-weights their shared rule-set under a Hybrid lens (accumulative image + causal infusion). Anchors arrive by line 5; the Orientation Test is waived because late disorientation pays off in the final image. One minor causality bump: “gathered fragments of resolve” is told, not shown, softening the cost ledger a hair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus is not backdrop but furnace—“molten veins pulsing beneath the earth” constrain how close they can kneel, how fast the shell warms. Twilight’s color spectrum is filtered through Elara’s alchemist eye, converging on the final star-lit hum of the transformed shell. Micro-setting triumph: the pocket-sun vial’s glass thickness dictates the moment the cork can be safely cracked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renegotiate the friendship’s symbolic debt—tightens when the shell’s cage-function is named; the infusion act forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each ember pop adds sensory density until the columella’s glow crystallizes the new pact. Cost is legible—loss of one irreproducible vial—but because Thorne’s stakes are summarized, the felt price skews one-sided.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges as “return differently” = reprice relics rather than discard them, shown through the shell’s re-lit spiral. Subtext lives in gesture: the shell passes from his palm to hers exactly as blame is quietly reassigned. No moralizing coda—final image of intertwined futures is oblique, resonant, charged with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person free indirect clings to Elara’s scientifically romantic percept—light measured as “density of presence,” warmth as “solar essence.” Syntax flexes with heat: clauses elongate during alchemical hesitation, then snap to verb-driven pulses at ignition. No head-hop; Thorne’s interior access is filtered through her reading of his “scientifically romantic gleam,” maintaining distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythmic propulsion carries long yet breathable sentences; only one paraphrase loop (“resolve’s palette colored their path ahead” echoes earlier palette line) costs −0.2. Figurative layering is high but patterned—light/fire/shell spiral—teaching its recursion early, paying off in the closing hum. No register drift or mixed metaphor; closure image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fusion of astrophysical alchemy with conch geometry feels fresh, not checklist; the pocket-sun vial miniaturizes stellar force without technobabble. “Return differently” reframes nostalgia as firmware update rather than erasure, a non-obvious angle on reconciliation. Risk is moderate—lyric density borders on purple but holds under Accumulative lens.</comment>
