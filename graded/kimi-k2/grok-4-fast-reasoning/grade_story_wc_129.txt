<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is precise—her longing bruised by the orchard’s exclusion is embodied in the hum of the fruit-lanterns—and her final sculptural act crystallizes her integration (cost: solitude). Small scout: her “bold sympathy” label is flat in the last paragraph. Character arcs cleanly without slips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single causal chain from first orchard dusk → shared search → crater descent → arbor dedication, all under a tight situational lens. Closure leverages Charged Poise: the arbor glows with new kinship cost. Minor bump: orientation anchor drifts at the 200-word mark before the crater scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is instrumental: crystalline vines literally tighten the search path, and the crater’s shimmer refracts the final tag. The obsidian arbor constrains the final ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>One escalating dominant stake—belonging—tightens via each shard of the search; the obsidian tag emerges forcing a public stance. Coincidence does not resolve; pressure crystallizes at the arbor. Hiccup: causal link between Lir’s lore and Elara’s integration is slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Webs of kinship emerge organically through action (shared search → communal dedication). Final arbor dedication reframes kinship as ongoing endurance of lost language—a non-literal answer felt in the luminescent ache. No sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single close third, percual signature: reeds “itch” and the orchard “whispers” in ways only reed-sculptor could notice. No head-hopping in the brief ensemble sequences. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Purposeful compression, no loops. One metaphor drift: “luminescent ache” is lovely once, slightly strained on repetition yet does not obscure cause/effect. Read-aloud rhythm holds to the final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh intersection: marsh-reed sculptor + crystalline orchard + lost-language tag reweights the familiar outsider-joins-community arc. Specific object (obsidian arbor as kinship monument) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
