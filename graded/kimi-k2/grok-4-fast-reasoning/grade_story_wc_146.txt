<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s drive is clear and her patience is dramatized through stillness and micro-gestures, but she never makes a costly choice; the entire beat sequence is observation and gentle guidance. No contradiction or visible flaw complicates her stance, so the “earned” quality stays theoretical. Interiority is atmospheric rather than specific, and the single on-page farmer, Thorne, is a cardboard herald, not pressure. Closure is collective, not personal, so her arc remains flat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archway’s faint peal reconfigures possibility with undeniable conceptual cost—collapse is still imminent, but communal rhythm now carries the price of continued effort. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each footstep accretes density until the bells answer. Orientation is clear by word 60. No tightening beat narrows Elowen’s own options, so the cost is communal, not protagonist-specific; this caps the score below 8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Archway, fork, and cobblestones work as micro-setting that literally channels vibration into revival; spatial choreography is clean. Wild-hush twilight is evoked through sound, not sight, matching the ear-centric premise. Weather and era stay vague, but specificity arrives via tactile stone and tuning-fork wood, enough to constrain the footstep method. Setting directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent final silence—is signaled early and escalates as footsteps thicken the hum; however, no individual faces a trade-off or loss. Pressure is ambient, not protagonist-bound; the “collapse” remains an abstract horizon. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archway trembles, but options for Elowen do not narrow. Cost is felt collectively, not dramatized on-page as a sacrifice or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal resonance emerges through iterated footfall/chime imagery rather than statement; no moral is pronounced. Subtext resides in the shift from solitary tuner to polyphonic tread, implying shared burden. Ambiguity is preserved: revival may still fail. Final image reweights earlier silence without sermons, but the insight stays lightly anchored because no character internalizes the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-limited clings to Elowen’s sensorium: obsidian eyes, callused palms, vibration up forearms. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the tuning-fork hum, creating a sonic prose mirror. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Diction edges toward the ornate but stays within a mythic register the piece teaches early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is deliberate and cadenced, emulating bell resonance; occasional adjective stacks (“weathered stones, carved with runes that seemed to pulse faintly”) flirt with purple but serve the acoustic texture. No paraphrase loops; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“heartbeat long dormant” applied to stone hum—barely blurs clarity. Closure line is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar “mystic guardian revives dead town” arc is re-angled through acoustic engineering: revival via footstep-tuned infrasound. Mythic diction and sound-as-building-material feel specific to this piece. Risk is moderate—no structural gimmicks, but the sonic premise is pursued with conviction. Without the exact fork/cobble/bell system the story evaporates, giving it moderate irreplaceability.</comment>
