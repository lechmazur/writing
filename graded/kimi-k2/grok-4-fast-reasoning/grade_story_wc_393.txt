<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and need to “turn apology into action” are concrete and embodied in the handing-over of the box; the micro-choice to ask Thorne to “tell me about him” exposes fresh risk. Interiority stays specific to a chaplain’s register (“unspoken apology,” “hurried prayers”) and avoids label-speak. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene—he never wavers or faces a live fork—so the arc is emotional accumulation rather than earned turn; cost is asserted, not paid on page. Thorne’s backstory is implied, not activated as pressure, keeping relationship crucible latent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restarted clockwork heart reweights Elias’s guilt into forward obligation with visible cost (the long drive to the daughter now inevitable). Causal lens holds: because Thorne repairs the heart, therefore Elias’s stance crystallizes. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation is taught later, so no penalty. The single meaningful tightening—the gear catching and the sun-shaft revelation—occurs exactly at the climax; earlier beats accumulate texture rather than narrow options, satisfying short-form escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Shop is rendered through sensory triage—dust motes, whirring cams, oil-drop gleam—each filtering Elias’s clerical eye for sacramental stillness. The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting: its brass veins constrain Thorne’s gestures and literally house the stakes. Spatial track is clean: door-bell → workbench → light beam across bench. Weather break at climax is signaled early by storm rumble, then pays off as the ray that charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to convert regret into restorative act—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened once: the heartbeat resumes, making the trip to the daughter unavoidable. Pressure is coherent but external: the repair succeeds without Elias risking failure or resource; he watches rather than acts. Cost is conceptual (duty accepted) rather than visceral; price is legible but not dramatized as forfeiture. Sufficient for short-form; reaches high band but not 8.8 without an on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “second opinions on worth” emerges through the heart’s revival rather than sermon; Thorne’s single-word line “Deserve” crystallizes it without moralizing. Harlan’s lullaby and the daughter never seen again reprice the abstract word “deserve” into lived consequence. Final sun-shaft image offers non-literal answer: redemption is mechanical yet fragile, never proclaimed. No final-paragraph thesis statement; avoids echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: “his collar a subtle reminder,” “the calm before realization settling over him.” Diction is priest-leaning—“penitentiary,” “sacramental hush”—without register drift. Thorne’s dialogue is terse, artisanal, distinct from Elias’s clerical cadence; no convergence under stress. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences in reflective beats, clipped fragments during gear catch, supporting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry double duty—setting, emotion, metaphor—without scaffold: “dust motes danced in slanted beams, evoking the quiet energy of forgotten melodies.” Figurative density is high but patterned early (“vibrant hush” taught in line 2) and pays off at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; occasional adjective stacks (“tiny mechanical marvel pulsing with brass veins”) stay within POV. Clean mechanics; pronoun and tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clockwork heart as engine of absolution is fresh angle on prison-redemption trope; specificity of music-box repair shop and chaplain POV prevents generic overlay. Thorne’s possible ex-con past is hinted, not exploited for twist, avoiding gimmick. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence justifies choice. Could swap Harlan’s crime to drug offense without breaking arc, so transformation is partial.</comment>
