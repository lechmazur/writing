<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s synesthetic trauma, tactile forge-work, and final micro-choice (“slipped the hearing aid into place”) embody a credible internal arc. Motive (“find the sound of trust breaking”) is specific and drives every beat; the healing-body ticking clock adds bodily stakes. Interiority stays concrete (“heard violet as a fragile trill”) rather than diagnostic. No contradictory impulses appear in-scene, and the renunciation lands with felt cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the device hums alive, trust-fracture becomes “a faint, healing hum,” reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost. Causal chain—betrayal → absence gathering → imprint → new aurora-hearing—holds under the inferred Causal lens. Orientation is anchored inside 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: “cells divided” is invoked thrice but never alters tactics; it acts as decorative clock, not constraint, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse dome, rusted hulls, geothermal forge, and bioluminescent fruit form a tight sensory circuit; every object is handled (vial poured, forge pressed, mask donned). Aurora light filtering through cracked glass constrains the final imprint beat, meeting the 9+ gate. Selective detail (“ashen embers pulsed like a weary heartbeat”) keeps economy. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of absence”—is signaled early; agency narrows to the single imprint action that forecloses retreat. Pressure tightens once: the molten hiss crystallizes the fracture, price paid in tears (“tears mixed with the brine”). Accumulation of silences supplies motive but not escalating obstacles; therefore escalation is present yet slender. Cost is legible on-page, satisfying the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as forge, absence as material, resilience as artifact. No thesis statements; final “healing hum” reweights earlier fracture without moralizing. Subtext operates through sensory cross-talk (color-hears) and object reprise (forge, aurora). Ambiguity remains—trust is not restored, only transmuted—inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinct (“reds humming low like distant thunder”). Syntax mirrors pressure: longer clauses in calmer orchard walks, staccato prepositional bursts at the forge. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Compression (“trimming back mentally…”) is taught early and paid off at closure, legitimizing elision. Voice stays character-bound throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but purposeful—auroras “weaving like spectral threads” primes the finale. One coherence slip: “cells divided” metaphor risks mixed biological/mechanical metaphor when paired with forge, yet does not cloud causality. Information density high; every sentence advances image or beat. Minor paraphrase loop on “battered marvel” (×3) holds score sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic underwater luthiery is fresh; combines memory-forging, synesthesia, and sunken orchard without feeling stitched. The “collecting absences” mechanic is non-obvious and powers the climax. Specific detail (volcanic vent forge, barnacled hulls) prevents generic slip. Risk in lyrical compression is rewarded because closure remains legible.</comment>
