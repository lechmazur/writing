<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to “read scars” is concrete and embodied; every micro-choice (digging, pressing opal to skin) flows from the car-crash wound. Interiority keeps returning to bodily sensation, avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation—bandaging after vision—pays the cost of reopening grief, earned by the opal’s reveal. Only minor slip: the telepathy quirk is declared, not dramatized as contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the opal vision reframes survival from guilt to custodial miracle, cost paid in reopened tears and flowing hourglass. Causal chain—coffee rings → plant cue → tunnel → opal → scar vision—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by second sentence; no lens drift. Persistent constraint: frozen hourglass thaws only after acceptance, tightening the frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tower, garden soil, and quartz chamber are tactile and filtered through Elara’s wound-focused attention. Frosted hourglass operates as micro-setting that constrains time perception until final thaw. Spatial track clean: bed → spiral stair → garden → hollow. Light, dew, and root vibrations braid into emotional pressure without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she reopen the scar narrative or cauterize it—tightens when plants demand tunneling, foreclosing sterile closure. Agency drives every escalation: she digs, she presses stone, she decides to bandage. Cost legible: emotional wound reopened, hourglass re-started, solitude confirmed. No coincidence resolves; opal is buried consequence, not deus-ex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of “displaced miracle” emerges solely through image—scar, frozen sand, buried opal—never named in abstraction. Final reweighting: survival guilt becomes generative custodianship, resonating without moral. Coffee-ring divination and plant telepathy integrate as idiosyncratic lived magic rather than symbolic furniture. Ambiguity remains: miracle is neither cruel nor kind, simply rerouted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at intimate distance, syntax lengthening with anesthetic fog, compressing under opal shock. Metaphoric register (“meteor hush”) sustains throughout without purple drift. Perceptual signature scar-bound: light gilds stone only as it touches her wound. No head-hop; plant whispers filtered through her nerve-set.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, rhythm echoing breath of sedation clearing. No loops or scaffold; each line advances image or choice. Figurative language sparse, precise: “roots through cracked soil” carries both telepathy and grief. High density: hourglass, coffee rings, and scar converge in one tactile beat without crowding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Teleporting a grief-reading, plant-telepathic scar-excavator into a cliffside tower risks gimmick, yet every fantastical element grows from single car-crash seed. Coffee-ground divination repurposes grandmother lore as forensic grief-work, fresh. Risk-taking (frozen time, telepathic ferns) tightens rather than escapes stakes. Could swap opal for another heirloom, slight ding.</comment>
