<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s eccentricity and yearning feel lived-in, and her compass-born visions push her into decisive latent action. Interior contradiction surfaces when sensuous petrichor clashes with sterile limestone, grounding her arc. One clear turning beat (compass reading) earns a modest earned-stasis close.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the compass crystallizes her quest without resolving it, shifting her perception of mystery and cost. Causality holds as each beat narrows her options toward the lagoon. The inferred lens (Causal) is consistent with the final charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The limestone lagoon’s sensory details are wielded not as scenery but as pressure: damp heat, metallic scent, and mirror-still water constrain movement and amplify hush. Micro-setting (quartz psychometry tool) becomes tactile anchor and filter. Specific, purposeful specificity meets the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—piercing the veil where logic fails—is signalled early and tightened by the compass-vision. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass points inward rather than north. Felt cost is implicit in her solitary descent; escalation reads clean under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of mystery beyond explanation arises from concrete sensorial actions rather than assertion. Final image of dripping compass quietly reprices her lifelong quest, reweighting prior motifs. Avoids tidy moralizing; ambiguity remains legible yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person-limited voice is stable; psychometry framing is consistent, with sensory syntax compressing under weight of images. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays character-specific, earning a high-band mark.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive—high information ratio, rhythmic variety, zero loops. Figurative language is selective: “petrichor lingered like the earth itself remembered” anchors setting without overshadowing sense. Read-aloud test passes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar “vanished expedition” trope is revitalized through Elara’s eccentric lens and limestone-psychometry combination. Specific inflection—compass pointing inward—feels non-obvious and earned. Risky lyric hush heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Her petrichor collecting is more than quirk: it frames her stance, fuels her descent, and chemically charges the final image. One key choice—accepting the compass’s pull—shapes the entire act. Irreplaceable trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Compass appears early (setup), guides descent (development), and spins wildly at finale pointing inward (payoff). Each beat reweights its meaning; removal would collapse story logic. Strong causality meets gate model.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The concept of “hinged awakenings” is dramatized through the compass’s literal pivot; one micro-turn signals deeper mythic reach. Specific causal pressure lifts it above mere echo, though concept could still sharpen.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>“Sensibly eccentric” constrains action: she packs vials and quartz despite obvious danger, a visible trade-off that shapes tactics. Label surfaces but also enforces choice—mid-band to high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Her deliberate descent into the fissure (“delve”) is dramatized across two beats and cannot be swapped without breaking causal flow. Drives momentum and tightens options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Psychometry positions one critical beat—compass reveals inner pull—but mechanics remain soft; method lightly shapes tactics without altering deeper rules. Mid-tier integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Limestone lagoon actively pressures choices: secluded space magnifies hush, cool damp air limits movement, and mirrors distort perception. Micro-setting earns its place throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Post-factory setting is convincing backdrop, yet time never tightens into a live clock constraining moves. Functional but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Motivation to find where logic fails is dramatized via fear and wonder; friction emerges when compass points inward, forcing renunciation of rational path. Desire is causally active and visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Resonant hush” modulates from atmospheric hush to final charged silence around dripping compass, shaping reader tone and closure image. Coherent and indispensable.</comment>
