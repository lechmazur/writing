<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle handler trait is embodied in tactile care; his interior contradiction (trust vs self-respect) is on page, but the decisive choice to report Mira is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, so the change feels lightly rather than forcibly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens clear: betrayal → ritual repair → resolved stance. Closure lands via Earned Stasis (“He would report Mira”) tied to tail’s regeneration image; cost is present yet compressed into one final line, slightly thinning impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Misty glass workshop, starlight, condensation, nutrient gel are filtered through Elias’s professional eye; the tail-as-micro-setting constrains his gestures and charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive by ~100 words; no orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity vs complicity—signalled early; pressure tightens when each “layer” of deceit is physically stripped while he works. Escalation is steady but single-thread; no second reversal, and external jeopardy (arrest, violence) stays off-stage, muting peak cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation after betrayal emerges organically from beats; tail regeneration mirrors personal repair without overt statement. Final image avoids moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity, though thematic wording (“balance self-respect…”) is stated in prompt-like diction once.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical, hushed third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensory filter; rhythm swells and contracts with his focus. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shimmering stillness,” “quietly vivid”) edges toward poetic formula but remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and generally concise; metaphor density is high but patterned to the nocturnal mood. Minor scaffold appears (“layer by layer,” “one layer at a time”) and one paraphrase loop (“fragile convictions… now gleamed with renewed purpose”) withholds full 9-band clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Smuggling-as-betrayal and tail-regeneration metaphor gives a fresh hinge on familiar eco-crime terrain; the regenerative ritual feels specific to this voice. Yet the plot arc (partner dupes gentle protagonist, who finds resolve) follows expected contours with limited surprise.</comment>
