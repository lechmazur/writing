<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory drive—borrowing personalities to map emotion—drives every beat; the final renunciation of formulaic empathy is earned by the prior collapse of her borrowed selves, with visible cost in the torn broadsheet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: inciting desire to quantify emotion → escalating experiments → decisive collapse of the premise. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts the storm of feeling, the cost legible in the shredded “Equations of the Heart.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Topaz walls, halo fragment, and vanishing stars are not backdrop but pressure: the fragment bends meaning, the dying sky times the final flicker, the workshop’s pulse mirrors her cardiac disorientation. Micro-setting (press, shard, ink) constrains every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can emotion be solved like math—tightens when transposed empathy backfires, forcing a stance shift. Escalation is causal: each borrowed personality increases internal turbulence until the equation fractures, price paid in relinquished certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges without statement: the futility of reducing human feeling to formula. The final image—torn ambiguous broadsheet—reweights the entire quest, offering a resonant, non-moral answer that lingers in the reader’s own emotional turbulence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually specific: “brooding intensity of a long-dead astronomer” felt in fingertips, “lucid turbulence” as sensory haze. No head-hopping; compression and patterned repetition serve the accumulative lens and are paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, rhythm modulating with pressure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“stars…like secrets unwilling to be told”) and never muddles causality. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial relic + printing press + emotional algebra. The conceit feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (quantified empathy) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—story collapses if any core element is swapped.</comment>
