<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—mapmaker who must chart the unseeable—lands early and steadies the arc; the platinum ring’s pulses force micro-adjustments that externalise her guilt. Interiority stays concrete (“skin prickled with absorbed phrases”) and avoids label-speak. The final absorption of “forgiveness” risks epiphany shorthand, but the prior trail of loss-memories pays for it. Cost is felt: silence after absorbed screams is permanently replaced by a live melody she must now carry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystalline pool re-weights her inner map; time exhales, trapping her in responsibility to chart this new territory. Causal chain holds: ring hum → dowse → note-trail → stillpoint absorption; no off-stage fixes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line ~60. Accumulation cap applies only to non-closure beats, none touch the final image. Cost is visible: “quiet blaze” endures—ongoing labor implied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest is more than backdrop—its high-frequency branches block visual norms and force tactile navigation, directly shaping method and stakes. Micro-setting rule met: the dowsing rod and ring serve as portable “rooms” that constrain every step. Sensory filtration stays blind-POV specific (“inaudible life,” “vibrations too high for most ears”). Spatial choreography clean; distance from alcove to clearing tracked via rod tremors. Detail economy tight—no climate clichés, no floating rooms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode her own grief or remain hollow—signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the melody layers guilt-memories. One meaningful deepening suffices: arrival at the pool forecloses retreat; absorption of forgiveness is irreversible. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens: notes stack into harmonies that re-weight emotional cost. No coincidence resolves; the rod’s final quiver costs her prior numbness. Legible price: survival-guilt absorbed in full, now permanently resident in skin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges inductively: cartography of loss is possible only by dwelling inside the missing voices. Subtext lives in gesture—ring warmed against thumb signals acceptance of perpetual ache. No final moral; last image of “quiet blaze enduring” invites multiple readings. Motif of melody re-weights from lure to burden, satisfying recurrence rule.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to tactile and sonic bandwidth; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Elara’s sensorium—“star-fallen metal,” “silent registers,” etc.—without register drift. Rhythm modulates: elongated clauses during absorption, clipped fragments at rod quivers. Compression taught early (“time seemed to hold its inhale”) and paid off at resumed constellations. Voice distinct enough to preclude by-line anonymity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; no template cadence detected. Information density high—single sentences deliver sensory data, emotional charge, and world rule. Metaphors stay consistent with sonic geography; no mixed vehicles. One scaffold pair spotted—“hidden depths now charted within” slightly paraphrases prior clause, but does not touch closure beat, so −0.2 only. Grammar, pronouns, tense clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fusion—blind cartography + ultrasonic forest + skin-language—is non-obvious and inseparable from emotional arc. Familiar grief-journey tropes transformed through tangible map-making of sound. Stillpoint as reflective pool of feeling re-prices standard “crystal cave” image by making it anti-visual. Risk taken with lyric accumulation pattern pays off; nothing could be swapped without breaking logic.</comment>
