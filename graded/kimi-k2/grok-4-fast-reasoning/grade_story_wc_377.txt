<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is lyrically rendered yet stays abstract—“quiet forge of sound,” “vivid spectrum fading”—so his contradictory impulses are announced, not dramatized in a single pressure-cooked moment. The seasonal muteness is evocative but never once interferes with a concrete choice; he simply watches the sculpture work. Because the final beat is a generalized nod rather than a costly micro-choice, the arc feels vicarious, not personally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the lingering resonance “etching truths into collective memory” reweights the premise and carries conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and the pattern of rising bell/ice refrains is taught early, but the piece leans on spectacle escalation rather than a protagonist decision to drive the final reconfiguration, muting causal punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The whispering bluff, iceberg fragment, and kinetic sculpture form a tight micro-setting whose wind access and refractive properties directly enable the climax; spatial choreography is clean. Selective sensory detail (wind-carved stone, prismatic veils) filters through Elias’s tuner bias, though a few phrases float toward tourist-catalog gorgeousness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is declared, then demonstrated as the symphony restores villagers’ hues; pressure heightens by accumulative intensification of bell/ice refrains. Yet Elias himself faces no narrowing options or visible price; the risk is purely thematic, not tactical, keeping the escalation one-notch removed from personal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder as endangered spectrum re-ignited through engineered awe. Subtext traffics in light/color metaphors for authenticity, culminating in a resonant final image without sermonizing. Some symbolic language (“truths would dull,” “gray monotony”) edges toward overt statement but stops short of final-paragraph thesis-spelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s tuner ear, cadence mimicking bell overtones; diction is controlled and consistent, no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is strong—sound over sight, resonance over speech—without POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates well, sentences breathe with the wind crescendo; most clauses perform double duty. A few adjacent near-paraphrases (“symphonies of truth,” “melodies that peeled back illusions”) and stacked metaphors in one high-pressure beat slightly dull propulsion, but no artifact obscures causality or closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing post-linguistic world-building with kinetic sound-sculpture gives a fresh angle on wonder-revival; iceberg-as-lens is memorable. While “art re-awakens numbed villagers” nods to familiar trope, the acoustic engineering specifics and seasonal muteness tilt it toward idiosyncratic synthesis rather than stock uplift.</comment>
