<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reluctant need for connection drives every beat; his interior split between rescuer identity and private ache is embodied in each micro-choice and the final slip-away without thanks. One hairline slip: “gnawed at his nomadic soul” leans label-speak, not embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: rumor → ascent → shared rock-touch → reciprocal circle → vanishing; closure lands as Earned Stasis (he forecloses permanence with the note). Orientation clean and single scene window respected.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivy-choked signal tower becomes tactile constraint (rusty stairs, cobwebs, lantern glare) that pressures ascent logistics; final image of ivy as “polite frame” recharges the motif and mirrors the new relational lattice. Still cap at 8.8, lacking environmental choice alteration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure loneliness) escalates from quips masking void to circle of shared touch; reciprocity manifests as visible cost when Elias leaves the rock and exits—trade-off enacted. One tightening, no false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Thematic question—can shared fragility cure solitude?—is answered via the rock exchange without sermonizing; final note reweights “loneliness” as a price paid for perpetual motion. Quiet ambiguity legible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct comic-desperate voice (“desperately jocular”) modulates from brittle jokes to cracked vulnerability; perceptual signature remains consistent. No POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose propels—compressed syntax under pressure, no loops, vivid selective sensory detail integrated into action. Final ivy image is cleanly crystallized.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Ivy station as lonely-heart hostel offers fresh synthesis of disaster-logistics romanticism; polite anarchy trope is transformed into relational micro-economy. No derivative echo.</comment>
