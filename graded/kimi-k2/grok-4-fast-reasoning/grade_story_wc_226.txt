<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—giddy mischief against the gravity of permanent judgment—remains vivid and embodied; her micro-choice to launch the first poem in the bone alcove crystallizes motive under pressure. The cost she feels (“her own truth…threatening to overwhelm the spectrum”) is palpable, but because we never see her actually risk discovery by the elders, the stakes feel partially asserted rather than dramatized. Still, the spectrum-building strategy grows logically from her artist-flawed need to avoid erasure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the refracted chorus drifts toward the spire, a visible reconfiguration that forecloses the elders’ single-beam ritual while forcing Elara to shoulder multiplied truths. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each added voice tightens density and raises her psychic cost—yet the elders’ physical absence keeps the external threat abstract, muting the final constraint’s tangibility. One causal beat away from 9+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers, “hollow bones” sighing, and the alabaster spire that drinks fog return as tactile obstacles and tools; the spire’s pulsing quartz directly mirrors/refracts their spoken shards, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—alcoves, mist layers, spire midpoint—and environmental logic stays consistent. High-band gate met: setting constrains choice and reweights closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will collective confession preempt authoritarian judgment—escalates as each poem adds another shard Elara must bear; the tightening is felt in her rising nausea rather than outside interference. Because elders remain off-page, the pressure is largely internalized; still, the Accumulative pattern shifts cadence toward breathless echo, satisfying cost clarity for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme refracts from singular absolution to prismatic responsibility; no character sermonizes, and the final image of softened echoes drifting “toward the mist” offers non-literal resonance. The concept of “multiplication over erasure” emerges entirely through concrete voicing of scavenger regrets. Minor reserve: theme is fore-grounded early in Elara’s intent, slightly reducing organic discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance tight to Elara; perceptual signature is painterly—“towers of bone rose like forgotten skeletons,” “fog’s breath…twisted into illusions”—yet syntactic rhythm accelerates under pressure, matching her reckless grin. No head-hop, no filter clutter, and the canyon’s hush permeates diction without purple overload. Distinctive, controlled, and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to fragment bursts as crowd poems layer; metaphors stay consistent (light/prism/bone) with only one risk—“forged hush” repeats three times but is pattern-taught. High density—e.g., “refracted the action through verse, each line a facet…”—advances all three vectors (character, setting, theme) simultaneously. No scaffold, no mixed vehicles; a hairline slip from absolute polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Combining canyon ossuary, echo-confession ritual, and poetry-as-prism yields a startling yet inevitable fusion; no trope catalog feels checked. The premise that language can literally fracture judgmental light is pursued without flinch, culminating in the spire’s pulsing response. Fresh, specific, and emotionally honest; risk distinction warranted.</comment>
