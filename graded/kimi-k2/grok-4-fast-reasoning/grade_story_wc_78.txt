<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leeward’s vow and tactile use of the mallet give him clear, escalating motive; interiority stays embodied in salt and wood. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. The earned crescendo—storm transmuted into orchard’s music—shows credible endurance with visible cost in vibrating fruit and spent energy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by driftwood circle; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s euphony shifts from restless to serene, the cost legible in Leeward’s lowered mallet and storm-wracked wood. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sound and pattern tightens until the final cadence reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sea, storm, and floating orchard are rendered through selective sensory detail—salt-kissed branches, sapphire shards—that constrain choices (every plank must be dubbed to survive). The orchard itself functions as micro-setting, its driftwood hull and vibrating fruit charging the final image. No orientation debt; spatial choreography holds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve the fragile orchard against scattering storm. One meaningful tightening—storm’s vanguard becomes full gale—forces Leeward to dub each obstacle into instrument. Cost is visible: spent effort, resonant wood, and the orchard’s survival now tied to perpetual musical vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: adversity as raw material for art. No explicit moralizing; the final image of buoyant, chiming orchard reweights prior struggle without statement. Subtext lives in the shift from “restless euphony” to “serene crescendo,” a conceptual repricing of chaos into harmony.</comment>

<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in barnacle-hook eyes and fractal visions. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses during dubbing, longer lulls in aftermath. No dialogue, so voice distinction is N/A. Elision of backstory is purposeful and paid off in resonance.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sound, motion, and metaphor without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language stays coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“cryptic script,” “fractal echoes”) fits the prophet’s idiom and never obscures causality.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard turned into resonant instrument is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test passed: the premise could not survive relocation or renaming. Risk-taking (storm as bass line, dub as ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the ending feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
