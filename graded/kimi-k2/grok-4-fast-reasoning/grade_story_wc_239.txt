<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The witness’s interiority is vivid—his doubt about whether he truly saw the end is embodied in the dictionary’s pages—but the story withholds any decisive choice that alters tactics; he merely observes and arbitrates. The cost is conceptual rather than personal, so the arc feels slightly external to him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the illusions shatter and the cosmos is laid bare, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. The spiral-arbitration pattern is taught early and paid off at the end, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The temple library is evoked with tactile specificity—books bound in extinct-star skins, shelves drifting across a “universe’s hiccup”—and these details constrain the witness’s path, forcing him to navigate by etymology. The setting’s scale and texture charge the final image of unified cosmos.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—truth versus cosmic illusion—is signaled early and escalates through each arbitration beat. The tightening is conceptual rather than visceral, but the cost is legible: the witness must surrender his own certainty to achieve unification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the witness’s quest: the tension between language as anchor and language as veil. The final image of shattered illusions offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The prose has a distinct, incantatory rhythm that mirrors the spiral structure; diction is precise and lexically textured (“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush”). No head-hopping or register drift; the voice remains singular and confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level craft is dense yet fluid; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. A few near-repetitions (“resounding hush,” “humble object”) are minor and do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of etymology, cosmic illusion, and spiral arbitration feels fresh and inevitable. The risk of a dictionary as cosmic key pays off through specificity and thematic integration.</comment>
