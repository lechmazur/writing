<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s chastity and quiet rebellion are consistent, but interiority drifts into lyric abstraction (“her heart quickened, but her face remained serene”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. No secondary character appears, so status crucible is N/A; her micro-choices (thread-pulling) align with motive yet the embodied cost is muffled by ornate filigree. She earns a renunciation, but the price feels aesthetic rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain holds: desire → approach → untangle → unlock → resonance. Orientation is swift and spatial logic stays clean. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism spill reframes her identity and forecloses courtesan passivity; cost is legible in the instant the snow no longer shields her. The lyric overlay slightly blurs cause/effect immediacy, keeping it under 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, snow-muffle, and prism sanctuary are viscerally anchored and filter through Elara’s sensorium; weather and light actively camouflage and reveal risk. The crystalline pavilion doubles as micro-setting that refracts echoes and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Place-names remain economical; only “veiled city” stays vague, a minor abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices—tightens as each thread removed releases an audible echo, narrowing physical and social safety. One meaningful escalation occurs at the lock-click; cost is conceptual (exposure) rather than tangible, sufficient for this length. No antagonist appears, but surveillance ambience supplies pressure; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of acoustic resistance to cultural lullaby emerges through echo imagery and thread metaphor, never sermonized. Final rainbow spill offers non-literal reweighting: individuality diffracted into public spectrum, social cost implied. Ambiguity lingers—will city truly hear?—yet complexity is honored without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; syntax elongates and contracts with caution versus release. No dialogue, so voice rests on imagistic diction that largely remains within plausible courtesan vocabulary. Occasional poetic overreach (“delicate as sonnets”) nudges register but pattern is consistent and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; stacked metaphors are purposeful but dense, risking purple haze (“rainbows across the snow, each facet alive…”). No loops or paraphrase; pronouns clean. One participle opener mis-sequences simultaneous acts, minor clarity dip.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Combining chaste courtesan with sonic rebellion freshens both tropes; prism as echo-archive is novel yet inevitable. City’s “lullaby” concept supplies conceptual lift without gimmickry. Risk lies in high lyric mode but coherence justifies it. Derivative DNA minimal—snowy courtyard familiar, yet prism sanctuary re-anchors it.</comment>
