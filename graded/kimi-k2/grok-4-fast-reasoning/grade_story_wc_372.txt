<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in the lantern-slide calibration and frequency sampling, but interior contradiction is thin; she never risks failure or questions her oath, so the arc is flat. The final beat re-stabilizes rather than reconfigures her stance—no visible cost or path foreclosed. Still, the occupational micro-choices are specific and consistent, keeping her above mid-tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the vows re-ignite, the library sighs, Elara’s vigil continues—cost is the ongoing servitude rather than a new forfeiture. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of sampling → recalibration → re-luminosity tightens the stake without causal reversal. Orientation is clear by line 30; no teleporting props. The beat sequence is linear and could use one tighter pivot, but coherence survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is not mere postcard; frost on breath, iced spines, and lantern-beam refraction constrain how Elara handles tools and times each movement. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, probe, slide, and gauge stay tracked. The quartz-hush tone modulates slightly when the lantern flickers, giving environmental feedback to stakes. One notch shy of 9 because the dome illusions are described but never interact with her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—vanishing vows—signaled early; pressure escalates through measurable frequency drops rather than external antagonist. The 432 Hz splintering supplies one vivid tightening beat that narrows options to manual recalibration. Cost is conceptual (endless vigil) rather than visceral; a sharper tangible loss would push higher. Escalation stays accumulative, coherent, and lens-consistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-versus-oblivion emerges from the lantern’s dying light and Elara’s refusal to let it lapse; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of “enduring light” reweights earlier frost imagery without moralizing. Subtextual hint that her own life-force fuels the vows lingers but remains under-played. Complexity is present yet could risk a touch more ambiguity for top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory filter; perceptual signature favors crystalline textures, precise measurements, hush. Syntax elongates in calm, shortens during probe insertion—rhythm mirrors attention. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within librarian-mystic lexicon. Voice distinctiveness is high, but one more idiosyncratic metaphor could elevate to 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is controlled; sentences vary in length and opening. Some metaphor density in paragraphs 2–3 flirts with purple but pattern is taught early and paid off in “quartz hush” finale. Zero loops, no synonym churn, pronouns clean. Occasional elevated participle openers slightly dilute urgency mid-scene, preventing full 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Frozen cloud-library, vow-frequency sampling, and lantern-slide restoration synthesize into a fresh archival-fantasy niche. Concept feels inevitable yet not derivative; no famous scene echoed. Risk is moderate—quiet victory rather than spectacle—but coherence justifies the choice. Could push higher with one more unexpected ontological implication about the vows.</comment>
