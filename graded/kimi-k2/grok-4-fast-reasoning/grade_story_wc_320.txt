<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior motive—“find the beginning in every ending”—is stated repeatedly but never sharpened into a concrete want she could lose. The ritual of listing biases is shown, yet no contradictory impulse collides with it; the choice to “let go” is risk-free, so no cost is legible. She finishes exactly where she started: hopeful interpreter with a new reading. Earned stasis requires a visible price; here the only toll is abstract “assumptions” cast into a gorge we never see strike bottom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: moonrise, climb, static, shard-glow, visor images accrete until the “shard of hush” re-weights the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—the dish now “harmoniously” tuned—so a before/after is legible, but the cost is conceptual only (she packs up unchanged). No constraint lingers to shape future tactics, muting resonance. Orientation crystal-clear by word 50; causality unbroken.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The tower’s groaning skeleton and updraft are tactile in every move, forcing slow foot-placement and filtering moonlight through girders. The Hollywood fragment’s cool hum supplies micro-setting that alters her grip and pacing. Environment is not just backdrop; it supplies the literal platform on which the receiver must be aligned, so setting constrains the final tactical choice. Specific, selective, lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is legible: harvest a usable signal tonight. Pressure stays single-note—will interference drown the whisper?—until she dumps “assumptions,” after which static resolves; tension plateaus rather than tightens. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no external obstacle exploited. Escalation is internal and declarative; cost remains conceptual, so the beat feels eased rather than driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-from-ruin emerges through mirrored images—dead towers, eroded gorge, revitalized signals—without authorial thesis. The shard-of-hush concept reconfigures noise into pattern, but it lands as a private vision rather than a shared societal re-pricing, keeping resonance intimate rather than urgent. Subtext stays implicit; no moral is preached. Sufficient for length, but not searing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person hovers close to Elara’s instrument-filtered perception; diction—“moonstone shards,” “parabolic curve,” “cosmic static”—is disciplined to her tech-mystic lexis. Rhythm flexes with ascent: longer sentences on climb, clipped phrases at apex. No POV leakage; no dialogue to test voice split. Distinctive, efficient, controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varied; sentences carry dual duty (action + atmosphere) with few throwaway openers. Occasional elevated flourish—“a storm held in perfect stasis”—but figurative density stays purposeful, taught early, and returns in closure. No loops or synonym churn. Clean mechanics; only micro-tighten “quietest finale hid the seed of renewal” to remove stock seed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of derelict broadcast city + fallen Hollywood starlet glamour into a functioning cosmic amplifier feels fresh and specific to this narrator. Mythic “lunar perigee” trope is justified by tide-of-static logic. Conceptual stake (tuning thought itself) risks abstraction but stays grounded in tactile tech. Not radically new, yet the synthesis is memorable and risk-commitment is evident.</comment>
