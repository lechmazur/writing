<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—cryptic surface vs. aching need to speak—are dramatized in every beat; the shard-warmed hand and tear-mist fusion embody the fierce tenderness. The final renunciation of silence is causally earned by the prior visions and the condensation-messages she literally writes with spirit-compelled fingers. Cost is visible: the mended shard and evaporated words show the path foreclosed. Interiority stays concrete; no label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “moment returns; decide anew” reweights the past with conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of condensation → message → vapor teaches the rule early and pays off in the final image. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4. Every beat accretes density: spirits’ song, shard pulse, window texts; no causal break. Cost is legible in the evaporating apology—silence finally released, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mangrove roots, drowned-chapel glass, and moonlit shard form a micro-setting that actively constrains action: vines block, glass receives text, shard channels light. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s medium-priority: she notices pulse, breath, condensation, not geography trivia. Spatial choreography is tight—feet sink, shard presses, words bead. Setting charges the final image: moonlight through healed glass = reclaimed tenderness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the unspoken apology—signaled in para 2. Escalation is textural: each condensation message deepens regret’s weight, narrowing options until the final “decide anew” crystallizes stance. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. One visible cost: the evaporating text literalizes the irreversible release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges recursively: silence as both shield and wound, reweighted when the same condensation that records apology vanishes. No moralizing; final image gives non-literal answer—unsent letters become night air. Motif of mending refracts from shard to heart without forcing allegory. Complexity preserved: forgiveness is self- and outward-directed simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person liminal POV sustains cryptic distance yet slips into visceral close-up (“shard hummed against the glass”). Syntax lengthens with tide-like clauses, then fractures in short evocation beats, mirroring emotional swells. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts intentionally. Diction stays within Elara’s spirit-touched lexicon—“singing spirits,” “fractured eyes”—without drift into academic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm alternates fluid cadences with clipped incantations; no template runs. Figurative language is selective—moonlight “healed” the shard once—never clutters high-pressure beats. No paraphrase loops; each sentence adds sensory or causal layer. Opening anchors voice and stake; final line recharges “rewrite the stars” with earned cosmological tilt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar grief-recovery arc is re-angled through spirit-written window fog and lithic regeneration, making the medium’s craft inseparable from emotional labor. Specificity—gargoyle shard, mangrove labyrinth—prevents generic transplant. Pattern of condensation-text-evaporation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring closure.</comment>
