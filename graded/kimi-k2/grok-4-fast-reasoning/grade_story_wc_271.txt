<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied grief and botanical talent are vivid; the photograph and orchid anchor her contradictory impulses. The final integration of loss into forward motion is earned and costly. Minor therapy-speak (“somatic markers”) slightly blurs interiority at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc from frozen stillness to integrated hope is cleanly causal. Closure—tucking the photograph as seed, not weight—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation and lens hold throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arboretum cliff, glasshouse humidity, and automated lighthouse create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her retreat and frames the final image. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal pressure without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry memory without paralysis—tightens through the freeze-to-sketch beat. The escalation is internal yet legible; the price is ongoing vulnerability, not cheap release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through orchid, photograph, and cliff-edge persistence. No moralizing; final image of “seed” reweights prior grief without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical, close third-person voice stays consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s illustrator’s eye. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with purposeful repetition (“pearl of stillness”) that accrues meaning. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she recalled how…”) and one mixed metaphor (“shrapnel like confetti from hell”) keep it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Familiar trauma-recovery arc is refreshed by botanical lens and lighthouse automation backdrop. The pearl motif’s organic return feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
