<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—proving scars can sing—drives every tactile choice; the coin-thread ritual embodies filial guilt turned healer’s vow. Interiority stays concrete, never drifts into label-speak; the “black sand in the union” instantiates her creed under pressure. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible when she slices bark with firefighting blade—compassion outranks vengeance. No contradictory impulse on-page; final stance costs her the coin’s old luck, a felt forfeiture that closes the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the graft humming under the coin reconfigures both ruin and witness, cost visible in the relinquished talisman. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scar, sand, coin, cloud migration layers until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation anchored by line 5; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—wanderer’s arrival—deepens stakes without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon, dunes, split elder tree, and volcanic sand are filtered through Elara’s fire-trained gaze; each sensory pick serves her ritual goal. The black sand micro-setting literally binds graft to host, constraining success. Spatial choreography clean: kneel, slice, sprinkle, bind—no impossible positions. Weather/cloud migration supplies temporal canvas rather than ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the scarred tree accept new life—signaled early; wanderer’s appearance intensifies thematic stakes without external coincidence resolving graft. Escalation is textural: each layered symbol (sand, coin, whispered vow) raises emotional cost until the coin’s glint hums. Protagonist agency steady; no reversal, but deepening sufficient for 750-word window. Cost legible in surrendering her father’s last relic to the bark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of redemptive song emerges through images—scar cambium, coin chord, kelp-drift hush—never sermonized. Final “song has begun” is understated CR that reweights all prior fire imagery. Subtext in wanderer’s touch to his cheek lets silence carry shared pain. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether the graft will truly take, yet emotional after-effect resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s fire-sharpened perception; perceptual signature consistent—“cloud herds,” “sunset veins in her scars.” Syntax breathes with ritual tempo, contracts slightly under blade pressure. No head-hopping; wanderer’s interior accessed only by gesture and hoarse line. Dialogue minimal, natural, sub-textural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentences open with differing parts of speech. Figurative density high but patterned early, paid off at closure; no mixed metaphors. Information often dual-job: “split and barren from the blaze that had claimed her father’s final stand” situates tree, backstory, and stakes in one sweep. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; occasional elevated diction justified by lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combines arson legacy, firefighter healer, and arboreal grafting in a fresh synthesis; not a trope checklist. Black-sand-as-renewal and coin-as-suture feel inevitable yet specific to this island psyche. Risk taken in quiet graft climax instead of fire spectacle; coherence maintained. Could edge higher with slightly more concrete island folklore to deepen uniqueness.</comment>
