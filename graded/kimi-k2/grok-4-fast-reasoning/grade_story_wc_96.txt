<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s “molting” is announced but never complicates a single on-page choice; the coffee-tin reveal is neat yet lacks prior behavioral seeds. Marcus fares better—his binding talent surfaces in action and the dream speech shows stakes. Relationship arc is legible (quiet alliance → shared risk) but status/power shifts stay off-stage; final “hope” is asserted, not embodied. No interior contradiction is dramatized, so the promised personality cycle feels decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: moon → sorting → tin → quotes-on-beams → circle → guard pass-by, each layer adding density rather than forcing causal turns. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “garden in gravel” image reweights prior fragments and leaves cost implicit but undeniable. However, orientation wobbles: the library’s physical relation to cellblocks and yard is never anchored, and the “weekly” compression blurs elapsed time. These slips don’t sever the lens but keep the piece below elite tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rusted shelves, warped metal, starlight on cracked spines—visuals are sharp, selective, and filtered through Elias’s poet eye. The library’s skeletal frame literally steers action (quote-inscribed beams become night-light lure), satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Spatial ground is weakest: distance from gate, guard tower, or cells is missing, so the guard’s flashlight feels dropped from nowhere. Still, object-as-setting (coffee tin, binding tools) constrains smuggling tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“reclaim stories vs. monotony”—is signaled early and escalates via smuggling risk, inscription act, and clandestine readings. No decisive reversal occurs; pressure accretes until the guard pass-by crystallizes the stakes without forcing collapse. Cost is conceptual (possible shakedown) rather than felt on-page, capping the score below 8. Agency sits with duo throughout; coincidence (guard timing) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>“Beauty from chaos” emerges via concrete acts—scrap verses, rebuilt shelves, whispered readings—never sermonized. The moon-fracture/light motif returns in the closing “luminous fracture of his soul,” reweighting earlier imagery without moralizing. Complexity is thin: no counter-argument that beauty might invite punishment, so theme feels one-note. Subtext operates mainly in image rather than character tension, yielding solid but not arresting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—“pages yellowed, spines cracked like old bones”—with rhythm that swells and subsides. No dialogue is required; when Marcus laughs it is rendered as rare ambient sound, keeping POV disciplined. Register holds street-poet diction throughout; occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous fracture”) reads as Elias’s self-poeticizing, not authorial drift. Compression in middle beats is taught early and remains legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; only one paraphrase loop detected (“chaos he’d always fled / prison’s raw disorder”). Mixed metaphors are few and minor (“match in wind” beside “blooming flowers in concrete”); they don’t tangle causality. Density is high—each line adds image or beat—yet rhythm breathes at emotional peaks. Proof-level errors absent; a strong line-level showing for this word count.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prison-library resistance tale is familiar, but the “monthly molt” tic and poet-scribe protagonist give it a fresh slant; without the molting complication, plot would unfold identically, muting the novelty. Coffee-tin smuggling and quote-inscribed beams are lovely specifics that feel inevitable once introduced. Risk is moderate: lyrical compression and accumulative structure rather than twist or world-rule subversion. Transformation partial—names and era could change without breaking arc—so originality stops short of distinction.</comment>
