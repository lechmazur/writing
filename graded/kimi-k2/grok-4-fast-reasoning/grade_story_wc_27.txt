<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and awkward confidence are embodied in curling toes and squared shoulders, grounding her motivation. The contradiction between her self-conscious body and decisive stride is dramatized, not labeled. Her final hum with the stones crystallizes an earned shift from scavenger to signal-caller, with the cost of abandoning anonymity. Interiority stays concrete, though the rebellion’s losses are summarized more than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance inside the stone circle re-weights the rebellion from scattered embers to a networked constellation. Causality is causal-lyric: the hum triggers visions that reframe past failures into future tactics. Orientation is clear by 120 words; the ancient circle’s incongruity is taught early and pays off. Cost is felt in the audible shift from lull to “storms to come.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The repair bay’s skeletal gantries and cracked ferrocrete are filtered through Elara’s scavenger eye, each rusted tool a potential resource. The stone circle’s glyphs glow against industrial decay, creating a charged micro-setting that constrains her final choice to stand barefoot on vibrating ground. Sensory detail is selective—cold metal, distant thunder—never touristic. The opera glasses function as both tool and charged object, magnifying stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reignite a stalled rebellion. Escalation occurs when the circle’s hum reframes scattered losses as connectable nodes, tightening options from passive scavenging to active signaling. No external antagonist; pressure is situational—cosmic indifference versus human agency. The final hum forecloses retreat, with the cost of exposure to Core Authority patrols.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: cosmic order versus human chaos, resolved not by victory but by alignment—Elara chooses to tune herself to the stones’ rhythm. Subtext resides in the opera glasses’ shift from nostalgic relic to tactical lens. The ending avoids moralizing; the hum’s promise of storms carries ambiguous cost. Resonance is earned, though the rebellion’s politics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual quirks—her toes curl, her pulse syncs with alien harmonics. Syntax mirrors her awkward confidence: long lyrical sentences interrupted by abrupt fragments when the hum spikes. No head-hopping; POV distance is stable. The voice is distinct, though occasional poetic abstractions edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; rhythm accelerates with the hum’s crescendo. Occasional purple tints (“thunderous serenity,” “velvet expanse”) risk density but serve atmospheric pressure. No loops or paraphrase clutter. Strong verbs—“sift,” “magnify,” “reignite”—propel momentum. Final line is crisp, recharging “thunderous serenity” with new menace.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—post-rebellion lull, ancient alien tech—are re-animated through Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and the opera glasses’ antique intimacy. The synthesis of stargazer and signal-amplifier feels fresh, not checklist. Risk lies in the lyrical mode itself; it pays off via the charged final image. No close echoes of iconic scenes.</comment>
