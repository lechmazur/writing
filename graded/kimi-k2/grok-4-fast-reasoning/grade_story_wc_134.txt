<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition to “magnify everyday magic” is concrete and idiosyncratic; her embodied panic as shadows coil (“cool and insistent”) sells the stakes. Interiority slips into dramatic self-diagnosis (“realized the unseen forces’ true nature”) at the very beat when contradiction should explode; a hairline disconnect between sensation and summary keeps her from an 8+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: vision gap → pearl touch → inhabitation; the final Earned Stasis (body claimed, will overwritten) carries visible cost. One micro-turn beats here: lens flips from amplification to possession, tightening options under the inferred Causal lens; only a trace of latency in foreshadowing the possession rule prevents 9-territory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cave is not backdrop—crystals modulate heartbeat, pool mirrors climax, pearl throbs in sync with song; environment literally channels the takeover. “Bioluminescent glow…luminous gloom” risks prettiness but stays anchored to POV tension; spatial choreography clean across single continuous move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic without losing self”—is signaled early; midpoint tightening (shadows promise power then demand body) forecloses retreat. Price is the protagonist’s erasure; agency visible in fight that fails. Escalation causal, one-step but sufficient for 750-word window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of wonder’s cost emerges through event, not lecture: the same current that lights a farmer’s field snuffs the seer. Final image reweights “bright darkness” from ambience to metaphysical price. One line edges toward thesis-statement (“realized…true nature”)—minor, but caps resonance short of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-limited clings to Elara’s synesthetic bias—“crystals…echoed her heartbeat”—prose flexes shorter under duress without breaking rhythm. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination; free-indirect filters “visions fracturing into chaos” with immediacy. Only a stray elevated phrase (“earth’s deep throat”) momentarily lifts above her idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variety, high information density; most sentences dual-purpose. Two adjacent near-repeats (“bright darkness…luminous gloom”) and a mixed metaphor (“frozen notes…woven echoes”) dull edge in peak paragraph—minor artifact that keeps sub-8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming” trope is refreshed by tying blindness to geological song the cave itself withholds. Crystalline setting plus possession via pearl is specific synthesis, not ornament. Risk is present but moderate; transformation clear yet not startling enough for top decile.</comment>
