<comment>Elias’s copyist precision and solitude are concrete, but his pivot from passive transcription to clandestine dust-animator is asserted more than dramatized; the broadcast supplies motive, yet the interior contradiction between obedience and rebellion is summarized rather than felt in a single micro-choice. Cost is present—the risk of censorship—but it never narrows his options on the page. Interiority stays vivid (“ink-stained fingers,” “ember light flickering”), avoiding label-speak, yet the emotional inflection arrives pre-cooked. Enough specificity to reach the 7-band, but the decisive beat lacks embodied pressure.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dust-written score is a Decisive Change that reconfigures Elias from transcriber to co-author, with conceptual cost—he is now complicit in outlawed narrative. Causal chain holds: pirate lyric → dust instruction → inscribed score → future performances. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. A single shard within default scope; one meaningful tightening is sufficient. Meets 9+ quick test on closure with cost, but the escalation beat is narrated rather than shown, keeping it just below the 9 gate.</comment>

<comment>Ember alcove, mist, thistles, and dust are rendered with selective sensory economy; the micro-setting (hidden radio dial glow) literally enables the central choice. Environment constrains action—fog muffles sound, coals provide covert light—charging the final image of luminous dust. Spatial choreography is stable; no geographic drift. Reaches 9-band gate: the glowing dust on the fresh score is inseparable from the closure image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—reviving stories under censorship—is signaled early and escalates once: the pirate instruction forces Elias to risk copying forbidden narrative into the scores. Agency is active (he sprinkles dust, hums the song), and the option space narrows—he crosses from legal to illegal acts with visible risk. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible. Sufficient for high band, though the pressure beat is compressed into a single paragraph and could carry more tactical friction.</comment>

<comment>Theme of narrative resurrection via humble debris emerges through image (dust motes, ember breath) rather than assertion; no final moralizing. Subtext operates in the double life of the scores—publicly legitimate, covertly seditious. The thistled-calm motif modulates from decorative to charged when dust stirred by that “calm” begins to speak. Ambiguity remains: we do not know if the orchestras will dare to play the hidden tales, letting the theme linger without tidy resolution.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice is stable, with diction calibrated to a meticulous copyist (“vellum,” “quill,” “transcription”). Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses when the dust first moves—then relaxes back to lyrical cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries the entire burden and remains distinct. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound of coals, visual slant of ember light, tactile ink stains.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled—one sustained metaphor of dust-as-memory—avoiding purple overload. Occasional lyrical uplift (“thistled calm”) is earned by prior pattern. High information density; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No artifacts touch closure; one hairline slip (“perpetual fog” repeated within 30 words) prevents 9+.</comment>

<comment>Famine of stories + pirate radio teaching dust to speak is a fresh synthesis; the idea that a copyist sneaks narrative DNA into orchestral parts via animated dust feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is taken with lyric accumulation rather than plot twists, and it pays off in the shimmering final image. Could swap names/places, but the occupational specificity (score copyist) and sensory triad (embers, mist, dust) anchor it uniquely. Minor deduction for thistle motif that decorates more than it constrains.</comment>
