<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is embodied and specific; the curl in her palm and her “cautious exuberance” reveal layered grief and hope. Theo’s guarded twitch and tearful wonder are credibly childlike. Their bond shifts from wary parallel to shared breath under eclipse pressure, earning the final hand-off of the curl as visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the curl transferred from Elena to Theo crystallizes a new shared stance toward loss. Causal chain—eclipse approaching → harmonica lesson → breath-sync under totality → talisman exchange—tightens without gaps. Orientation is anchored early and held.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sage Ridge is evoked through scent, texture, and root-dream metaphor that constrains movement and mood. The harmonica and curl act as micro-settings that focus choice. Eclipse light is rendered with selective sensory hierarchy, never tourist-catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can wonder survive grief?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the eclipse forces synchronized breath and talisman transfer. Cost is felt: Elena relinquishes relic, Theo risks feeling again. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through sage endurance, eclipse mechanics, and relic transfer without direct statement. Subtext resides in crushed leaf scent and tear-welled eyes. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elena’s perceptual signature—“mellow rhythm,” “softly adaptive”—and modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; Theo’s interior is shown only through gesture and harmonica response. Syntax mirrors hush and surge of eclipse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or pressure. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sensory verbs (“crushing it to release its earthy scent”) replace abstractions. Final line’s lullaby echo is earned and precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-wonder arc is refreshed by eclipse as crucible and sage-root metaphor. The harmonica-curl pairing feels specific to this voice. Risk lies in quietness, but payoff lands without gimmickry.</comment>
