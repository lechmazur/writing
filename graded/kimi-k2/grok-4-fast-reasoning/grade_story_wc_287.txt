<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her fingers linger on petals, her breath syncs with oars—yet the final resolve feels slightly pre-announced rather than wrested from live contradiction. The rosebush loss and father’s absence anchor motive, but the pivot from grief to communal garden plan is more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the scattering of petals under moonlight reconfigures meaning, trading private anchor for shared growth. Causal chain—petal fall → harbor ritual → new resolve—holds without gaps; cost is the relinquishing of the father’s literal cutting.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fire-escape grit and moonlit harbor are sharply evoked through scent of rust, slap of water, fractured silver paths. The bitting gauge tooth and pouch of petals act as micro-settings that constrain the final gesture, charging the image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to honor loss without being immobilized by it—tightens when the last petal drops. Escalation is quiet but legible: each oar stroke narrows options until the scattering commits her to a new, riskier form of cultivation.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience through shared vulnerability emerges via concrete ritual rather than statement. The moonlit petals refract the father’s “illuminate what lay concealed” ethic into a communal future, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded: “rusted metal perch,” “luminous harbor” read as Elara’s selective attention. Rhythm modulates from clipped fire-escape diction to the lull of oars, mirroring her emotional cadence without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“unraveling of the protected vulnerability”) skirts purple but remains tethered to Elara’s heightened moment.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The urban-garden-to-moonlit-ritual arc feels fresh, transforming familiar grief-into-growth trope through the specific heirloom tools and harbor setting. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
