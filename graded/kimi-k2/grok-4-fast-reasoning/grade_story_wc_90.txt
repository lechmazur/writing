<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifism and inherited trauma are vivid, but interiority slips into therapeutic paraphrase (“clinging to a code of non-harm that defined his every circuit”). The micro-choice to scan the tears is present, yet the gravitationally-lighter trait is announced rather than embodied under pressure; still, the final buoyant rise gives a credible costed shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the veil opens, ghosts drift free, Elias’s body literally rises—Earned Stasis with embodied cost. Causal chain (scan → stitch → tear integration → portal) holds; Orientation anchor met within 120 words. One minor loop: “recycled” applied to ship, air, probes in three adjacent sentences, but no closure contact, so −0.2 only.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Recycled-sphere hull, cracked viewport starlight, low-gravity float give tactile, POV-filtered anchors; the archive chamber and tear’s facets return to charge the final image. Micro-setting (the tear itself) constrains the ritual mechanics. No spatial drift; “brittle and yellowed” photographs supply sensory specificity without catalogue bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—liberate inherited shadows—signaled early; pressure tightens when each stitch binds a denied memory, foreclosing the option to remain passive. Cost is visible: Elias’s mass literally decreases, risking drift. One beat could sharpen a live risk of failure, but agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of compassion-as-engineered-emergence grows from the tear’s reflection and the stitch-pattern; no moralizing summary. Final image reweights earlier “ghostly” motif into serene release. Subtext in the tear’s shimmer vs. dried tears on photos gives quiet irony. Could resist the word “redemption” in last paragraph to let image speak fully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric middle distance, consistent with Elias’s code/ghost hybridity. Syntax lengthens during ritual calm, fragments slightly under sensor-data intake, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop; diction stays within post-human lexicon. One register drift: “mantras of harmony” edges toward self-help, but context absorbs it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Rhythm breathes with ritual pace; sentences vary openings, avoid template cadence. High density: “husks of forgotten probes” does world + mood + backstory in four words. Minor scaffold: “shadows lingered—unresolved fragments...demanding confrontation” restates the same idea thrice; −0.3. No mixed metaphor; closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fusing Buddhist relic with post-human shadow-work inside a scrap-built ark feels inevitable yet fresh; pacifist AI as archivist-medium is non-obvious. Risk in refusing violence even in memory pays off. Derivative drift narrowly avoided: “last human” trope is redeemed by tear-as-key and gravitational side-effect. Specificity of “Kwan Yin’s tear” anchors originality.</comment>
