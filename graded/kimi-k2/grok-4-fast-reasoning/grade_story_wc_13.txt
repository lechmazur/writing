<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s profession motivates every micro-choice: sketching guides her decisions, borrowed time pressures her tactics, and her illustrator’s eye charges the final echo. Flaws (curiosity, hubris) visibly compound in choices. Earned endurance at climax forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal linkage tightens cleanly: inciting desire → interrupted cadence signal → borrowed-time mechanics → uncage gate → echo-uncaging payoff. Closure (CR) reweights what infinity means with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (causal) holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Canals serve as dynamic pressure: breath-swells push the boat, canal junction is the micro-setting that alters tactics, and submerged arch is resource supplied by setting. Specific sensory filter (illustrator’s eye) anchors world rules early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncage echo birthplace) escalates when interrupted cadence narrows options and borrowed-time cost charges final beat. One vital middle choice (press pendant) tightens stakes. Giant’s stirring resets the clock with palpable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, borrowed time, and infinite echo emerge from concrete particulars; infinity loop recharging the final image offers resonant non-literal answer. Cruelty: legacy demands repayment, avoiding tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tight; sketchbook and pendant observations carry distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates from lyrical canal hush to cadence-fracture urgency without head-hopping. Voice specificity under pressure is excellent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, compressed, and propulsive: “waters parted like curtains” anchors without overwriting; no loops or scaffold. Syntactic variety mirrors pressure waves; high information density advances story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Echo-place premise is non-obvious synthesis of giant-nap and canal-vein imagery; risk-taking (sculpting time via dreams) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (infinity loop recharging final image) anchors legacy.</comment>
