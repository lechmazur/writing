<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is quietly specific—“mute eloquence,” tracing seams—yet his contradictory impulses (preserve silence vs. intervene) are told, not dramatized in scene. The final gesture earns an Earned Stasis, but the cost is implied rather than embodied; we see glass realign, not what Elias forfeits. Still, the perceptual signature holds: his astonishment stays credibly restrained, never tipping into self-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the realigned box reweights the covenant, hum returns, ghosts straighten—cost is the now-audible absence he must keep wordless. Accumulative lens holds: each ghost pause adds density until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is anchored by line 5; no因果 breaks. One scaffold (“unspoken words” repeated) slightly dulls the beat, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cracked hive frames, sun-bleached wood, and stained-glass micro-setting constrain every move; proximity to the box dictates the final alcove beat. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Elias notices wind-shifted sand, not tourist vistas. The oasis supplies both resource (relic) and hazard (drought memory) that charge the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating ghosts or drifting props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve silence without breaking covenant—is signaled early and tightens when ghosts encircle the box. One meaningful deepening: cracks in glass mirror land fissures, forcing the tactile micro-choice to trace the seam. Cost is conceptual—the hum’s return binds him to lifelong wordless stewardship—yet the price is more implied than viscerally felt. Sufficient for length, but not scalpel-sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete pattern—bees, ghosts, glass—without moralizing: stewardship mutates into silent penance. The final image reweights “mute eloquence” from solitude to vow, achieving CR. Ambiguity lingers: is the hum renewal or eternal sentence? One near-echo (“weight of unspoken words”) flirts with thesis, but placement mid-story avoids final-paragraph preach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-close hovers at restrained psychic distance; diction stays desert-spare yet lifts into lyric swells (“sky bled orange”) that feel owned by the recluse. No dialogue, so voice carries all; rhythm modulates—long breaths for reflection, clipped fragments when ghosts appear. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. One register stray: “conceptual repricing” diction is evaluator intrusion, not narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentence variety, and high density—“hands eternally reaching for combs that no longer existed” does three jobs. One paraphrase loop: “unspoken words” / “mute eloquence” twice in close succession; minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clusters. Final line hum rises without overwriting; image propels rather than stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Post-apian ghost-custodian premise feels fresh; stained-glass box as covenant archive is specific, not borrowed. Risk: lyric stillness in place of showdown, but coherence justifies the gamble. Transformation test fails—swap names, core holds—yet accrued bee/ghost/bare-desert synthesis is memorable enough for high-band entry.</comment>
