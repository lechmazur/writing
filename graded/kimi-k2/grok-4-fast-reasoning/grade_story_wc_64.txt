<question>1</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Elias feels specific and internally consistent, but his decisions never tighten stakes; everything happens to him. What pushes the mystery forward—picking up the case—reads as arbitrary cheer, not compelled choice. A passive protagonist keeps this below strong-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tapestry riddle lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image (echoing in the sovereign case) charges the closure beat by re-weighting earlier chess patterns with felt temporal cost. Causality stays intact under an accumulative lens—one deepening is enough—earning a high-band score despite minor setup spill.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The silo’s cool shadow and dew-lit grass are vivid, but the space never pushes Elias’s choices; micro-setting works, macro-setting decorates. Still, specificity and tactile detail raise it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unravelling the tapestry’s intention—is clear early and tightens once when symbols mirror the chess game. No major escalation beyond that single beat, keeping it shy of very strong.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of intentions as fluid echoes emerges through artifact and imagery rather than statement, yet no new angle is added to familiar gothic motifs. The closing reweighting (tapestry = unresolved duel) gives slight lift.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person close filters perception through Elias’s blithe lens with quirky syntax and tone shifts under pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but voice-specific. A distinct cadence holds through the final reprise.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm and metaphor are lush yet selective; the “velveteen gloom” refrain threads without paraphrase loops. No line-level opacity in key beats, though a few filler stems dull propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery gardener meets gothic riddle, but the resolution leans familiar. The sovereign-tapestry reprise gives a non-obvious twist, yet risk-taking remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s cheer stays decorative; no choice he makes alters stakes after finding the case. Passive observer role caps integration below the development gate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Antique case returns in closure with reweighted meaning (echoes to duel), meeting payoff gate after setup and beat involvement; specific mechanics matter when it clicks open to reveal tapestry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Uncharted echoes shape the tapestry reveal, but concept never presses on-cue tactics; one beat of symbolic mirroring trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Tender organization appears as décor in garden beds; no on-page constraint or tradeoff beyond neat planting patterns.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Untangling drives the climax by decoding symbols, but could be replaced by other method with minor edits—still, it decisively changes outcome.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.9</question>
<comment>Decoding threads is signaled early and used mechanically in one beat; details matter yet aren’t tested again before closure, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Cobalt silo’s shadow provides calming shelter and a cool workspace, but never pressures choices or supplies resources—micro-setting works, macro-setting decorates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.7</question>
<comment>Chess-clock aftermath is mentioned but not tracked as a live countdown that alters moves; loose temporal constraint trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.8</question>
<comment>Desire to uncover intentions is stated more than dramatized; friction between curiosity and risk remains abstract rather than paid in choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Velveteen gloom modulates from plush comfort to intimate revelation across scenes, charging the final reprise of unresolved echoes; tone consistency earns above mid-band.</comment>
