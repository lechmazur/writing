<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reflective locksmith nature is sharply particularized through tactile micro-choices—angling mirrors, filing gears—so interiority never drifts into label-speak. The arc from fleeing war-loss to bottling wonder is credibly powered by his trait of “peripheral focus,” which both enables the breakthrough and costs him solitude; the final Earned Stasis (“the harvest was his own reflection”) shows that cost on the page. One slip: the silhouettes that “urge him onward” are never tested or refused, so that pressure reads external rather than crucible-forged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and holds: each new angle-of-light thickens pattern until the cadence shift at twilight lands the Charged Poise (“the timer whirred faintly…full harvest”). Causality remains coherent—no teleporting props, no retro-fixes—and the closure beat carries undeniable conceptual cost: he bottles awe precisely because the world above is too wounded to receive it now. Orientation is clear within 60 words; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its peripheral echo angles dictate Elias’s mirror placements and supply the final cadence shift when the walls “sighed…across the lull’s weary end.” Veined floors, bruised-purple twilight, and shifting drip positions track spatially; no two descriptions repeat the same sensory ratio. Tool-as-setting qualifies—the timer’s mirrors evolve from buried relic to active echo-catcher—charging the final image under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“store wonder before the world’s wounds close the window”—is signaled early and tightens through each angle calibration; the midday soft-echo discovery narrows options to subtle murmurs, foreclosing loud capture. No external antagonist needed: pressure is situational, built from corroded gears and season’s haze. Visible price is legible on-page: weeks lost, solitude deepened, war-loss locked away. Could use one mid-process complication that costs materials or bodily stamina to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the cost of preserving awe inside rational cages: the cavern’s sigh endorses yet mourns the act. Subtext resides in mirror-play—peripheral glints stand for overlooked grief—so the final image reweights earlier “reflection” without moralizing. No thesis lines intrude; one faint echo of pseudo-profundity (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is uttered once and immediately dramatized, escaping penalty. Ambiguity lingers: will bottled echoes heal or merely haunt?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays close to Elias’s perceptual bias—“peripherally focused”—so syntax tilts toward sidelong noticing: “caught the faint gleam not from its center but from the fractured edges.” Rhythm accelerates with gerund strings during discovery, then lengthens in calibrations, matching attention under pressure. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; register remains within a crafts-man’s lexicon. One 9+ test met: voice modulation clearly heightens final cadence without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or synonym churn detected. Metaphors stay coherent—“veins of quartz pulsed like forgotten heartbeats” sustains geological body-parallel without violating physics. High information density: each line advances angle, echo, or emotional state; no scaffold sentences. Minor register loft in “conceptual repricing” phrase is earned by prior concrete work and appears outside the closure beat, so no 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “echo harvest” premise fuses locksmith precision with acoustic physics in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh; no genre template duplicates this exact calibration-of-reflection device. Risk choice—lyric accumulative structure instead of antagonist plot—pays off by reconfiguring meaning at the end without gimmickry. Specificity throughout (filing gears to match marble variances) anchors universals. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional arc collapses because only this cavern’s peripheral echo geometry works.</comment>
