<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s precognition and mentor-promise motive are vivid, embodied, and escalate to the final step into aurora; the eel-herding persona is distinctive, though secondary characters remain off-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a decisive, earned step into the aurora with visible cost—loss of solitude and embrace of unknown reunion—under an accumulative/lyric lens; orientation is swift and pattern holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tidal bluff, frictionless sea, and aurora are selective, sensory, and directly constrain ritual placement and final crossing; the star-dusted stones function as micro-setting that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform curse into directed vision—tightens once via the mandala activation; eel-energy surge crystallizes choice and forecloses retreat, with felt electric cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of pattern versus chaos emerges through concrete ritual and charged aurora image; no moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration of “promise” from sorrow to beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, textured prose maintains consistent third-limited psychic distance; purposeful elisions (mentor’s fate) taught early and paid off at closure without head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with ritual pacing; no loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon, propelling to the final auroral step.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Frictionless world and star-dust ritual synthesize fresh mythic science-fantasy; mentor-vanish trope is transformed through eel choreography and electromagnetic closure.</comment>
