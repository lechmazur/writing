<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and fractal aesthetic are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the instant she rubs the coin’s grooves she re-prioritizes tactics, proving interior contradiction under pressure. The final vow to carry the book shows credible renunciation with visible cost (the mural left to die). No second character on page, so relationship crucible exempt. Brief “her breath caught” skirts diagnostic-speak but is instantly grounded in tactile action, keeping the slip sub-deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sky-bright mural stays, crews advance, Elara exits—options re-weighted with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—coin → safe → book → new mural method—threads every beat; no teleporting props. Orientation anchored by line 3. Drive lens is Causal, held to last line. Only minor slack: demolition timeline announced early but never narrowed (no siren, no second hand), so pressure’s edge stays general rather than razor-specific.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Oak-chamber, scattered tomes, knothole stars, and approaching diesel vibration are filtered through Elara’s texture-vision, constraining how she moves and notices. Tree-grain whorls literally unlock the safe, marrying setting to plot. Sensory hierarchy obeys her handicap—touch and shadow over face. Spatial choreography clean; no floating shelves or impossible distances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the library’s memory—signaled in paragraph one. Mid-story tightening occurs when the book forces her to paint faces she cannot see, trading safe abstraction for intimate confrontation; this narrows options and raises emotional cost. External deadline (demolition) supplies mounting bass-note but lacks a tangible beat-by-beat escalation (no blade sighting, no crew shadow). Still, final image pays the price: mural completed, building doomed, her perceptual world permanently enlarged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “limits as gateway” emerges concretely: face-blindness first framed as cage, then as telescope that reveals hidden archive and new technique. Subtext resides in gesture—thumb on coin, brush on bark—rather than exposition. Final image reframes sky as human fractal without moralizing. No tidy maxim, just irreversible reconfiguration of sight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person hovers at a lyric close distance that stays inside Elara’s haptic cognition; syntax lengthens during calm, fractures during discovery (“grooves matched fractal-like whorls”). No head-hop. Diction remains painterly yet consistent with her professional lexicon. Occasional Latinate loft (“conceptual repricing”-adjacent phrases) nudges register upward but stays within reflective beat; does not leak into coin-discovery pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Density high: pigment unpacking, coin trace, safe groan each do double duty for atmosphere and cause. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for hush, staccato for rumble. Only micro-loop: “fractally precise” appears four times; slight redundancy but taught as motif and repaid in final mural. No mixed metaphor; tactile verbs (“kneeling,” “pried,” “slipped”) keep propulsion forward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing face-blindness, fractal portraiture, and arboreal archive yields a synthesis that feels inevitable yet uncatalogued. Risk is high—concept could collapse into gimmick—but grounding in tactile procedure earns payoff. Transformation test fails if Elara is simply renamed; her perceptual filter shapes every image. Fresh inflection: sky painted not as escape but as encrypted physiognomy, reversing the usual “portrait = identity” equation.</comment>
