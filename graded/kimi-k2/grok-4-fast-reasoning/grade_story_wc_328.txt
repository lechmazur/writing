<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s bitterness and quest for truth are vivid, but the metamorphosis leap feels slightly under-motivated; the cosmic-joke turn lands more as concept than embodied choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds; the arrowhead and phone form a tight causal spine leading to transformation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—her form and worldview shift on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subterranean garden is sensuously anchored with bioluminescent fungi and frost-kissed herbs; space and props (arrowhead, phone) constrain choices and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the missing—escalates through the phone’s confessions and arrowhead’s pull; the tightening is one decisive shift into metamorphosis with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “harmony untamed” emerges through concrete events; the cosmic-joke reframe is earned by the phone’s confessions and Elara’s bodily change, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Lush, lyrical voice remains consistent; occasional elevated diction (“gravitationally playful”) fits the speculative register. No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; a few stacked metaphors verge on purple but serve the fairy-tale tone. No loops or scaffold; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore, underground garden, and retro phone static; the metamorphosis into playful gravity feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
