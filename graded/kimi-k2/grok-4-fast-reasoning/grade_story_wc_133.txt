<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia and painter-identity are shown through action—night daubing, cracked-clay doorstep, brush in hand at the end—but interiority drifts into stock phrases (“phantom rains to combat the dryness of his soul”). The amber trade registers as a credible micro-choice that costs him an heirloom and buys sleep; still, Mira functions more as thematic mirror than crucible, so relationship pressure stays thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the exchange of brooch-for-story-and-water reweights Elias’s sleepless stance into earned slumber, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost under an Accumulative lens. Causality is linear and coherent; however, rain-trail mapping is declared rather than demonstrated—droplets are never shown steering his route—so the central method feels lightly teleported.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Island geography is anchored early (“accessible only at low tide via a treacherous causeway”) and clocks the ticking tide at the end; salt air, cracked clay, and metallic rain tang are filtered through Elias’s painterly eye. The brooch operates as micro-setting that charges the final exchange, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the mainland’s peace-deal remains a fuzzy off-stage postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—can Elias wrest a kernel of purpose from ruin—tightens when the rain offers ephemeral trails and the brooch demands exchange; the vial of water plus Mira’s intel foreclose solitude, paying a visible social cost. Escalation is single-cycle, adequate for 700 words, but pressure is more contemplative than urgent, keeping it below high-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: meaning is co-created, not excavated. The amber’s “preserved antiquity” and traded ownership quietly reprice survival from hoarding to sharing without sermon. The final sleep image resonates, yet the midpoint “unearthed convergence” phrase drifts toward thematic echo, blunting full subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic distance to Elias; perceptual signature is painterly—“silver veins,” “pigments onto salvaged driftwood”—and rhythm swells then contracts with tidal rain. No head-hopping; Mira’s voice is distinct in dialogue (“Unearthed convergence, you might call it”) without italicized interiority bleed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet disciplined: participle openings are sequential, metaphors stay physical, and information density remains high. Minor loop—“haggard awe” repeated verbatim—and a near-paraphrase pair (“wryly earnest, laced with a humor that twisted irony into quiet resolve”) slightly stall momentum, but artifacts never touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war tidal island and insomnia-painter are fresh enough, yet the scavenger-meets-artist exchange treads familiar post-apocalypse barter terrain. The amber-with-insect keeps it specific; still, the overall arc feels risk-cautious rather than boldly re-configured, capping originality short of the 9-band.</comment>
