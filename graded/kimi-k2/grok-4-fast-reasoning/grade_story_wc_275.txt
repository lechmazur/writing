<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist stance and “senselessly perceptive” gift are shown through tactile ritual, not label; the embedded petal/knife beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, yet the father-daughter contradiction is mostly summarized rather than enacted in scene, muting the final wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the dome stabilizes not by force but by the calm she sows, the scrap-bound rose becoming the charged image of continuity. Causal chain is light (scrap → ritual → crack stabilizes) but coherent under Accumulative lens; orientation and lens hold clean to the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dome, thorns, perpetual amber light, and the canvas scrap function as micro-settings that constrain her only viable tactic—quiet planting. Sensory hierarchy mirrors her pacifist bias; spatial choreography stays consistent as she kneels, buries, and rises.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve sanctuary/continuity—tightens once when the crack appears; the micro-choice to sheath the knife and embed the scrap forecloses violent defense with felt cost. Escalation is single-point but sufficient; storm complicates, calm earned, no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of peace-as-resilience emerges through action: knife sheathed, scrap planted, dome quiets. Final image of brighter blooms reframes “engraved quiet” without moralizing; ambiguity remains—will it hold?—yielding lingering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; diction of “tranquil blaze,” “thorny stems,” and “senseless perception” creates rhythmic signature. No dialogue, no head-hop; register consistent with her contemplative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies, information-dense; only minor scaffold (“she rose… she knelt…”) and one mixed metaphor (“flames frozen”). Hooks open and close well; no artifact touches the final embedding beat.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of pacifist botanist + post-crash rose farm feels fresh; the scrap-as-relic ritual transforms familiar eco-fable into personal ceremony. Risk in quiet climax pays off through charged image rather than spectacle.</comment>
