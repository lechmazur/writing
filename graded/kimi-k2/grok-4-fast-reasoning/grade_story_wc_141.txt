<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s skepticism, intellectual pride, and buried ache are shown through embodied reactions to the cello’s retellings; contradictory impulses (debunk vs. listen) coexist in scene. The shell’s warming pulsing against his palm externalizes the interior shift without label-speak. Micro-choice—eyes closing, accepting the hum—pays the cost of foreclosed certainty, earning credible change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causality unfolds as “because he plucks the cello, therefore buried voices retell”; each echo tightens his option space until enduring the final hum is the only path, landing Earned Stasis with felt cost. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. Closure reweights his crusade under Accumulative/Textural lens; persistent price (loss of debunker armor) is legible on the last line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory’s decaying dome, sea-roar, and littered optics filter through Elias’s goal-directed gaze; cracked lens mirrors his fractured certainty. Painted seashell functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice when its inward-aiming compass supplants north. Selective sensory hierarchy (touch of warmth, auditory hum) supports escalating interiority without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he dismantle or accept the myth—escalates via each cello-induced retelling that strips deniability. No external antagonist needed; pressure grows because each echo reconfigures knowledge until skepticism becomes unsustainable. Visible price: surrender of lifelong identity at the last sustained hum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—why we chase eternity in ephemera—emerges through pattern of fading voices and cooling shell; no final maxim states it. Final image of Elias descending with the “talisman of reimagined conversations” reweights prior debunking crusade into acceptance of transience, achieving Conceptual Repricing without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elias’s diction (“callused hands,” “riddles the universe tells itself”) and perceptual bias; no head-hop. Rhythm compresses under stress—sentence fragments mimic heartbeat when shell pulses—then lengthens for contemplative closure; pattern taught and paid off. Figurative language remains within his plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines carry two jobs (“dust motes dancing like forgotten constellations” paints setting + signals cosmic theme). Varied sentence openings, natural paragraph breaks. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold; only hairline slips—“gloomy cheerfulness” repeated thrice—keep it sub-9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Myth-buster confronted by irreducible mythic experience is familiar premise, yet specific acoustic device (half-built cello retelling memory) and inward-compass shell deliver fresh inflection. Emotional specificity of father/Mira retellings prevents archetype drift. Transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious in hindsight.</comment>
