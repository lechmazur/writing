<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and memory-hunger are vivid, but interiority drifts toward abstract nostalgia rather than embodied contradiction; the final recovery feels more granted than earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene descent to the greenhouse is cleanly anchored; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (memories flood back, sealing her to the past). Causal chain is thin—mushroom traced = memory returned—but holds under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sunken greenhouse and spectral apple trees are richly sensed, but the shipwrecks remain postcard backdrop; only the fairy ring actively constrains the final choice, keeping it from 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightened once via the mushroom’s hum; cost is the irreversible immersion in the past, but pressure plateaus rather than escalates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as tidal theft emerges through image and action; final glow reframes earlier nostalgia without moralizing. Subtext is strong, yet leans on familiar folkloric tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person close; sensory diction is character-specific. No dialogue, so voice is carried by textured interiority and rhythmic cadence that modulates with descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“spectral blooms,” “ethereal glow”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or artifacts in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Flooded orchard as memory vault is fresh; fairy-ring portal less so, but grounded in tactile detail. Risk lies in lyric density, not premise, and pays off in final image.</comment>
