<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s affectionate skepticism is enacted in every beat—she hugs while doubting, proposes a bodily alternative to pills, and her tactile micro-choices (hand on solar plexus, scar trace) force Theo’s stance to shift. The internal contradiction is live, embodied, and drives the final renunciation of chemical telepathy; cost is felt when she trades her static-shock skin for a shared canvas. One decimal off perfect only because Theo’s prior bootleg dose is recalled rather than dramatized, blurring the depth of his longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shock → somatic idea → geode lens → live-map → renunciation of pills, each beat foreclosing the last. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: they forego telepathy tech and accept the slower labor of body-reading, cost etched in the final rainbow print that now “glows eternal” without chemicals. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Studio is rendered through heat of gear: LED whir, cooling-fan breeze, gel streaks on fingers. Geode shard doubles as micro-setting—its fractal edges literally steer the light trails that become the emotional map, charging the final image. Warehouse loft never drifts into white-room; every prop is handled, refracted, or warmed by skin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“can intimacy exist without tech shortcuts?”—tightens when the recalled pill is rejected in favor of somatic mapping; the long-exposure timer supplies soft pressure. One meaningful deepening: the static-tingle on skin converts from obstacle to instrument, narrowing options to bodily truth. Price is visible: Theo’s skepticism softens under literal touch, foreclosing chemical escape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: embodied attention outperforms synthetic telepathy. No character states it; the final print’s gold/blue swirls reweight the premise without moralizing. The geode’s recursive layers echo their mutual recursion of touch and interpretation—image refracts idea, no thesis required.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-close hovers at Elara’s pulse: “willowglass hope,” “fractally precise,” diction stays within her artist-nerd lexicon. Rhythmic control—long sentences for exposure drift, clipped fragments for shock—mirrors somatic spikes. No head-hopping; Theo’s interior is inferred only through her sensate reading, preserving distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances light, skin, or emotion. Metaphors are coherent—geode as lens, static as spark—never mixed. High-density lines (“trails of colored LEDs danced across canvas like fireflies in a jar”) compress scene, mood, and stakes in one image. No scaffold, no filter-verb clusters, closure image left clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Takes the over-used “telepathy pill” trope and reframes it as a bodily optics experiment; muscovite shard as lens is fresh, not gimmicky. Somatic-marker science is married to light-painting technique in a way that feels inevitable yet unwritten. Risk—rejecting the sci-fi drug for artisanal corporeality—pays off in earned intimacy.</comment>
