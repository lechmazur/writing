<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s yearning is palpable, but his interior monologue drifts into lyrical abstraction (“noctilucent reckonings”) that tells us the insight rather than dramatizing it. The single decisive act—adjusting a loose panel—feels light against the grand rhetoric; we need one earlier beat where glasswork visibly fails or costs him something so the final touch lands as earned sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The textural/accumulative lens holds: the pebble toss → ripple reading → prism glow sequence tightens the thematic stake once. Closure is a Charged Poise: the “weight of illuminated truths” repackages prior imagery with conceptual cost. Yet the Orientation Test dings −0.3: place-time anchor is delayed until after word 120, and the mist/prism geography stays hazy; fortunately the final image still pays off the haze, so no further cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bay-at-dawn is rendered through glazier eyes—pearl light, salt-tanged air, the prism gazebo as working artifact—so setting filters occupational bias. Sensory hierarchy favors vision and tacit glass knowledge; damp boot-sink andminnow-ripples add tactile micro-setting. The prism atrium re-appears at closure to refract earlier ripples, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove mundane glass holds luminous worth—signaled early. Pressure escalates once: ripple-reading reveals “harmony” beneath regret, narrowing his stance from doubt to vocation-affirmation. Cost is conceptual (accepting fragility), but lacks a tangible forfeiture; hence stays below 8.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges via recurring light/refraction imagery rather than statement. The final image of the glazier’s reflection in rainbowed glass reweights routines as quietly heroic. Almost veers into thesis (“he aimed to exalt the everyday”) but pulls back to sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person psychic depth adopts glazier’s perceptual signature—planes of light, lens flaws, “panes of dawn’s fire.” Syntax lengthens with tide-like cadence, then compresses at the toss. No dialogue, so voice carries all; register stays within artisanal lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, sentences vary, paragraphs breathe. Occasional near-luxuriant phrase (“pearlescent glow,” “noctilucent reckoning”) but density suits reflective beat; no mixed metaphors or loops. Final line lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mundane craft elevated through optic metaphor feels fresh; ripples-as-divination less so, recalling familiar nature-mirror trope. Specific glass-working detail and harbor prism gazebo rescue premise from abstraction, giving memorable inflection.</comment>
