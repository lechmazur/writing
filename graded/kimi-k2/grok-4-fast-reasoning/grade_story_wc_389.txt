<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his breath fogging, palm on cobalt glass—but the “lonely visionary” label is asserted more than dramatized. His motives (forge dawn via radio prophecy) are clear, yet the shift from passive listener to active prophet happens largely off-stage, muting the cost. Still, embodied emotion and micro-choices under storm pressure keep him distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shattered portico and silent radio crystallize Elias’s stance—prophet triumphant yet irrevocably alone. Causal chain holds: radio fragments → poetic prophecy → villages realign → pane breaks → dawn breaks. Orientation is anchored early; one transition (past to present rise) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds is tactile and constraining: lightning etches scars, glass refracts danger, wind lashes the frame. The cobalt portico evolves from shelter to breached threshold, its shards charging the final image. Sensory selection narrows under crisis, grounding the cosmic stakes in bodily peril.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elias’s prophecy remake allegiances—tightens when the radio’s poetry begins steering real-world loyalties. One decisive intensification: the lightning-shattered pane floods the room with electric blue, forcing Elias to step into the storm and accept irreversible influence. Cost is visible: isolation confirmed, glass in fragments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the peril of wielding forgotten lore to reorder loyalty. Subtext lives in the radio’s static—whispers of “elders call the end” hint at cyclical hubris. Final image of dawn refracted through broken cobalt offers ambiguous resonance: renewal or ruin, left unsettled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, storm-battered, and lyric without purple drift: “thunder grumbled like a beast awakening,” “sapphire shards.” POV stays tight to Elias; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates—long breaths of description, then staccato prophecy—mirroring static bursts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, not ornamental. Minor loop risk in repeated “storm” and “shadow” motifs, but each recurrence reweights meaning. No clarity breaks; sentence variety supports mounting pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—mountaintop hermit prophet—made specific through radio poetry and cobalt portico. Synthesis of grit and whimsy feels inevitable: lightning as both menace and muse. Risky structural compression (rise of prophet via montage) pays off in resonant final image.</comment>
