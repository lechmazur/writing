<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession to “listen for unheard stories” is embodied in her needlework and feigned clumsiness, but the interior contradiction—wisdom masked as foolishness—never quite collides with itself on the page; we see the mask, not the moment it slips and costs her. The final beat folds the chart and chooses stealth, a credible renunciation, yet the emotional price feels inferred rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara crystallizes her stance—she will smuggle the synchronized chart rather than confront—foreclosing open defiance with the felt cost of ongoing secrecy. The causal chain (because she overheard comet whispers → therefore she maps discrepancies → therefore she hides the proof) holds cleanly under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory’s vents, spires, and candle-flame reflections are vivid and selective, but only the candle’s prismatic light actively constrains her final choice by synchronizing breath with revelation; the larger architecture remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the council’s telescope coup—escalates through Elara’s agency: each stitch narrows the conspirators’ room to lie. The tightening is clear, but the on-page cost (risk of discovery) is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed truth versus performative ignorance emerges through embroidery metaphors and the candle’s shifting light; the final folded chart wordlessly reweights the premise—knowledge must hide to survive—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical, star-dusted diction stays consistent; the perceptual signature is sharp (“sapphire hue drifted like forgotten constellations”). No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, with only minor loops (“whispers that no one else seemed to hear” echoes twice). Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Rhythm accelerates during synchronization, matching urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of astrophysics, embroidery, and espionage feels fresh; the “adjacent possibilities” conceit is seeded early and pays off in the final chart alignment. Specificity of bribe routes via wormhole doodles prevents generic feel.</comment>
