<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—dock-worker grit vs. mer-blood pull—is dramatized in one continuous motion from crate to dive; the “combative tenderness” toward her own suppressed nature shows in the way she polishes then hugs the scalding scrimshaw. The final shift into scales is earned because the bone has already burned her grip and the whale-song has rattled her sternum—cost is visceral, not declared. Still, the mother-imposed “land-bound normalcy” is asserted once rather than tested in a micro-choice, so the flaw never compounds action. At this length that single-exposition reliance keeps the arc just shy of the 8-band where every beat would reverberate through body and tool alike.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she dives, the dock-self literally dissolves with the scrimshaw, and the disappearing island’s re-submergence makes the cost irreversible—all legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens (density of bioluminescence → bone-glow → skin-glow). Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within the first 90 words and hold; the brief world rule (“after violence became impossible”) is stated, then respected. Causality keeps its because/therefore spine: crate → bone → whale → island → transformation; no prop teleports. The only slack is the island’s sudden appearance with no prior foreshadow except lore, so the tightening feels one beat late rather than foregone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is not backdrop but resistance: waist-deep water drags at each step, barnacles rasp wood off the crate, salt stings cracked knuckles—every tactile detail either slows or hastens Elara’s choices. Bioluminescent plankton and coral spires are filtered through dock-worker pragmatism (“water that frothed like whispered secrets”) so lyricism stays earned. The scrimshaw itself performs micro-setting duty, its engraved cove guiding her eyes and finally her body into the channel that matches the map. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body or prop positions across the wade, climb, dive sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—true-form vs. dock-self—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened by the bone’s heat and the whale’s call; each sensory hit raises the cost of clinging to land. One meaningful tightening occurs when the island solidifies: staying human now means swimming back to a life that literally vanishes behind her. Agency sits entirely with Elara—she pries, wades, presses bone to chest; coincidence appears only as complication (island surfaces), never as rescue. The price (loss of human legs / dock identity) is visible in the dissolving bone and fading shore, meeting the 8-band threshold but without persistent constraint beyond the moment of dive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—freedom through self-revelation rather than flight—emerges from the image chain: nets → maps → scales, each object re-weighted across the arc. The oceanic pacifist premise strips classic siren violence away, so “embrace” becomes the only weapon, a conceptual twist that reframes mer-identity outside predator tropes. No character moralizes; the final shimmer of scales answers every prior question without a declaring sentence. The slight reserve comes from the mother-backstory delivered in one summarizing clause, blunting the thematic counter-argument that land-life also offered belonging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays tightly latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—notice narrows to barnacle grit, plankton stars, bone warmth—and modulates distance: calm opening spreads contract into clause-fragment bursts (“burned hot… severing”) under peak pressure. Dock-worker idiom (“hauled nets,” “salt-sprayed”) keeps diction concrete; no lyrical flourish drifts into writerly self-consciousness. Whale-song and bioluminescence could slide into cliché, yet are re-seen through calloused palms rather than tourist awe. Voice remains consistent across the entire wade-climb-dive continuum, achieving 9-band control with only a hairline slip of abstract “freedom” used twice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm alternates long rolling cadences (swell imagery) with clipped fragments when the bone brands her palm, propulsion matching physical stress. Figurative layer is selective—three extended metaphors total—and each recurs (whisper-secrets, scattered stars, rusted locks) to build pattern rather than clutter. No scaffold or synonym churn; every noun earns specificity (“pebbled shore,” “crystalline pool”). Tiny register lift (“conceptual repricing”) appears only in this rubric, not the story text, so no penalty applies. The prose is clean enough for immediate copy-edit, landing just outside 9+ because one clause (“unlocking her guarded heart with visions”) nudges summary at the climax beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combining post-violence pacifist world-rule with mer-heritage is a fresh synthesis: the sirens’ traditional lethal song is impossible, so self-claiming must be tender—an angle not stock in either genre pool. The scrimshaw-as-key trope is redeemed by its double function: map and brand, object and pain. Disappearing island as earned mirror rather than CGI set-piece keeps the fantasy grounded in character stakes. Risk is present—lyric density, no dialogue, single-scene mythic arc—yet coherence survives, meriting the high-band bonus.</comment>
