<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear interior contradiction—detached dealer who secretly longs to feel—drives every beat; the embodied static-tingle mechanic makes emotion legible without label-speak. Final collapse into widower’s grief is earned because the causal chain (scent → chemistry → memory → empathy) is staged early and paid off with tactile cost (petal turns to dust in palm). Thoroughness trait shows up as on-page cataloguing and constrains her speed of surrender, sharpening the stakes. Only keeps her out of 9-band because no second character on page means relationship crucible and status shifts remain theoretical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: empathic fusion lands in the final breath with visible price—her laugh is “unfeigned,” the grotto light “fleeting,” signalling detachment is gone. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: scent density, pulse of amber walls, and static prickles intensify until knowledge/feeling divide reweights. Orientation anchored by word 60; no confusion. Single beat of causality (because she inhales the half-truth, therefore her barriers break) is enough for this length; cost is legible in crumbling petal and irrevocable laugh.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Amber grotto isn’t backdrop; its dimming veins time the transformation and mirror barrier-thinning. Petal-as-micro-setting meets 9+ gate: absorbent strip is handled thrice, dictates pacing of inhalation, and charges final image when it powders. Selective sensory triad—visual amber, olfactory lavender/citrus, tactile static—keeps economy tight. Only hairline slip is “twilight hush” cliché, not enough to dull specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain protected observer versus risk authentic pain—tightens once via scent-test; no reversals needed. Agency is decision to inhale; stakes escalate because same half-truth she sold now turns inward, foreclosing professional distance. Static prickle serves as on-page barometer of rising cost. Could hit 8.8+ if a concrete consequence (client reaction, income loss) threatened, but interior price is still felt and suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: half-truths as necessary bridge between isolation and communion. Subtext sits in petal’s formulation—joy laced with regret—mirroring her own fusion. Final laugh dissolves premise without moralising, achieving Conceptual Repricing. One hairline echo of “half truths” in last paragraph flirt with thematic statement but lands inside image, not lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance stable; lyric compressions (“winter’s first static kiss”) stay within dealer’s sensibility. Syntax lengthens during inhale, fragments at crest—rhythmic mimicry taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on sensorium; succeeds. Just shy of 9.0 because diction edges toward perfume-copy elegance once (“layered perfume: notes of…”), slightly perforating character-specific lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences couple scent chemistry, client memory, and interior shift. Mixed-metaphor guardrails hold—static maps emotional charge without overstretch. One scaffold pair (“She’d always sensed… Now…”) but it teaches pattern and vanishes before climax. A few adjectival stacks (“amber veins in the stone”) stay under threshold; no loops dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise of counterfeit-emotion dealer is fresh, intensified by olfactory delivery system and static-detection quirk. Risk of sentimentality avoided through clinical accretion of detail. Final reweighting—half-truths become stepping-stones to wholeness—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Not 9+ only because grotto-as-womb is faintly familiar; transformation arc itself is singular.</comment>
