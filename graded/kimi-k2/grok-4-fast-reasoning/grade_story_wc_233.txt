<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s disenchantment is concrete—her midnight exit, hem snagging, fingers on cobalt stone. Interiority stays sensory, not diagnostic. The final choice to seal the stars is motivated, yet the contradiction between royal self-loathing and instant spell-crafting isn’t dramatized under pressure; the cost is asserted rather than felt in body or status.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: dream → defiance → climb → shared breath → sealing. Orientation anchors by line 6; no teleporting props. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she descends “forever marked,” a conceptual cost that reweights rule-set. Minor slack: the curse’s mechanics are revealed only in the visions, so the final spell feels lightly prepped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Velvet cloak, thorns, bleeding fissures—details are selective, tactile, and mirror inner states. The cobalt grotto’s star-drinking stone constrains the climax: she must speak into it to stop the flow. Spatial track clean; no white-room. Environment could charge the final image even more had its unique physics (cold, resonance) pressed back against her spell.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the dream-curse or succumb—signals early and tightens once: the ridge ascent becomes irreversible after Lirian’s appearance. One meaningful deepening occurs inside the grotto when visions reveal the curse feeds on rulers’ despair, narrowing her options to act. Cost is conceptual (eternal marking) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it below the top band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of sovereignty versus cosmic futility emerges through star-blood and solitary crown. No moralizing; final image of “lace of danger” lingering on her reign reweights prior material. Subtext in shared breath/fireflies hints at solidarity without stating it. Could dig deeper into the irony that saving the stars may empty her throne—not yet fully mined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature—silken whisper, star-wounds—remains distinct. Syntax lengthens under fatigue, tightens in the grotto, supporting pressure. Dialogue sparse, idiom-appropriate. No head-hop. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction trespasses queen’s idiom in closing clause but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentences do dual work. Mixed metaphors avoided; “starlight bleeding” sustains. One scaffold paraphrase (“the climb a test of will against the mountain’s unyielding spine”) could compress. Filter verbs minimal. Rhythm modulates with altitude, breathes at ledge, accelerates into cavern—controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Royal-star-curse is familiar, yet the firefly-breath conduit and queen-as-catalyst feel fresh. Specificity of cobalt stone drinking sky, not generic cave, helps. Risk-taking moderate—linear ascent, no structural twist. Transformation hinges on personal marking more than world-rule change; hence not top-tier inventive but solidly above template.</comment>
