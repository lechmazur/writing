<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—cling vs. release—are dramatized in her literal grip on the carving blank; the sculpture project she chooses is a credible, visible cost that forecloses wallowing forever. Interiority stays concrete (“the hollow in her chest”) and circus-bred specificity grounds her perceptions. She is the only on-page character, so status/relationship bullets are N/A; her arc meets the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens declared and held: crystal memories accrete until the blank is re-weighted as vessel, culminating in Charged Poise as the first chisel stroke lands. Orientation is crisp within 60 words; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat (“etching peace into the wood one stroke at a time”) carries undeniable conceptual cost: chaos of grief is now committed to a single irreversible shape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ash blank literally constrains her next act—she can’t carve memory until she decides which grain to follow—meeting the 9+ gate. Rain-beaded skylight filters every visual, sound, and even time perception (“rain a lullaby”), while the loft’s height above abandoned circus grounds mirrors her emotional suspension. Spatial choreography is immaculate; objects (kettle, blank, tools) are tracked without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contain grief before it scatters—is signaled in para 3 and tightens when the kettle’s overflow snaps her back, forcing the shift from memory-harvest to physical carving. Accumulative pressure grows with each crystal shard; the final narrowing (start carving NOW) is irreversible and legible. Cost is felt in the blank’s transformation and the emotional forfeiture of endless reminiscence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—“loss as material to be shaped, not absolved”—emerges through image rather than declaration; the ash wood’s burn-rate quietly mirrors grief’s slow smoke. Final image answers the core question wordlessly: peace is not discovered but carved, stroke by stroke. No moralizing, just reweighted meaning. One felicitous line (“harvest it, or it harvests you”) flirts with echo but is earned by scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays snug inside Elara’s circus-tuned perceptions; no head-hop. Diction favors tactile verbs—crack, trace, etch—mirroring her rope-rough hands. Rhythm swells then contracts with memory bursts, matching the “crystallized time” conceit. Dialogue is absent by design; narrative voice alone carries subtext and remains distinct without drifting into sentimental music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or filler; each sentence lengthens or shortens to pace breath versus pressure. Figurative choices (rain beads as prisms, crystals on spider-silk) stay precise and non-contradictory. Filter verbs are scant and voice-driven. Opening and closing lines book-end with rain-beats, giving lyric circularity without scaffold. No artifact touches the closure stroke.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “crystallized time” conceit refreshes standard widow-grief terrain by externalizing memory as fracture-able mineral, making familiar arc feel specific to circus life and woodcraft. Ash blank as grief-container is non-obvious yet inevitable once invoked. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than plot reversals—but coherence is total, creating a memorable miniature.</comment>
