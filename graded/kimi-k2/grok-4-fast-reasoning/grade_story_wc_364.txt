<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s interior contradiction—meek yet stubbornly resolved—stays concrete through bodily micro-choices (wrapping silk, measured hammer taps). Quiet determination turns to costly action, but the epiphany beat (“confusion swirled…”) drifts into label-speak, muting embodied cost. A single POV piece, so relationship bullets N/A. Meek trait drives the decisive descent, earns the final stance; still, emotional layering flattens in the climactic shaft vigil, keeping it just below 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each hammer strike therefore awakens subterranean vines that therefore stabilize arches. Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands on-page: frayed silk + anchored arches = visible cost. Orientation is clear by word 60; no debt. One meaningful tightening—strike in the mine—reweights stakes. Cost is legible in the frayed silk, persistent constraint shaping future barters. A micro time dilation (“hours passed”) is tolerated inside lyric beat. Clean causality, no amnesia; misses 9 only because escalation is single-cycle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystalline orchards, floating arches, azure leaves—vivid tri-sense filter through Elowen’s smith-eye attention to texture and weight. Heartgrove mine functions as micro-setting whose rubble literally supplies the resurrection medium; tool (hammer) and environment jointly constrain tactics. Spatial choreography is immaculate: lantern hand, silk hand, descent steps tracked. No white-room syndrome; every descriptor either pressures choice or reappears in closure (azure sky after azure silk). Just shy of 9 because one phrase (“sweet rot of unripe crystals”) leans ornamental without tactile consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save orchards from arch-collapse—signaled in paragraph 1. Stakes tighten once: hammer-on-silk beat converts debris into anchoring vines, foreclosing the “do nothing” option with visible price (silk frays). Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence absent. No secondary antagonist needed; planet decay supplies coherent pressure. Cost is legible and persistent. Lacks a second reversal or ancillary loss, capping it low-8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Theme of “resilience through bartered sacrifice” emerges via image chain—tools traded for silk, silk traded for planetary spine—never sermonized. Final azure defiance reweights earlier azure motifs without moral. Subtext of meekness-as-steel surfaces in hammer rhythm; no thematic echo crimes. Could use one more concrete counter-reading to push 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Limited-third stays locked to Elowen’s perceptual bandwidth; no head-hop. Prose rhythm mirrors smith cadence—measured, percussive, then elongated in shaft descent. Diction stays within rural blacksmith lexicon except one near-cliché “forgotten dreams”; forgivable. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Distinct internal idiom sustained; psych distance clean. Earns 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence runs. Information density high—single sentences do setting + metaphor + emotional charge (“shattered arch fragments mingled with orchard soil, a graveyard of potential”). One paraphrase loop (“deliberate and measured”) costs −0.2. Mixed-metaphor check clean. No artifact touches closure beat. Minor scaffold in opening paragraph but cleared by midpoint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Fantasy trope of planetary decay + chosen one is refreshed through blacksmith POV and geobotanical logic (arch-roots stabilized by crystalline vines). Bartered starlight silk feels particular, not loot-table item. Transformation test fails if renamed, thanks to smith-specific process beats. No close famous echoes. Risk is moderate; could push further if silk price carried personal wound.</comment>
