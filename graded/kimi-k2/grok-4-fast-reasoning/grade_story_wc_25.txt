<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet “whispers > shouts” creed is dramatized through the stealth rescue and the final handshake with the coin; Marco’s bull-gait contrast supplies crucible pressure. Interiority stays concrete—heel-strike echolocation, micro-choice to pocket the coin—without label-speak. The only drag: Marco’s panic is seen from outside, so the relationship shift feels reported, not mutually embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: storm fries nav → Marco bets → Elias deploys gait-skill + coin-hack → hidden panel opens. Closure is a crisp Decisive Change: Marco extracted, Elias’s creed vindicated, cost paid in exposed secret hack. Orientation set within 40 words; no teleporting props. Slight causal soft spot: the hack’s storm-powered hydraulics are declared, not foreshadowed, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Port-container maze is lived-in: dented warnings, ozone reek, groaning walls that guide Elias’s vent-whisper tactic. Micro-setting coin re-appears in final gleam, reweighting the “key with no lock” rule. Aurora and scrambled compass tighten every choice; no postcard stacks. One minor spatial blur: we lose exact distance between vent-whisper source and Marco’s dead-end, just short of 9-band clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Single stake—prove subtlety beats bombast—tightens when Elias’s whisper-route becomes the only viable rescue after GPS collapse. Agency drives escalation: he chooses stealth tracking, vent-calls, coin-trigger; each move forecloses Marco’s yell-strategy. Visible cost: secret maintenance hack revealed to crew. Storm coincidence complicates, doesn’t solve; satisfies lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: stealth circuitry outperforms macho noise. Final image—coin warm, aurora fading—quietly reweights the opening boast without moralizing. Subtext in Marco’s stunned surrender suffices, though his interior silence keeps thematic counter-voice thinner than ideal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Elias’s sensory bias—heel-echo vocabulary, fold-map angles—producing a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm accelerates under storm whine; sentences tighten during vent-whisper beats. No head-hops; register stays blue-collar maritime. One mini-lapse: “auroras flickered unnaturally low” sounds slightly writerly against his mechanical idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density: stacked containers “snared the unwary” marries hazard to POV judgment in one stroke. No paraphrase loops; metaphor vehicles (rusted monoliths, secret current) stay consistent. Occasional elevated clause (“calculated spontaneity”) edges toward register drift but doesn’t stall momentum or obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Gait-recognition sleuth inside a storm-blinded container maze feels fresh; the coin-as-macro-key twist repurposes astrological etching into industrial hack, transforming familiar talisman trope. Risk is taken: storm powers hidden hydraulics—borderline rule-change—but foreshadowed by magnetic pulses early, so payoff reads earned. Could edge higher with deeper aftermath consequence.</comment>
