<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied, specific, and contradictory (fear vs longing); a micro-choice (handing the hair) triggers the revelation that recharges closure. Motivation shifts from passive grief to active resolve, showing earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when starlight reweights the trapped idea; causality links Locksmith action to freeing the unity concept with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Starlight and nexus act like a luminous hinge, not just scenery; light bends reality and guides choice. Specific cosmic descriptors anchor scene and mirror Elara’s inner warp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fear vs cosmic union supplies one dominant stake; pressure tightens from paralysis to irrevocable choice. Both beats are driven by Elara’s agency with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The unity-across-stars idea reconfigures prior grief into quiet resolve; the final image recharges the earlier star-hair ribbon motif without overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person free indirect style tracks Elara’s biased perception; rhythmic compression under disorientation sounds inevitable. No head-hopping or ornamental purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dense, vivid, propulsive prose; no loops or filler. Metaphor use is limited, pattern-taught, and resolved at closure (starlight lock → ribbon knot).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Cosmic nexus + memory-hair + star-locked idea is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable. Transformation of hair into luminous key justifies the unlikely premise.</comment>
