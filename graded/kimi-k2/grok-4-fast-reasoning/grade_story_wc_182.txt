<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” label is dramatized in the frond-pluck/ash-reveal beat, but interiority drifts into lofty editorial summary (“her motivation burned fierce”) rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choice visibly costs her anything, so closure feels efficient, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: traveler’s rupture → lore gap research → guardian renegotiation → vault opens. Yet closure pays with a sprinkle of ash dust, not a felt forfeiture; the “rescue” itself is off-stage, blunting the promised Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Mountain-sized bookstore and bioluminescent ferns are tactile, POV-filtered, and supply the key tool (frond) that cracks the guardian’s contract. Spatial choreography stays intact; environment directly shapes the winning tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“mend rifts, free souls”—is declared early; pressure tightens once when Elara weaponizes a lore omission. Still, escalation is mostly intellectual (translation puzzle) and the price paid is gestural, keeping cost more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of redressing history’s ignored lessons emerges through fern-echo imagery and guardian blind-spot rather than thesis statement. Final image (diary mending timelines) quietly reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Voice keeps lyrical texture consistent with POV’s arcane-linguist bias; syntax is varied, register stable. Compressed metaphors (“pages rustling like strings plucked in a void”) occasionally crowd the beat but remain legible and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is musical yet dense—three consecutive stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats create mild muddle. A few near-repeat phrases (“labyrinthine,” “unheard symphony”) could be pruned without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Melding botanical linguistics with time-fracture librarianship feels fresh; the fern-ash cryptography turn is specific and memorable. Concept is bold, but centering negotiation with a spectral curator nods to genre convention, slightly softening risk.</comment>
