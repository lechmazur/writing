<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-anchored interiority is visceral; the trembling hand, the remembered hush before the swing, the etched rake-splinters all embody cowardice under pressure. The contradiction between public custodian of order and private breaker of it powers every beat. Only the brother-ghost’s silent nod feels slightly convenient, blunting the cost curve at the exact hinge where a harder refusal might have hurt more.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Elias descends the tower clutching the relic, the path to confession now irreversible, community trust the visible price. Causal chain is tight—pendulum pause → vision → returned artifact → public act—each because/therefore link narrows his options. Only the very first paragraph delays spatial anchoring past the 120-word soft mark, but the later payoff waives the penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, lantern-lit gears, and bioluminescent tide pools fuse into a single pressure membrane that literally guides Elias’s footing toward the buried rake. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through his professional eye for balance and fracture. The tower’s “shadowed core” and the ridge’s “razor edges” recur just enough to charge the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—public timekeeper’s moral credibility—tightens when the ghost offers the very proof that could destroy it. The rake’s reappearance converts private guilt into impending communal rupture, forcing a public choice. Pressure escalates once, decisively; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: disclosure now looms, foreclosing the thirty-year penance of silent winding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of absolution emerges through the rake’s salt-etched splinters, not pronouncement. The final image—tower bell at dawn sounding “a promise rather than a dirge”—reweights every prior toll without moralizing. Only the phrase “restore that shared balance” flirts with Echo; it is brief and embedded in action, so the slip is fractional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration keeps a tight psychic distance, syntax mimicking the pendulum’s swing in balanced cadences. Diction stays within a custodian’s lexicon—“gear,” “bob,” “toll”—except for one lyrical spike, “searing reverie,” which is flagged by the prompt itself and thus permitted. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet muscular; sentences advance both tactile image and moral torque (“the tides had preserved it, returning it now”). Metaphors of glass, fracture, and mirroring cohere without muddling causality. Occasional adjective pairs (“jagged spine of black volcanic glass”) risk minor purple, but never within the climactic beat, so the closure image stays sharp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of clockwork precision with tidal ghostlore feels fresh; the returned rake as confessional scripture transforms a humble farm tool into moral evidence. Incremental absolution via carved micro-confessions is an inventive twist on the scarred-object trope. The risk is moderate—lyric ghost vision inside mechanical realism—but the piece commits fully, landing a coherent hybrid texture.</comment>
