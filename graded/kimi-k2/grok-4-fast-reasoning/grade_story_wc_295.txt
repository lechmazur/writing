<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning to decode the temple inscriptions is explicit, but the interior contradiction between solitary scholarship and communal healing is only asserted, not dramatized in-scene; her “heals with words” trait appears as label until the dream-vision, so the cost of that gift is still abstract. The micro-choice to weave empathy into the cosmic staircase moment is present yet floats in dream logic without risking anything concrete on her waking body or future. Mentor’s spectral lantern is a beat of pressure, but because it repeats advice already given in the telegram, the relationship doesn’t tilt. Closure lands as insight, not irrevocable renunciation, so the change feels intellectual rather than a path foreclosed at personal price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of star-dream echo builds density until the temple inscription reweights the premise. Orientation is swift—observatory hill, midnight, worn chair within 60 words—so no penalty. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “words, spoken in vulnerability, decode the soul’s enigmas” revalues her chronicles; cost is implied (she must now expose her own vulnerability) but not yet felt on page, so 9+ gate stays shut. The causal chain is thin—stars are watched, dream is entered, inscription simply appears—but within lyric mode the reconfiguration is legible and coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Observatory is sketched with selective brass, leather, dome hum; the telegram-as-lantern recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors hold across the dream transition—she remains seated while mind roams—so no drift. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile paper and faint floral scent over vistas, suiting a scholar’s focus. Environment does not physically constrain her choices, so 9+ gate remains unmet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode temple wisdom; tightening occurs when dream-vision reveals shared burdens as key, but this is received wisdom, not an action that narrows waking options. Agency is observational—she “reaches out” in dream with words that ease phantom figures, yet no visible price (fatigue, social risk, memory loss) attaches to her awake self. Pressure is lyrical, not situational, adequate for Accumulative lens but shy of 8.8 cost requirement. No live option is foreclosed; she ends inspired, not cornered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of communal vs. solitary burden emerges through star/dream parallelism rather than declaration; final inscription line is the only overt statement and it is placed at climax so −0.4 thematic-echo penalty applies, but not fatal. Subtext operates in the telegram’s pressed petals—fragility of memory, need to transmit tenderness. Ambiguity remains: will she dare share her own burdens, or merely chronicle others’? Emotional aftereffect is gentle uplift rather than searing recognition, keeping score sub-9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“starred sea,” “ethereal weights”) is elevated yet consistent with a poet-scholar’s idiom. Rhythm lengthens during dream voyage, contracts at dawn awakening, mirroring pulse of discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“she witnessed,” “she saw”) are frequent but serve dream-reportage; they dull immediacy slightly yet pattern is taught early and holds, preserving clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety is strong; stacked metaphors in dream sequence flirt with purple but stay coherent under Accumulative lens. No paraphrase loops or template cadences detected. Occasional elevated latinate diction (“crystallized final moment”) momentarily lifts POV above prior texture, but lapse is brief. Closure image “daylily’s petals seemed to stir” is precise, unscaffolded, and lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fuses lucid-dream chronicle with variable-star cryptography—fresh synthesis, not trope recycling. Temple inscription payoff risks soft profundity but is grounded by prior telegram plea, so feels earned rather than grafted. Risk is moderate: dream vision solves intellectual puzzle without bodily stakes, keeping score below true daring. Specific detail of daylily-pressed telegram rescues premise from generic mysticism.</comment>
