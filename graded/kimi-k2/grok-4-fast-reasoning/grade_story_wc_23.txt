<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the moon-phase mind-flux and bronze censer anchor contradictory impulses. His midnight calls enact micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values—solace through service—yet the wife remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is inferred, not staged. The earned renunciation (staying to guide others) carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dead beacon is replaced by a living web of voices, crystallized in the final crescent-lit dial. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each call layers density until the station’s silence is re-weighted. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Salt, rust, starlight, and the bronze censer create a tactile micro-setting that constrains every move. Sensory selection narrows to the rotary phone’s frayed cord and the censer’s warming heft, charging the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects track without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to transmute personal loss into communal return—tightens with each midnight call. Agency is Elias’s renunciation of reunion in favor of guidance; the cost is the widening distance from his wife. Escalation is accumulative: each riddle adds another thread to the reverse-migration web, foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief repurposed as cartography for others’ homeward paths. The bronze censer shifts from relic to living conduit, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the riddles’ star-patterns—navigation as love language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is salt-raw, lyrical, and consistent; compression like “geography of loss” is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with lunar phases. Dialogue crackles with subtext: “Follow the echo of the lost bell” carries both route and elegy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates with the gibbous moon, then exhales under the crescent, mirroring Elias’s clarity flux.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The reverse-migration premise—guiding inland return via maritime riddles—feels fresh and inevitable. The censer-as-compass and moon-phase cognition are specific, non-obvious syntheses. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
