<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias’s “chivalrous thief” code is asserted rather than dramatized; we never see him spare a foe or weigh mercy against gain. Interiority leans on abstract labels—“wonder,” “balance,” “entropy’s gloom”—instead of visceral contradiction. The final swap earns poignancy only because the pocket sundial and Lirra’s nod externalize the cost; Elias’s own hierarchy of values stays static.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: corrupted pieces → sky wrong → swap ritual → sky right, each swap tightening stakes through spectral resistance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses his apprentice anonymity and accepts custodial burden, visible in Lirra’s nod. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives by line 3; no penalty. Minor slack: the Veil’s rules appear only when needed, so the king-piece vortex feels convenient rather than foreshadowed.</comment>

<comment>Frost-etched runes, hovering crystals, and the frozen chessboard are tactile, selective, and filtered through Elias’s thief-attention—proximity, texture, risk. The spire’s verticality and cold actively shape stealth tempo; the brass sundial functions as micro-setting, timing each swap. Final-image charge: the board’s “harmonious play” reconfigures the prior frozen tableau, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mend the sky or doom the realms—signals early and tightens with each spectral guardian wave; every swap costs bodily risk and fleeting time-windows. Agency is continuous: Elias’s ritual choices directly weaken the Veil’s resistance. Cost is visible—sweat beading in sub-zero air, sundial flares, cracked guardians—yet the king-piece climax leans on abstract “vortex of unraveling stars” rather than a palpable last price, capping the tension just short of 8+ brilliance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—sacred play against entropy—emerges through the act of swapping wonder-laden chess pieces rather than exposition. The re-carved knight’s scroll of renewal and queen’s runes of unity particularize the moral calculus without moralizing. Closure reweights the premise: thievery elevated to custodial artistry, an image stronger than any stated thesis. A trace of abstract buzz (“entropy’s gloom”) weakens specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps psychic distance steady; diction—“palmed,” “twisted into position,” “shadowless dance”—mirrors a thief’s tactile precision. Rhythm escalates with clipped clauses during guardian attacks, then exhales into longer cadences for the king swap, aligning breath to risk. No head-hopping or register drift; the one-line spoken cue from Lirra carries mythic indirection suitable to archetype rather than dialogue obligation. Voice remains consistent and distinctive under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences layer goal, texture, and stakes simultaneously (“ice crystals suspended like wary eyes”). Figurative vehicles stay coherent—cold, sharp, celestial—and avoid purple overload. Occasional template stems (“piece by piece,” “one by one”) create faint drumbeat but do not stall momentum or cloud closure. No paraphrase loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffolding artifacts in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Core combo—“chivalrous thief” + “cosmic chess balance”—recombs familiar tropes, but the carved hollow pieces filled with scroll-spells and the pocket sundial as astrolabe add fresh mechanic specificity. The apprenticeship frame could swap with any mentor paradigm, yet the “sacred play” tenet is particularized through ritual sleight-of-hand rather than lecture. Final reconfiguration (thief → custodian) feels inevitable yet not derivative, earning moderate risk bonus.</comment>
