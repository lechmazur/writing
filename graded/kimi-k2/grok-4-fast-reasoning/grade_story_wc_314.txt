<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (logic vs. intuition) are dramatized in the crystal-flame beat. The final choice to embrace wonder is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the crystal’s loss). Minor slip: “secretly sentimental” is asserted more than embodied in dialogue or gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the melt of the crystal and the starling sigil reconfigure Elara’s stance with felt cost. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore advances her toward the decisive change. Orientation is anchored early; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s micro-setting (crystal pool, moonlit fruit) constrains her ritual choices and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is filtered through Elara’s alchemical priorities; no static cataloguing. One hairline slip: “ancient freshness” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition—tightens when the starling patterns expose flaws in her equations. Escalation is driven by her agency (holding crystal to flame) and culminates in a visible price: the crystal liquefies, foreclosing reversion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the synthesis of reason and wonder is embodied in the alchemical act, not stated. Final image of the orchard under stars offers a resonant, non-literal answer—balance achieved through loss. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating with emotional pressure. Perceptual signature—Elara’s alchemical gaze—colors every detail. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the flame beat. Occasional lyrical excess is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful. One minor mixed metaphor—“liquid prisms” momentarily jars—does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest for balance is made fresh through alchemical specificity and the starling omen. Synthesis of science and magic feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
