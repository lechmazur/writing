<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to “cultivate foresight” is embodied in every beat—he kneels for the patch, climbs for vantage, logs data—yet interiority stays surface-level; no contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the arc feels single-track rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain (wind-tunnel geometry → crash → survey → redesign blueprint) is lucid; closure crystallizes as a Charged Poise where Elias seals the tablet with the patch over his heart, foreclosing rest until lessons are forged. Orientation is immediate; no caps triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is tactile—rusted flanks, salt crust, fog-thickened air—and actively funnels wind; the anemometer and patch act as micro-settings that constrain choices. Sensory selection mirrors urgency without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent next crash—tightens as each gust reading forecloses prior assumptions; cost is felt in Elias’s bodily fatigue and the town’s silence. One meaningful escalation suffices under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of foresight carved from ruin emerges through pattern: wind vectors, torn metal, salvaged patch. Final image of investigator walking into lengthening shadows reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elias’s perceptual signature—salt sting, digital flicker, boot crunch—without head-hop. Syntax tightens under pressure: clipped clauses mirror gust spikes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, propulsive; no loops or mixed metaphors. “Fog thickening the air” and “wind bent like a blade” are precise, earned. No artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Crash-investigation trope is refreshed by microburst physics within container canyons; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk lies in quiet, procedural focus rather than spectacle—bold for flash length.</comment>
