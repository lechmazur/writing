<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blind empathy and methodical art practice are vivid, but interiority drifts toward abstract self-diagnosis (“awaken dormant empathy”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final sketch choice is earned yet the cost feels intellectual more than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: ribbon discovery → sketch → insight → tomorrow’s presentation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the cold case with conceptual cost; orientation is clear by 120 words and lens stays Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quarry mist, limestone, thornbush, and ribbon are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s tactile bias; the setting constrains movement and frames the final sketch, charging the closure image with palpable cold and echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive communal empathy via art—tightens when ribbon evidence reappears; one meaningful deepening as sketch unifies opposites, narrowing options to confront detective tomorrow. Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as bridge between opposites emerges through image (mask ribbon vs. quarry stone) and action (sketch unifying them), never stated. Final sketch offers resonant, non-literal answer to communal silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, textured, and perceptually biased toward tactile detail; no dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional lyrical elevation (“mist clung…like forgotten regrets”) is pattern-taught and pays off in final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, though “lance” metaphor risks mild overwriting. No loops or scaffold; minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase but does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist as cold-case sleuth via art. Familiar noir quarry setting is re-seen through synesthetic empathy; transformation test passes—story would collapse without Elara’s specific perceptual lens.</comment>
