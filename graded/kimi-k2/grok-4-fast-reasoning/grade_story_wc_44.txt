<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with shadows-at-noon is lucid and her tactile rune-work shows micro-choices, yet interiority drifts into generic “cosmos secrets” shorthand; the final Earned Stasis feels credible but the emotional cost is asserted (“island hum aligned”) rather than embodied—still, she’s individualised enough to lift the piece above mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the Null-Vault revelation reframes the noon-shadow mystery with Conceptual Repricing (balance restoration hinges on her key). Causal chain is intact—key → orrery → hologram → insight—but some hologram mechanics are front-loaded exposition; orientation is strong within the word-limit, and one meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Crystal orrery and brass key act as micro-setting that constrains every rune she etches; aerial island supplies sensory altitude (ethereal wind, sway) without generic fantasy clutter. Selective detail keeps momentum, though “luminous clouds” leans stock; key object’s reprise at dawn charges the final image, meeting the ≥8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solve noon-shadow exile) is signalled early; pressure tightens when fragmented visions demand she “relearn” or lose the answer. Cost is visible—trance exhaustion, key’s fading warmth—but escalation feels once-off rather than iterative; still, agency drives the final loop-closure, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as repair of a bent world, loops as responsibility. Subtext stays in gesture (silent key withdrawal at dawn). Final image avoids moralising, though the cosmic-restoration thesis edges close to prompt-echo—kept just ambiguous enough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person registers Elara’s precise, slightly archaic diction; rhythmic control tightens under pressure (“breaths syncing with automaton ticks”). No dialogue to distort voice; perceptual signature (rune-trace attention) stays distinct. Minor filter phrases (“she realised”) intrude but pattern holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, high-density, with strong verbs (“etched”, “whirred”); metaphors stay consistent (clockwork, fireflies) and support theme. Occasional cadence loops (“quietly deliberate” repeated) and one mixed image (“stars wheeled…like melting wax”) nudge it below 8.8, but no artifacts obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Post-Bending cutlery apocalypse and shadow-eating noon portal feel fresh; spoon origin is waved at butRunes-as-mechanism blends magic-tech without checklist vibe. Premise not fully transformed beyond key-to-door reveal, yet the synthesis is memorable, specific to this text, and elevated by micro-setting risk.</comment>
