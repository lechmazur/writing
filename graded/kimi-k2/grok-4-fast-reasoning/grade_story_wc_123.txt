<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulous vocation is credibly shown through handling the pigeon, but only one micro-choice (the decision to encode data later) is dramatized; interiority is lush yet loops round static reflection (“integrity,” “solitude” repeated) without contradictory impulse on the page. Cost is gestured, not felt: we never see him risk a logbook, lie, or mis-record. The trait set is vivid but the beat-level tension stays cerebral. Sentence template churn in “layered tranquility” recycles rather than complicates his stance, so the arc is steady-state not crucible.</question>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer and record-keeping ritual thickens the paranoia until the tube crystallizes a new tactic. Closure is Charged Poise—the courtyard hush re-weights his future course—so the form satisfies 600-word scale. Yet causality is thin: the follower is inferred not tested, and the “rogue signals” stake is announced by note rather than dramatized. Orientation arrives quickly, but the single beat of agency (pocket the tube, plan codes) is low-impact; cost is conceptual, not tactile.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Courtyard’s moss tiles, dovecote silhouette, and dusk palette act as micro-setting that quietly mirrors Elias’s hush-under-pressure stance; the tube supplies tactile prop-interaction twice, qualifying for 9+ gate. Sensory selection is POV-tethered—meteorologist eyes register wind-shift rather than tourist catalog. Spatial track stays clean across the single scene. A stray overlap “amber and shadow, a layered tranquility” repeats visual phrasing within three sentences, a minor loop that keeps it sub-9.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—zone corruption vs. recorder truth—surfaces early, but escalation is ambient: the note merely names the threat; storms never encroach physically here. No visible price (tool lost, data destroyed, identity blown) attaches to the beat; pressure intensifies only by implication. Lateral encoding plan is a future off-ramp, not a present trade-off, so options don’t visibly narrow on page. The beat satisfies textural deepening yet stops one click short of felt cost required for 8-band entry.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance through observation emerges organically; no thesis line moralizes. The pigeon’s return re-weights “recording” from passive to subversive, yielding modest resonance. Ambiguity about sender keeps complexity alive. However, reflection loops re-state rather than deepen the idea, preventing a sharper conceptual repricing.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature leans meteorological—barometric diction, wind imagery—giving texture without showy pyrotechnics. Rhythm subtly lengthens in calms, contracts when pigeon arrives, mirroring attention. Filter verbs appear (“he felt eyes”) but stay in character’s idiom and are sparse. No dialogue to test; internal voice is consistent if occasionally self-echoing.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined: strong verbs (“slipped,” “ruffled”), concrete nouns (“flagstones,” “dovecote”). Figurative load is moderate and pattern-taught (“layered tranquility” refrain). Paraphrase loops minor (“quiet act of defiance,” “quiet courtyard at dusk”); not severe enough to stall momentum. Closing sentence lands clean, no mixed metaphors or register drift. One template run of “his…his…” could trim for 9-band.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Storm-watcher + rogue-zone seed feels fresh when filtered through record-keeper POV; carrier-pigeon espionage layer adds sideways intrigue. Specific sensory bricks (barometric pressure notes, jasmine scent) prevent stock dystopia. Concept of “lateral paths” matches theme but is imported late by note rather than dramatized, muting ingenuity. Still, synthesis of meteorology and resistance documentation offers non-obvious angle.</question>
