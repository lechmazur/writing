<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior arc from brittle isolation to earned self-reliance is clear and embodied; fragile awakenings solidify into decisive flight. Micro-choices (tracing the sundial gnomon, aligning the solstice light) show hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: reincarnation memory → sundial activation → spectral flock → flight. One continuous scene; orientation anchored early; closure lands as a Charged Poise of wings above the clouds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atomically reflective sundial and tidal library are specific environments that constrain choices and supply resources; final image reweights the closed system in the stone-circle hum.</comment>

<comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail; no loops or scaffold; high information density, final image charges without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct solitary Aetherian uses ancient relic to achieve spectral independence; quiet transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
