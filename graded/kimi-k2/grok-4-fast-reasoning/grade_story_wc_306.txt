<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her desire to “welcome nuance into certainty” is concrete, embodied in the mirror shard and the act of unhooking. The contradictory pull between escape and self-interrogation is kept active in scene. Thorne remains a cipher; his “sincerely insincere” mask is asserted not shown, so his pressure on her feels stylised rather than personal. Still, her final micro-choice carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chimes’ resumed song and the mirror filling with dawn re-weight her stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is light—Thorne’s cipher-status means the chime-reading could be swapped—but the pattern is taught early and the final image crystallises options with felt cost. No orientation debt; lighthouse geography is stable. One meaningful tightening suffices at 799 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sea-salt wind, rusted hooks, and the spiral stairs are filtered through Elara’s fatigue; weathered glass and shell-metal timbres constrain the chime deciphering. The lighthouse balcony functions as micro-setting, its gusts literally powering the method. Detail is selective, never touristic; the hollow mirror shard serves as portable setting that charges the final image. Environment, body, and tool all meet the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—leave or stay in the city job—is signalled early. Escalation is textural: each new chime tone layers density rather than narrows causal options. The decisive turn is her internal unhooking, foreclosing paralysis with on-page cost (the wind whipping the empty cloak away). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the dilemma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through the chime sequence and mirror void rather than exposition. The final image reframes prior motifs without moralising. One friction: “cloak of doubt” is named repeatedly; this near-thesis echo nudges score down from 8+. Still, ambiguity lingers—Thorne’s own flicker of doubt complicates any platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person focalisation stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is fatigue-tinged, wind-skewed. Syntax lengthens under doubt, clips at the unhooking beat. Thorne’s dialogue is cadenced, slightly archaic, befitting a wandering “conscience for hire.” No head-hopping; psychic distance clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, sentences breathe with gusts. No loops or scaffold; “cloak of doubt” repetition is the only near-loop, but it serves as motif anchor. Figurative load is high yet coherent—wind-chimes as “whispers from the ether” stays within lighthouse logic. Strong verbs (“clinking,” “tugging”) keep propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope—seeker meets mystic advisor—is freshened by the hollow mirror shard and the sonic divination method. Chimes built from shipwreck salvage give tactile specificity. Risk is moderate; no structural gamble, but the Accumulative/Textural closure feels earned rather than borrowed. Could swap Thorne for any oracle, capping score below 8.</comment>
