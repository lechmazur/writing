<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity is vivid, but “bewildered” never complicates her choices; she passively receives visions instead of making a micro-choice that costs her anything on the page. The final resolve (“catalog no more”) is declared, not dramatized, so the turn feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the blank cameo reweights her mission—yet the cost is only asserted (“courting madness”) rather than felt in-scene. Nonlinear inheritance functions as Accumulative pattern; one tightening beat suffices, but the bathroom epiphany is delivered in retrospective summary, blurring the cause-to-effect linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is singular, its crystalline petals filtering twilight through the viewport, constraining Elara’s isolation and focus. Micro-setting inside the metallic bathroom supplies the mirror and recycled-air hum that catalyze breakthrough; spatial anchors hold, though orbital mechanics are hand-waved.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—possession vs. surrender to forbidden knowledge—is signaled early. Pressure rises when visions flood in, but escalation is narrated rather than enacted; no live option is foreclosed on the page, so the tightening is visible only in abstract “warnings of paradox.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear legacy emerges through iridescent shell and orchard imagery; final image of stepping into blossoms reweights prior cataloging as obsolete pursuit. Avoids moralizing, yet insight is delivered in expository bursts rather than gesture or subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lush, synesthetic diction (“petals unfurling like forgotten stars”) stays within a curator-astronomer’s lexicon; rhythmic escalation mirrors visionary overload. No POV slippage; free-indirect style clean. Occasional cadence drift into elevated philosophic register is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong information density—most sentences advance image or concept. Repetitive “brightened disquiet / simply complicated” pairing and stacked similes in final third slow momentum; no clarity break, but cadence loops dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pistachio-shell-as-quantum-codex is fresh; orchard planted by time-displaced gardeners deepens the concept. Risky nonlinear structure is taught early and paid off, though echoes of “forbidden knowledge” trope slightly blunt novelty.</comment>
