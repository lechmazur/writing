<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to tattoo a cosmic verse is vivid, but her interior contradictions stay static; the “obsidian grace” refrain performs stoicism rather than showing fracture under pain. Spontaneous anchoring is declared, never tested against a counter-urge, so the final lift feels pre-sanctioned, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the verse fleches skyward, re-weighting exile into authorship with felt cost in the glowing wound. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of gaps, dust, ink, stars—taught early and held; orientation anchors within 120 words. One scaffold loop (“obsidian grace” ×4) slightly dulls the crescendo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Garden, pond, moonstone dust, and constellations interleave with action; the fungi-veined path literally guides her circuit, body-as-setting constrains the tattoo act, and star-mirror charges the final lift. Selective sensory triage keeps texture efficient; dusk palette risks monotony but is saved by shifting light on ink.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defy erasure by scripting memory into skin—tightens once: first line etched → pain → fledging. No reversal, but deepening works under Accumulative lens: each gap observed adds filament to the verse-wing, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in blood-bright ink and irreversible skin-alteration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of art versus sanctioned forgetting emerges through image (tattoo as sky-bridge) rather than statement; final constellation re-prices exile as creative agency. “Obsidian grace” leans toward thesis-repeat, blunting ambiguity; still, the mortal scale of a single skin against cosmic void keeps resonance specific.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s sensorium; diction tidal, synesthetic, sea-cold. Rhythm surges and withdraws like surf, mirroring tension. Occasional elevated latinate clauses (“aspire beyond”) momentarily drift from dancer’s embodied lexicon but occur outside peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>High figurative density stays purposeful under lyric mode; mixed light metaphors never collide. Repetition of “obsidian grace” becomes incantatory but edges paraphrase-loop; filter verbs minimal. Strong paragraph cuts, varied sentence openings, momentum breathes with beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-tattoo that climbs off skin into constellation feels fresh; nostalgia-ban backdrop offers sociopolitical edge rarely paired with mystic body-art. Risk-taking in lyric Accumulative structure pays off, though moonstone catalyst is familiar trope. Specific coastal imagery rescues premise from abstraction.</comment>
