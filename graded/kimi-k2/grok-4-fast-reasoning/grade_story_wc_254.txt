<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s aesthetic drive is repeatedly stated but only once visibly impacts action (wading into thawing ice). Interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction; no contradictory impulse is dramatized under pressure. The “tremor of certainty” is told, not embodied as a cost-carrying choice, so final stride feels pre-declared rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake-merging image crystallizes a new boundary-free world with felt aesthetic cost (ice cracked, cloak drenched). Accumulative lens holds: cadence and image density escalate until the final reconfiguration. One causal gap—no motive shown for why paraphrasing dissolves walls—but the lyric pattern taught early excuses it under poetic logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake and quartz colonnade are not backdrop; their changing states (cracking, humming) directly enable and record the boundary dissolution. Cobalt light reflecting through ice reappears in the final image, visually repricing the premise. Micro-setting (her ankle-deep step) supplies the tactile cost that charges closure. Orientation anchored within 50 words; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim art/ether unity—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: paraphrase melts walls, forcing the literal step into frigid water; price is immediate cold soak. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer intensifies until ice yields. No second reversal, but single deepening suffices for 700-word lyric arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image pattern: cracked ice = shattered decree, bioluminescent blooms = reclaimed art. No moral stated; final dawn image reweights earlier “lantern-moth hush” into liberated glow. Ambiguity remains—was transgression worth frostbite?—inviting reflection without tidy answer. Recurrent light/water motifs constrain choices rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—cloud, moth, quartz song. Syntax stretches into incantatory cadence that mirrors colonnade hum, then contracts for the step into water. No head-hop; metaphors remain within her aesthetic lexicon. Voice-driven fragments (“lantern-moth hush”) taught early and paid off in final dawn wing-beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: long anaphoric clauses build hum, then short splash as foot breaks ice. Information dual-loaded (“her cloak trailing shadows that danced across the quartz pillars”). No scaffold loops; each sentence adds sensory shift. Minor purple tendency (“cobalt atrium shimmered in hues of deep, electric blue”) but does not occlude causal line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet who rewrites reality by paraphrasing stone song is fresh; avoids chosen-one template. Boundary dissolution mechanic grows logically from quartz acoustics rather than late rule patch. Risky lyric density commits fully; frostbite cost keeps it grounded. Could swap lake for sea, but colonnade-hum conceit is story-specific and memorable.</comment>
