<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief is embodied in tactile craft, but her interiority drifts into abstract “curtains of intention” therapy-speak that blurs contradiction. The micro-choice to gift the lotus is present yet feels externally orchestrated rather than wrestled from flaw. Lira’s hollow eyes are sketched, not tested; no status tension complicates the transfer. Overall, a serviceable arc but insufficiently lived-in under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s smile signals earned stasis, the cost her own grief softened by Lira’s bloom. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the stencil-to-origami chain is coherent but leans on coincidence (Lira’s arrival) rather than tightening choice. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One transition (workshop fire → observatory) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s mist-shrouded spire and dissolving clocks are vivid, selective, and thematically apt. Sensory hierarchy favors starlight and metal chill, guiding Elara’s craft. Spatial choreography holds; the telescope beam’s path is tracked. The setting constrains choice—timelessness enables lingering—but could more actively pressure the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach oneself to bloom again—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elara folds the stencil into action, gifting Lira. Cost is oblique: Elara’s grief softens, but no tangible price is paid on-page. Agency is present but leans charitable rather than sacrificial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through shared vulnerability emerges via craft and cosmos, never sermonized. The stencil’s vine-to-constellation motif reweights subtly at closure. Subtext operates in the silent hand-off of the lotus. Avoids tidy moral yet flirts with sentimental glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, textured with metallic and astral diction. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with grief’s cadence, though occasional elevated phrasing (“subdued ardor”) edges ornate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with purposeful repetition of “wilt/wither/bloom” that accumulates meaning. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. Minor scaffold: “grief-worn skin” and “shadowed cameos” verge on stock. Final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Combines mourning jewelry, cosmic origami, and time-bent observatory into a fresh constellation of grief-work. Tropes are personalized through Elara’s craft. The stencil’s transformation into star-mapped lotus feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is moderate; concept fully commits.</comment>
