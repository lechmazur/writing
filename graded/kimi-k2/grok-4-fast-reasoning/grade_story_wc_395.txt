<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to find deleted truths is crisp and consistent, but the interior contradiction between her role as “memory keeper” and her active deception never quite surfaces under pressure, flattening her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Orion-7 breadcrumb trail (recurring numbers → coordinates → patch) forms a clean causal spine; the final archival act lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>“Sensed absence” is evoked through sonic echoes and server hums, but the archive itself never constrains a specific choice; micro-setting details are vivid yet ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovery of the crew’s erased backup—tightens through each beat; the lie to the system narrows options and articulates the cost, though escalation plateaus near the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus corporate erasure emerges from concrete events rather than lecture; the closing image of archiving the patch quietly reprices the value of memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, corporate-toned, and specific; occasional lyric compression (“ghosts in the machine”) serves pressure rather than clutter, with no POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic control in server-hall descriptions alternates between mechanical pulse and synth silence; hyper-density is avoided, though a few stock stems (“terabytes of forgotten data”) creep in.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Turning a routine audit into a covert excavation of a lost space mission feels fresh; the specific synthesis of viral ballad and crash coordinates is non-obvious and earned.</comment>
