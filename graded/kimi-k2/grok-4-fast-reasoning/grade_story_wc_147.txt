<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her memories surface through sensory triggers rather than exposition. The contradiction between panic and deliberate calm is dramatized in the kelp sequence. Final choice to reseal the vial and pulse the beacon is earned by prior micro-choices. Minor slip: “diagnostic label-speak” in “harness the ephemeral” could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: vial uncorked → hush released → memories flood → kelp triggered → calm override → escape. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward impermanence crystallizes as she pockets the vial and re-signals. Cost is felt—air nearly gone, isolation intact. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Underwater temple is tactile—coral-veiled columns, silt clouds, kelp snares—each detail pressures action. Light shafts and salt-laced scent filter through POV bias. Crystal vial functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—survival vs. capturing impermanence—tightens as oxygen drops. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: uncorking vial, then overriding panic to unsnarl kelp. One meaningful deepening when memory of untangling nets reframes tactics. Cost legible: seconds of air traded for artifact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of transience emerges from concrete events: vial’s evaporated perfume, vanishing memories, escaping temple’s collapse. No explicit statement; final smile is earned resonance. Subtext in kelp’s “ephemeral grace” mirrors human surrender. Avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature vivid (“fractured shafts, gilding the ruins”). No head-hopping. Syntax flexes with stress—short clauses under kelp, languid fragments in memory flash. Voice coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language purposeful (“crystal facets like captured starlight”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“lonesome splendor”) fits lyric mode. One mixed metaphor—“weight pressing on body and hope”—minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of memory-extracting perfume vial in drowned temple feels fresh; trope of haunted artifact is transformed through sensory specificity. Synthesis of diving peril and philosophical quest is non-obvious. Risk taken with quiet, lyrical ending pays off.</comment>
