<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the tuning fork while fearing the silence—are embodied in micro-choices (striking the fork, scanning his own heat-map) that visibly cost him sweat and tremor. The final duet with Lira crystallizes an earned stasis: he accepts perpetual silence as the price for communal resonance. No diagnostic label-speak; emotions are shown through gesture and thermal flare.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each heat-map and fork-strike layers density until the final chord reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s private trauma transmuted into collective harmony—whose cost is the irreversible silence outside. Causality holds; no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is not backdrop but instrument: its bioluminescent vines sync to sub-sonic frequencies, literally constraining how Elias can “play” emotions. Spatial choreography is clean—door, alcove, dome—and the cold outside versus warm within charges the final image of silent snow versus vibrating glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform silence into shared music. Pressure tightens through each heat-map scan and fork-strike; the reds of trauma must modulate to amber or the community fractures. The final chord is earned by Elias’s agency, exacting the cost of perpetual personal exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as fertile void, music as communal scar tissue. The tuning fork’s velvet-lined case and the crimson-to-amber heat-maps form a returning image that reweights meaning at the end—music born of silence, beauty of shared fracture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—sound felt in bone, color seen as temperature. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior is inferred only through gesture. Syntax tightens under stress: “Sweat beaded on his brow; the silence amplified every internal echo.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“brass relic,” “velvet-lined,” “jagged reds spiking”—each noun/verb pair advances character or atmosphere. No mixed metaphors; the winterglass dome “pulse[ing] with the music’s subtle force” is coherent within the established physics of sub-sonic resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The post-apocalyptic silence trope is inverted: catastrophe is not spectacle but acoustic erasure. The heat-map-to-fork interface feels fresh, inevitable in hindsight, and the risk—using personal trauma as communal score—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity (tuning fork etched with A, bioluminescent vines) anchors universals.</comment>
