<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza’s grief-rooted drive to “magnify small kindnesses” is embodied in her tactile handling of the ledger and the final resolve to transcribe Josiah’s story; the interior contradiction between retreat and engagement is dramatized rather than labeled. Yet the moment of change—her heart “stirred” by the button—leans on summary rather than a fresh micro-choice, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain (dust pattern → hidden flap → letter → transcription) lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eliza’s stance shifts from passive archivist to active custodian, foreclosing her escape into anonymity. Closure is legible and earned, though the leap from private grief to public act could be more textured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Freedmen’s Bureau basement is rendered through humid warped ledgers, barred light, and brass button—details that constrain movement and mood. The dust itself becomes a semi-sentient guide, charging the final image when Eliza “steps back” into altered air.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Eliza will remain buried in her own sorrow or surface to honor others’ losses—tightens when the letter reveals Josiah’s forfeiture of his pay for Lila’s future. The escalation is coherent but compressed; one more beat of friction would sharpen the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet, unhistoric kindness emerges through Josiah’s whittled doll and pressed flowers, never sermonized. The final image of archives “exhaling” offers a non-literal answer: memory kept alive is itself mercy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eliza’s perceptual filter—ink-stained fingers, dust motes as “secretive script.” No head-hopping; diction is period-apt without caricature. Occasional elevated phrasing (“tactfully hopeful”) edges toward editorial commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid, with rhythmic variation and sensory specificity. Minor loop—“dust motes danced…dust had formed delicate swirls”—dilutes momentum slightly. No figurative muddle at the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Reconstruction archive as emotional battleground feels fresh; the dust-as-guide conceit is inventive without gimmickry. The premise could risk sentimentality but is grounded in Josiah’s specific sacrifice.</comment>
