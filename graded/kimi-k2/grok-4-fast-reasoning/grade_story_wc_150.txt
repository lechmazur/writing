<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Warmly-curious curiosity fuels every beat; embodied emotion in “hands callused from sifting soil” grounds interiority.  No contradictory impulses shown in-scene, and final restoration is only summarized, not dramatized with visible cost, keeping her change declarative rather than earned-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of dig-find-rebuild tightens toward the sundial restoration.  Closure lands as Charged Poise—“quiet enchantment of continuity”—but cost is only asserted (“lost faith reignited”) without an on-page forfeiture or image that makes the price legible; thus RR is present yet under-charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is tactile and specific: roots “cradled” the relic, soil “laced with history’s fragile whispers.”  Spatial choreography clean; environment steers action—roots contract during tremor, fog halts dig—qualifying for 9+ gate.  Final image, however, omits sensory return from that setting, so constraint does not fully charge the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—echoes early; each artifact found tightens the metaphorical dig.  No visible price paid (no injury, tool breakage, or social cost on-page), so escalation feels cumulative rather than costly.  Final tightening is aesthetic, not tactical, keeping tension solid but not piercing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of resuming interrupted journeys emerges through shards, amulet, sundial—never sermonized.  Ambiguity is preserved: faith restored is “quiet,” not triumphant.  Final paragraph risks thematic echo (“journeys no longer forever interrupted”) yet avoids literal moral, letting image carry reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual skew: “cautious enchantment,” foreign-honed questions.  Rhythm leans toward lyrical repetition (“purposeful wandering,” “interrupted journeys”) that matches accumulative design, but cadence flattens in late sentences, losing stress-time variation under final pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong noun-verb pairs (“roots snaked between skeletal remains”) and varied paragraphing.  Filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she envisioned”) soften immediacy; occasional stacked adjectives (“sun-baked valley,” “shadowed dance”) flirt with overwriting without pattern payoff.  No loops near closure, but figurative density remains high unearned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard + diaspora return + sundial grafts fresh geology onto exile trope.  Risk is moderate: no structural experiment, but concept intersection feels inevitable in hindsight.  Could swap “amulet” or “pottery shards” without ripple, showing some parts still generic.</comment>
