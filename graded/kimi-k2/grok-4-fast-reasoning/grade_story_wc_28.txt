<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—gentle empathy vs. steel-clad resolve—drives every beat; the retrocognitive visions are embodied (kneeling, palm on stone, breath fogging) rather than abstract. Her forgiveness of the arsonists is dramatized as a micro-choice that costs her residual hatred, supplying visible price. Minor slip: “gentle radical” is named but never translated into idiosyncratic speech or gesture, so the label hovers above the skin instead of living in it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: the plaza’s renaming reweights the fire’s legacy from curse to caution, cost felt in the survivors’ hesitant emergence. Causal chain holds: tessera vision → ritual discovery → rename → vines/crowd response. Accumulative lens is taught early and honored; no orientation debt. One beat of convenient off-stage plant growth is forgiven because Elara’s prior agency sets the conditions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shattered sky and soot-slick flagstones remain tactile, bias-filtered through Elara’s retrocognitive hunger; the tessera’s chipped veins act as micro-setting that literally guides her incantation. Spatial choreography is immaculate—kneeling, palm warming, crowd emerging from shadows. Environment constrains the final choice: only the plaza’s mosaic provides the map for the rename, so the setting is indispensable to tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect empathy without letting it devour her—tightens when the vision reveals the fire was born of the same empathy; the rename forecloses vengeance as a live option. Single meaningful escalation suffices: knowledge of the fire’s origin forces her to absorb its burden rather than externalize blame. Cost is legible in the warm-cold tremor of her voice and the vines’ slow reclaim of ruin. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the crowd arrives as resonance, not rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: mercy becomes aberrant when it forgives the unforgivable, yet that act reforges community. The rename’s reweighting of “curse to caution” supplies the resonant non-literal answer without sermon. No thematic echo sentence; instead, the tessera’s subtle mend under her palm declares the thesis. Complexity remains—survivors’ wary eyes admit the risk of relapsing into fire—so ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person floats tightly over Elara’s sensorium; diction (“warm coldness,” “auroras of ash”) stays within her lyric-ritual register. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for retrocognitive drift, clipped fragments for the incantation. No head-hopping; survivors’ reactions are externally observed, maintaining distance control. Psychic distance clean; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid mechanical patterns. High density—single sentences fold image, memory, and bodily action (“Her fingers lingered on the irregularities that formed an ancient script”). One paraphrase loop—“warm coldness” repeated three times—deducts 0.3; otherwise zero scaffold. Mixed metaphor check: “arms of steel” beside “breeze through thorns” reads as intentional contradiction rather than muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Retrocognitive placental-ritual rename is fresh; combines memory-as-curse and linguistic healing without genre cliché. Transformation test fails if you swap names/places because the tessera’s specific veins encode the ritual. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: closure image of vines cradling cold hearths is earned. Slight proximity to “Broken Earth” sky-wound trope, but caliph-workshop detail and aberrant mercy twist it past echo.</comment>
