<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the carousel while scavenging its ruins—are embodied in her calloused grip and damp pockets. The ghost’s accusation crystallizes her internal split, and her final bargain shows earned change with visible cost. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “chronologically confused” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara trades collected fragments for a chance to re-weave her own story, accepting the cost of never reclaiming the lost wheel. Causal chain—abandon wheel → haunt of regret → fragment barter—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is taught early via the floating lagoon. One micro-transition (ghost’s appearance) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon’s anti-gravity water and suspended droplets constrain every step; the carousel’s rusted poles and splintered platform become tactile tools for scavenging. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under crisis. Final image of mist-charged stillness reweights the setting as both cage and canvas. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage meaning from halted motion—tightens when the ghost demands restitution. One decisive deepening: fragment barter narrows options from retrieval to re-creation. Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the irretrievable wheel and the acceptance of erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as mosaic, regret as raw material. Subtext in the ticket-stub’s whisper and the gear’s hiss reframes ambition as communal residue. Final image of ghostly nod offers non-literal absolution without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical compression and patterned repetition (“fractured stillness,” “suspended regrets”) teach the reader the lagoon’s cadence. POV remains single and stable; ghost’s voice is an external echo, not head-hop. Syntax mirrors Elara’s slowed perception under anti-gravity. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “droplets hung mid-air like suspended regrets” fuses image and theme. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or texture. Figurative language is disciplined, never purple. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt”) in one beat keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The floating carousel-as-memory-lab is a fresh synthesis of steampunk and afterlife myth. Risky lyric structure pays off when fragments reassemble into closure. Specificity of ticket-stub and gear prevents generic allegory. Transformation test passed: story collapses if lagoon or carousel is swapped out.</comment>
