<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s zen calm and “phototropic” kindness are stated more than dramatized; the lantern-vision beat shows micro-choice (holding the glass steady) but no contradictory impulse under pressure, so interiority stays flat. The final insight arrives as summary, not embodied cost—no felt residue in hands or stance—so the arc reads observational rather than crucible-forged. Character functions adequately for an allegorical vignette, but lacks the contradiction or stakes-tested flaw required for high-band interiority.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the oasis’s secret (sustained compassion = active resistance) reweights the premise with conceptual cost—Elias leaves “with the will to resist his own unraveling,” a Charged Poise. Causal chain is thin—vision gifts insight rather than forcing a decision—but under Accumulative/Textural lens the final thrum recalibrates earlier pattern, satisfying RR. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props or logic breaks. Still, the decisive change is internal and un-tested by new action, capping excellence.</comment>

<comment>Desert-as-body micro-setting is vivid: ash dunes, dew-crusted thorn blooms, chimney smoke flattening against sky—each image performs double duty, mirroring internal state and guiding Elias’s notice. Spatial choreography holds as he kneels, lifts, rises; the lantern glass serves as portable “setting” that later constrains perception. Sensory economy is strong; no museum-tour drift. Environment never actively endangers or resource-shapes tactics, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Central stake—why places endure—threads early and tightens through lantern visions, but pressure is observational: Elias watches timelines rather than risking anything tangible. No option narrows; no visible price (lost water, broken pottery, delayed journey) attaches to the insight, so escalation stays intellectual. Sufficient for short-form thematic piece, yet lacks the felt constraint or trade-off demanded at 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: persistence-through-tending versus surrender-through-neglect. Final image of potter-hands “itching for clay” recharges the motif without moralizing. Subtext stays restrained—no thesis statement—though “sharp gentleness” edges toward prompt-echo. Complexity is present but not deepened by character contradiction; hence very good, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric maintains disciplined compression: “dunes of ash whispered forgotten secrets” signals textured distance suitable to zen observer. Syntax modulates—long breath-like clauses for calm, fragment shards for visions—without losing clarity. No register drift or filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature distinct; rhythm supports momentum and closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Line craft is lean and rhythmic; mixed metaphor rare, no synonym loops. One minor scaffold: “sharp gentleness” repeated as label rather than evolving image. Final sentences carry dual duty—closure plus cadence—propelling exit. High density achieved; artifact-free enough for elite tier, if not flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Post-apicultural oasis + zen potter + timeline fracture merges into fresh constellation; trope inversion feels inevitable in hindsight. Core insight (kindness as structural resistance) offers non-obvious moral calculus. Risk resides in abstract stakes, but specificity of beekeeper relics grounds it. Near-echo of “places resist change” thematic could feel prompt-bound, limiting total surprise.</comment>
