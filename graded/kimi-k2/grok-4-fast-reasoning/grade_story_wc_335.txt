<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gut-punch interiority: Elara’s reflexive heel-scraping recoil, calloused fingertip on tea-leaf fractals, the soft-blade “It doesn’t” all die-cast her combative tenderness. Lir’s arc from cornered-animal flinch to nod that loosens the shadow is micro-observed without label-speak. The final forward step pays the exile cost she hoarded—resilience mentored is resilience spent—under the inferred causal lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Decisive Change: Lir exits, shadow slackened; Elara’s backward gait flips forward—felt cost visible in “resilience mentored and returned.” Causal chain holds: exile geometry → tea-map → annotated shard → reversal. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by word 84; no amnesia or teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices; off-stage council exile is woven into present spell-test without retro-fix.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shard-mirrors, tea steam, and the jagged glass pane that snags afternoon shadow are tactile tools that constrain the annotation ritual and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is_clean: lectern bump, corner huddle, table ritual, exit door trackable. “Hush as an empty playground swing” micro-sets temporal mood without clutter. Environment dictates method (tea-leaf geometry) and stakes (reversible exile etched in glass).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversible exile—signaled in title phrase and crystallizes when glass shadow pulses. Single meaningful tightening: tea-trace narrows infinite paths to one outward arc, foreclosing Lir’s doubt. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elara chooses to mentor, annotates, hands over charged shard; shadow recedes as direct result. Cost legible: her own exile test completes only when pupil walks free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience versus reflection emerges through recurrent mirroring (glass, tea leaves, mentor/mentee) that reweights at closure: mentor becomes forward-walker. No moralizing; final image of Elara’s reversed steps speaks wordlessly. Subtext resides in gesture—handing the shard equals handing back identity. Shadow-as-doubt motif shifts from trap to released possibility without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyric, compressed diction (“dust motes danced like forgotten memories”) stays inside Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Fragments and em-dash blade-lines mirror her combative tenderness. Patterned elision—tea ritual mechanics taught by showing one pour/settle/trace—remains legible. Voice modulates: combative curtness under stress, soft maternal cadence at release, climax in spare forward-step image.</comment>

<comment>Sentences perform double duty (action + atmosphere) without scaffold; no synonym loops. Metaphors stay coherent—shadow, swing, glass, tea spirals interlock under geometry motif. Strong verbs (“snagged,” “scraping,” “loosening”) replace modifiers. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during bump-lectern beat, then exhales at final line. Clean grammar and pronoun tracking across two-character scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Shard-mirror archive plus tea-leaf cartography feels fresh, not stock fantasy; exile as etched reversible geometry is conceptual risk that pays off. Specificity of method (acute vs curved leaf angles) prevents generic oracle trope. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the mirror-tea-mentor causal spine collapses. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; no derivative-premise penalty applied.</comment>
