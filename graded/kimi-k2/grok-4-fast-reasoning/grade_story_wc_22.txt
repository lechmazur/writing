<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Elias’s quiet, fierce motive (“let a garden reclaim this battlefield”) is the engine of every beat; his ritual scattering of seed-dust dramatizes an internal contradiction between enduring guilt and stubborn hope. Embodied micro-choices—kneeling, cracking pods, murmuring extinct syllables—keep interiority concrete; no therapeutic self-labeling. The ending’s Earned Stasis (he forecloses retreat, accepts the fragile sprouts as sufficient cost) is fully prepared by the satchel’s weight and the hermit-taught tongues. Only absence of a second on-page character keeps relationship crucible untested, capping short of 9.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the jetty narrows to a bridge of fragile greens, undeniable conceptual cost paid in salt-scarred planks and spilled volcanic dust. Causal chain holds—because reef died / therefore birds guide / therefore Elias fertilizes—without gaps or convenient amnesia. One legible shard, continuous scene, orientation anchored by word 80 (“Elias, bearer of shadows…”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative/textural pattern taught early and held to final whistle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Jetty’s splintered wood, salt-crevices, and erupting blooms function as micro-setting that physically constrains where seed-dust can lodge; the blooming flowers literally lean closer during fertilization, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s priors: carriage creak, wheel crunch, dusky sea-breath on neck—no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; horses, planks, circling shadows track clean across the single scene. Environment, body (calloused fingers), and tool (seed pods) together shape tactics and final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will salt-death or green-resilience win—signals in line 3 and tightens when birds steer him to “deepest wounds.” One meaningful deepening: birds’ calls shift from ambient noise to rhythmic affirmation, reweighting cost of failure. Agency sits entirely with Elias; no coincidence resolves. Price is legible: volcanic dust spent, linguistic breath expended, future stewardship assumed. Could edge higher if a visible external obstacle (e.g., remaining ordnance) had threatened the last gesture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation versus erasure emerges through seed-to-sprout arc and dead-language-to-living-whistle cycle; no editorial commentary required. Subtext operates in gesture—flowers “lean closer” as silent witnesses to restitution. Final image of “bridge to renewal” reweights earlier battlefield blood without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: renewal is tentative, salt still present, avoiding tidy triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person POV stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction—“bruised purples,” “mute expanse”—mirrors his mournful lyricism. No head-hopping; birds’ intent is inferred solely through his extinct-linguistic lens. Rhythm modulates: long sea-swell sentences calm, then fragment during seed-cracking. Filter verbs (“he realized”) appear only when they dramatize interpretive effort, not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, pressure, or stakes. Figurative vehicles stay coherent—coral bones, volcanic dust—without mixed-metaphor clutter. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line whistles cost back into air. High density achieved through noun-verb specificity (“wheels crunch over shells,” “dust spilled”) rather than modifier pile-up.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar eco-restoration frame is re-angled through dead-language ornithomancy and volcanic seed alchemy—specific, non-obvious synthesis. Elias’s coachman-gardian hybrid identity feels singular, not archetype. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off: reef-corpse to bloom transition is credible within its own mythic logic. Transformation test fails if relocated away from Gloom Hill’s volcanic soil and drowned concord, proving necessity of invented particulars.</comment>
