<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s contradictory impulses—yearning to keep her twin alive while knowing the heartbeat is borrowed—are embodied in her careful song-codes and the tremor in her touch. The final renunciation (accepting the heartbeat’s release) is earned by the escalating mirror visions and costs her last illusion of control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The causal chain is tight: borrowed heartbeat → coded lullabies → mirror visions → acceptance of loss. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrors now pulse with “a heartbeat, borrowed no more,” reweighting the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>The prism parapet refracts both light and stakes, its slick surface forcing Elowen’s literal and figurative balance; the terrace’s echoes amplify her song into spell. The final refraction captures the freed heartbeat, charging the closing image.</comment>

<comment>Pressure tightens once: each coded lullaby narrows the possible futures until only release remains. The cost—letting the borrowed beat go—becomes visible in the mirror’s last shimmer.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the tension between illusion and impermanence; the lullabies’ gentle codes carry the brutal truth that borrowed life cannot stay. The ending offers no moral, only the charged image of a heart freed into spring night.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating from hush to bell-toll without slackening. The perceptual signature—petals whispering, prism “shattered rainbows”—remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and musical, each sentence layering sensory detail and forward motion; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“melancholic symphony”) fits the lyric mode.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of nursery-rhyme code with necromantic longing feels fresh; the prism-terrace as spell-casting instrument is a novel micro-setting. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final heartbeat image.</comment>
