<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition and olfactory sensitivity are embodied in every beat—her nausea at the bloom’s stench, her kneeling to journalize, her refusal to flee. Contradictory impulses (revulsion vs. resolve) act simultaneously in scene, culminating in an earned renunciation of pure ambition for tempered wisdom. The cost—her sensory torment and recalibrated ambition—is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by ~120 words; causality is tight: seed acquired → cultivated → bloom assault → journalize → stance shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stench becomes teacher, serenity redefined as embrace of motion. Cost is legible—“eyes watering, gut knotted”—and shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The treetop village is vivid yet selective: creaking bridges, salt-kissed mist, hollowed-trunk basin. Environment constrains choice—height and sway dictate where she can kneel to draw, the bloom’s odor is trapped in canopy air. Final image of wilted petals against vine-latticed dusk recharges the setting as both threat and teacher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she master the flower without losing her calm?—is signaled early. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each whiff intensifies the assault until the tide-turn moment forces a stance crystallization. Agency is her decision to endure and journalize; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: serenity is not stillness but rooted motion. Subtext lives in gesture—her trembling hand steadying only when sketching decay. Final image of “serenity in motion” is earned, not stated, and invites counter-readings about the cost of wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Sensory signature is distinct—scents “paint stories,” decay “claws.” Rhythm modulates with stress: long lyrical lines calm, staccato bursts under assault. No filter-verb stacks; prose is character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—“reek of decay,” “fertile decay birthing life.” Metaphors are coherent and grounded. Sentence rhythm mirrors breathing: swelling descriptions, then clipped gasps under stench. No artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar herbalist trope is transformed through olfactory sensitivity and the corpse-flower twist. The “journal on wrapping paper” custom feels fresh and inevitable. Risk—using a stench as teacher—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
