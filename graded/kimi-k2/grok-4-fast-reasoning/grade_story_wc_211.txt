<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the drum of his heart—but the “archive emotional patterns” motive is asserted more than dramatized. The childhood theft and lifelong vow create a credible through-line, yet the final beat of pressing the shaving to his chest feels slightly abstract rather than embodied. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the prophecy’s cost is felt when Elias realizes the city’s oaths—and his own—will unravel. The causal chain (immersion → awakening → recognition → acceptance) is intact, and the childhood memory is anchored to the present via the wax shaving. Orientation is secure by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is tactile—mossy paths, rainwater basin, roots in concrete—and the apple glow at the end recharges the image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. The garden constrains the ritual and supplies the sap that unlocks the prophecy, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving emotional oaths—faces a single decisive tightening: the prophecy reveals inevitable fracture. Elias’s agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than prevention, and the cost is the loneliness he must now bear. Pressure escalates via the immersion act and the dead-language utterance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: memory as both archive and prison, the price of binding others’ feelings while neglecting one’s own. Subtext surfaces in the orchard’s “velvet disquiet” and the foghorn’s silence. No overt moralizing; the final image of glowing apples offers quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled—“velvet disquiet,” “loamy breath”—with rhythmic variation that mirrors Elias’s hush and drum. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the dead-language prophecy is rendered without italic gimmicks. POV remains stable and perceptually specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density, minimal loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant relic,” “genie’s wish”) stays within Elias’s scholarly register. No clarity issues or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The skyscraper Eden and phonograph-shaving ritual feel fresh, synthesizing steampunk and eco-myth without cliché. The childhood theft seeding a lifelong vocation is a non-obvious origin. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
