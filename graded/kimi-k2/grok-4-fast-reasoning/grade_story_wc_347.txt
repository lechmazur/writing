<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant-caretaker identity is vivid in scene-level micro-choices (expert nut-trace planning, self-deprecating errors) and motivates every beat; internal contradiction visible but occasionally lapses into abstract self-labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Solid causal spine: labyrinth escape narrows options (frost clock) → nut blueprint activation → mechanical-bird recalibration → safe passage. Closure unit lands on-page with visible cost (curse loosening, inherited role accepted).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cliffside paths, orchard thorns, brass-winged birds anchor every choice; micro-setting uses a small rolling nut as navigational node. Early signal and payoff maintain pressure, specificity, and coherent choreography across the maze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide family vs orchard curse—escalates via frost-clock tightening and mechanical-bird re-route. One decisive reconfiguration (birds from predators to shepherds) with visible price: Elara’s future tied tighter to orchard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—reluctant duty vs desire for freedom—surfaces in embodied action (tripping over roots yet placing nuts) without tidy moral; final graceless-beauty image reweights the curse without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight, rhythmic, and distinct in perceptual signature (brass wings glinting “offhandedly exact”). No head-hopping; interiority avoids therapy-speak and shows contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose has vivid, economical specificity; zero loops or scaffold. One metaphor string too dense in the orchard whisper section, but rhythmic control under pressure remains strong and aids momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar “reluctant guardian of cursed orchard” trope is refreshed by mechanical-bird recalibration device and nut-based navigation; synthesis feels inevitable, minor risk-taking increases stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
