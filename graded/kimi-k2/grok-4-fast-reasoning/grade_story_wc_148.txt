<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his pulse aligning with the grooves of the door scuffs crystallizes the inherited burden. The final renunciation (“I am not my father’s echo”) is earned by the tactile confrontation with the lattice and the ghost-map. Flaws (the compulsion to overwrite legacy) actively complicate his choices. Cost is felt in the lighter yet irreversible inheritance he now carries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elias threads his own story through the lattice, reweighting the fable’s meaning. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each echoing image (scuffs, lattice, copperlight) layers density until the final cadence releases it. Orientation is anchored by the skiff’s approach and the reef’s teeth within the first 120 words. Causality holds: the confession rewrites the curse, and the door swings wider as tangible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison, reef, and copperlight are not backdrop but instruments: the reef’s jagged teeth mirror Elias’s inherited guilt; the extinguished beacon cages stories. Sensory selection is urgent—salt-etched walls, cracked porthole, cool lattice wood—filtered through Elias’s need for silence. Spatial choreography is flawless: skiff → rusted rung → spiral → chamber → skiff again. The setting constrains the final choice and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation from paternal fable—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens as Elias ascends, each whispered denial narrowing his options to either perpetuate or rewrite the lie. The decisive act is the kneeling confession; its cost is the irreversible fusion of his story with the lighthouse’s bones. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal and fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories can either drown or save, depending on who wields them. Subtext lives in gesture—the lattice absorbing warmth, the door widening—not exposition. The final image of rowing toward a horizon with the wolf “long tamed into repose” offers a non-literal, resonant answer. No moral is stated; the copperlight itself becomes judgment and absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Third-person limited adheres strictly to Elias’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Voice is textured, maritime, and slightly archaic (“copperlight,” “reposeful glow”) without slipping into pastiche. Syntax mirrors the spiral ascent—long sentences that tighten into shorter, breathless fragments at the climax. Dialogue is absent, a choice that amplifies the hush Elias seeks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors—and serves the maritime lexicon. Rhythm accelerates during the climb, then exhales in the final paragraph. Zero loops, zero filler; even the repeated “repose” is reweighted at closure. Line-level control is near flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>The conceit of a lighthouse turned prison for “men who chased shadows” is fresh, and the lattice-confessional salvaged from a wrecked chapel ship is a brilliant, specific invention. The inversion of the wolf fable—son rewriting the father’s lethal lie—transforms a familiar trope into something urgent and new. Risk is taken with lyric density, yet coherence never falters. The final image feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
