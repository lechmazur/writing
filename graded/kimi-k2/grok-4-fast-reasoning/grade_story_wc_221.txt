<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara reads vividly—her heightened temporal sensitivity dramatizes interior conflict, each tremor of compass-driven perception embodies both gift and exile—and her earned shift from pariah’s isolation to deliberate explorer anchors the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV coheres; sketch feed links past sky to time-dilated present, causal trail from mourning ritual to glimpse-scene reconfiguration is airtight; dilation haze→mother payoff lands with conceptual repricing under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dock details—starlight refracted, console hum, compass warmth—tighten choice: viewport positioning enables snapshot glimpse; dilation field itself acts as embodied constraint; gilded rose engravings function as micro-setting stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Primary stake: mapping confusion into forward motion; each beat escalates pressure—sketch tradition vs temporal stretch—culminating in silhouette mother glimpse that redefines stakes and costs legacy access.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of navigation through disorientation emerges from concrete choices—not slogans—ending recharges “true north” from abstract theme to urgent decision: chart past vs claim future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression suits temporal sensitivity—“echoed silence” cadence tracks dilation stretch; filter verbs minimal; mother’s sketch echo crystallizes via free-indirect memory without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive; each sentence advances goal or atmosphere; no looped scaffolding; final image of silhouette dissolving feeds back with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grieving ritual + time-dilated ghost sighting feels inevitable; temporal distortion used not as gimmick but as crucible for family reconciliation.</comment>
<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Pariah choice crystallizes at glimpse—her sketch becoming seek-path, loosening isolation—though middle beat usage is limited to reflex reaction, not active tactic shift.</comment>
<question>9 B</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Compass rose reprises twice: chain-of-custody setup, then final latitude toward mother silhouette; its warm petals act as road sign that forces viewport focus.</comment>
<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>“True north” shifts from abstract moral to navigational tactic: coordinates pulled from hidden chip dictate new route to ghost, turning thematic compass to plot driver.</comment>
<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Temporally stretched perception constrains two choices—elongated time assists glimpse capture, but no visible trade-off beyond awe—cost not dramatized.</comment>
<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Glimpse is story hinge: silhouette mother replaces star-map sketch goal; non-swappable, event reframes legacy, not just hallucination.</comment>
<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Anniversary custom signals early but mid-section sketching is summary, not tactic; mechanic finally delivers coordinates only in payoff—partial development.</comment>
<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Observation deck pressures body via dilation field—time stretch affects reaction speed; resource two-way viewport angle enables glimpse capture.</comment>
<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Post-shutdown mark looms as motivation yet clock not tracked; beats unfold as dilation feels, not seconds counted—temporal stakes hinted but loose.</comment>
<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Pariah’s “turn confusion into exploration” drives viewport activation, log activation, and reconciliation with ghost; desire constantly frictioned against guilt and cost.</comment>
<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Echoed silence intensifies with each dilation hush, modulates from grief to reverent discovery; chord shift in final silhouette dissolve charges ending with resonant quiet.</comment>
