<comment>Elara feels layered—lunar-eclipse locksmith premise drives her solitude, fear of sorrow, and compulsive need to mend. Interior contradiction between fixing locks and locking away feelings is embodied in mirror reflections. Protagonist passivity lifts only at uncapping; earlier meandering hurts urgency. Final uncapping choice earns renunciation of her former stance with visible cost (synced heartbeat timepiece).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Structure follows causal arc: inciting ache, artefact hunt, hall-of-mirrors escalation, decisive uncapping, synchronous timepiece restart. Closure beats assemble prophecy scraps into Resonant Reconfiguration—timepiece syncing her breath teaches universal repair rhythm. Orientation anchors early (who/where/when by paragraph 3). Minor mosaic drift: library/hall sequence could tighten with one transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vivid specificity in frozen library: frost-laced stairs etched with hoarfrost, crystalline fortress preserving volumes under eternal winter. Micro-setting—frozen timepiece at core frozen—functions as living constraint shaping repair tactics. Mirror panes refract spectral brightness into blinding prisms that constrain vision. Ice-sealed books avoid tourist-catalogue listing; each detail pressures later choices.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—learning repair rhythm—tightens through each beat: prophecies hint rhythm, hall forces alignment choice, timepiece restart demands synchronized cadence. Visible cost: she uncaps her literal heartbeat rhythm to the world. Escalation coheres under Causal lens (because/therefore linkage). No coincidences solve stakes; everything earns causality.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of repair as cosmic rhythm emerges from specific events: frozen mechanisms, mirror reflections, syncopated heartbeat—never stated, always enacted. Subtext in uncapping her own heartbeat redefines repair beyond surfaces. Final image (mirrors gleaming gentle sync) offers non-literal answer: mending is aligning with universal pulse. No moralizing; resonance built from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; mirror reflections refract her thousand selves with specific interiority (girl who once believed locks could cage sorrow). Driftwood-scented nostalgia filters perception without clichés. Voice in icy splinters and salt metaphors rooted in POV bias. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets unused. Rhythm accelerates toward uncapping as sentence lengths compress.</comment>

<comment>Prose is vivid, rhythmic, syntactically varied. Frozen imagery clusters but serves pressure (“mirrors shuddered, their hauntingly bright glow shifting”). A few boilerplate phrases (“soft hush of distant morning,” “weight of forgotten years”) slightly dilute density—nonetheless, high information-per-line. No loops or scaffold; each metaphor advances stakes or mood. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar-eclipse locksmith working frozen celestial clock is new angle on maker archetype. Mirror hall / driftwood nostalgia combo creates specific emotional signature. Risk of ornamental metaphor rarely indulged; transformation feels inevitable. Hall-of-mirrors trope refracted through her heartbeat beats monocultural use. Final image—mirrors dimming gentle gleam—charges driftwood nostalgia into earned resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Setup (introduced immediately), development (choices in hall and uncapping), payoff (heartbeat sync in final image). Lunar-eclipse trade shapes her solar-clock epiphany. Some early meandering before hall pressures choice; rise accordingly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Setup (carried early), development (mirrors aligned via gears), payoff (gears drive timepiece restart). Assortment constrains tactic of aligning reflections with brass cogs. Clockmaker inheritance reweights meaning when heart gear clicks.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Frames stakes (reflections mend dawn verse), shapes tactics (mirrors force alignment path), charges ending (hall turns gentle gleam). Concept over theme—misalignment is literal obstacle overcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Constrains visibility in mirror hall—spectral brightness blinds choice; cost is surrendering control of reflections. Use spans beats; drop score if only label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sets decisive turn: uncapping vial releases heartbeat chime, syncs mirrors; without this act, no rhythm alignment or closure. Irreplaceable beat driver.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prophecy scraps setup early, guide passage searches and mirror alignment choice. Mechanics matter—pieces reassemble into heartbeat verse. Some late summmary recitation minor friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting pressures choice—ice stiffens locks, forces gear tolerance precision, timepiece inside frozen. Merely backdrop without active use; development lifts score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Soft hush morning frames mood; not a ticking clock. Time constraint on page is minimal beyond poetic cadence; rise if live clock affected moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Desire dramatized through action—uncapping heartbeat to learn repair rhythm; tension in letting world sync her breath incurs cost. Friction between fixing vs being fixed visible in beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Driftwood nostalgia threads from early salt-and-sea apprenticeship to final mirror-gentle gleam. Tone modulates with pressure—cold crystalline to warm sync—without drifting.
