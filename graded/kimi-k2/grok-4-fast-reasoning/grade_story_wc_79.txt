<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet drive is embodied in tactile mapping and the final whistle act; her grief and resolve crystallize when she learns Thorne is now a watcher. Interiority stays concrete, though “sunwashed dread” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s choice to keep questioning reweights her world after the watchers’ revelation. Causal chain—gate rust → lost expedition → whistle query → answer in foam glyphs—holds cleanly under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>City-on-turtles is vivid and selective; shell-rim vantage constrains the final whistle act. Sensory hierarchy narrows to salt, sun, and groaning shells under crisis, anchoring who/where early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find Thorne—tightens when the watchers’ glyphs reveal his fate. One decisive escalation: whistle question → foam answer → irrevocable knowledge. Cost is felt in Elara’s grief-laced resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of forbidden knowledge and irreversible consequence emerges through shell-maps and watchers’ silence, never stated. Final image of “cracking vigil” invites reflection on whether pursuit frees or dooms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is textured (“brine-scented breeze,” “glyphs blooming in foam”). No head-hopping; voice modulates with heat and dread.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“golden haze that gilded rooftops”). One paraphrase loop near midpoint (“the turtles’ groans grew labored… the turtles groaned onward”) but no artifact touches closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>City-on-turtles and pattern-language whistle feel fresh, not gimmick; trope of lost expedition is transformed into ontological boundary breach. Specificity of shell cartography and whale-song whistle anchors the fantastical in lived detail.</comment>
