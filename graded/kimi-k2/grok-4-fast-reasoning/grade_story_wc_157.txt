<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s rogue charm and defiant spark are vivid, but interior contradiction is thin; the warp ritual is the only moment where desire and risk visibly collide. His charm is more posture than embodied flaw, so the final “guard” stance feels earned yet not deeply costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the planted gourd’s rattle becomes a living cipher, foreclosing capture. Causal chain is tight—seed → warp → drone baffled—but the initiation beat is slightly rushed, muting the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s humid density and insect cacophony constrain every move; vines snag coats, drone hum invades. Micro-setting (loamy soil, fogged lenses) is tactile and stakes-shaping, though spatial choreography could be sharper during the warp.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evade thought-tax and plant rebellion—is signaled early and tightened by drone approach. Agency is clear: Elias chooses warp, pays with exposure risk. One meaningful escalation, no reversals, cost legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of untaxed thought emerges through living glyphs and bio-alchemy, never sermonized. Final image—gourd rattling underground—reweights the premise: rebellion now grows itself. Subtext in Dr. Lira’s “plant what rattles the silent storm” lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, modulating from sly rogue cadence to incantatory warp rhythm. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s wary attention. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with purposeful repetition (“candidly cryptic”) that patterns rather than loops. Occasional lushness (“iridescent beetles swarmed in erratic spirals”) risks overwriting but stays tethered to POV urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tax-law dystopia meets botanical cryptography. The warp-seed cipher feels inevitable yet non-obvious, and the greenhouse-as-rebel-hive image is memorable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final rattle.</comment>
