<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elowen’s boredom-to-curiosity pivot is embodied (“heart… quickened”) and anchored in concrete micro-choices (lifting the shard, weaving magnetic lines). The contradiction between immortal ennui and sudden hunger for the “after” is dramatized, not declared, and the final smile carries visible cost: the shard’s spent heat in her palm forecloses immediate re-use. Interiority stays specific to her dimensional sight; no stock therapy labels intrude. The only slack is the late, single-sentence plan to “plot the next storm”—a tell that slightly blunts the earned poise.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elowen gains a charged new stance (“eternity… thrummed with possibility”) paid for by the shard’s spent burn and the sealed breach. Causal chain holds—boredom → storm → shard → mutiny → glimpse → cost—without jumps or retro-fixes. Orientation is fixed by word 40 (“prismatic escondite… hidden within the folds of reality”). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens the final image reweights all prior prismatic imagery; no lens contradiction at exit.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The escondite’s refracting walls, the shard’s obsidian/ crimson veins, and the storm’s violet-gold bleed are tactile, selective, and filter through Elowen’s dimensional senses. Spatial choreography is exact: shard half-buried in glowing dust, walls trembling, colors bleeding, fragment cooling in palm. Environment directly supplies the energy source that enables the breach, then seals it—meeting the 9+ gate by constraining tactics and charging the final after-glow.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates through one deepening: the mutiny’s crest offers a lived simulation of post-death transformation, narrowing her options from eternal drift to purposeful storm-chasing. Cost is legible: shard spent, breach sealed, boredom cracked. Agency resides in her intrigue-woven manipulation of magnetic lines; coincidence merely complicates. Sufficient for the high band under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: immortality’s curse is stasis, death’s gift is forward motion. The prismatic echo mutates from empty spectacle to promise of continual becoming; no authorial thesis states this—final smile and pulsing shard carry it. Ambiguity remains: mutinies never end, leaving plausible counter-readings about addictive pursuit versus true liberation. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; resonance is image-bound.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is dense, lyric, and consistent—long breathless cadences mimic immortal languor tightening into electric anticipation. Diction stays within a poet-immortal’s lexicon; no jarring register drift. Compressed elision (“spatial mutiny, she named it”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is distinct: colors tasted as hushed thunder, dimensions felt as threads. No dialogue to test, yet internal monologue avoids explanatory filler.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates—languid opening clauses accelerate into staccato glimpses during breach, mirroring emotional arc. Metaphors remain coherent (storm as heartbeat, prisms as lungs) without mixed collisions. High density: single sentences fuse sensory, emotional, and world data (“curse igniting through the magnetic torrent”). One scaffold pair detected (“colours bleeding into one another as the storm’s fields amplified”)—minor, does not touch closure; −0.2 applied. Otherwise no loops, jargon, or purple overload.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—bored immortal, cursed artifact—are re-engineered through dimensional wave-weaving and solar-storm physics, producing a non-obvious method for glimpsing post-death continuity. Specificity of “prismatic escondite” and “hushed thunder” makes the combo feel indigenous to this voice. Risk in lyric compression pays off: the final smile reframes eternity as iterative rebellion rather than static doom. Transformation test passes; generic swap would collapse the imagery and mechanic.</comment>
