<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias’s inventor-trait stays consistent, but interiority drifts into echoing abstracts (“safeguarding space for innovation” repeated) rather than fresh contradiction; no embodied emotion undercuts his calm. Micro-choice at the seed-planting is present yet cost remains prospective, not paid, so the beat feels safe. Relationship crucible is absent (single POV), within scope but limiting pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density of garden/flow imagery layers until the final “revolution” crystallizes options. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—his old rooms are now obsolete—so RR qualifies. Causality is loose between planting and business reinvention, but pattern holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm-soaked bank, cabin, and brook form a tactile micro-setting that constrains the lone action (kneeling to plant). Selective sensory triage (loam scent, water sound, starlight) mirrors protagonist’s narrowed attention. The recurring brook charges the final image: “mysteries flowed as freely as the brook,” tying environment to conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving creative edge—signaled early. Pressure intensifies once through the seed’s arrival, but no live option is foreclosed on-page; cost is deferred to future patrons. Escalation is tonal, not tactical, sufficient for short lyric arc under Accumulative lens yet short of visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-enigma emerges via organic imagery rather than thesis. Final image reweights earlier “stale puzzles” without moralizing. Subtext of decay-as-attraction (corpse-flower) lingers plausibly, inviting counter-readings on artistic risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person hovering close to Elias maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature favors synesthetic metaphors (“brook whispered secrets”) appropriate to puzzle-designer mind. Rhythm modulates with long accumulative clauses that mimic water flow; no head-hop. Diction stays within plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lush but purposeful description; some modifier stacks (“storm-born silence… velvet sky”) verge on purple yet pattern-taught early. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed cue: “orthogonal approaches” appears thrice with slightly different gloss—minor register drift, not closure-touching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusing titan-arum stench with escape-room design is fresh; horticulture-plus-cryptography angle feels inevitable to Elias. Story avoids tidy twist, opting for quiet conceptual pivot. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulative structure rather than causal pyrotechnics—but coherent.</comment>
