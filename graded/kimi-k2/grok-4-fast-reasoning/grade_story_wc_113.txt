<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with Isabella’s code is vivid and embodied—his trembling fingers, the bow tracing symbols—but the interior contradiction between curiosity and dread is only gestured at, not dramatized in a single decisive micro-choice. The final renunciation (accepting the half-known truth) is earned, yet the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the program dissolves, the veil reseals, and Elias stands in “heavier hush,” the cost being the irretrievable loss of the code. Causality is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the mood until the final image crystallizes the stakes.</comment>

<comment>The flooded opera house is rendered with tactile specificity—ankle-deep water, bobbing props, rusted lanterns—and these details actively constrain movement and sightlines. The setting evolves: rising water mirrors escalating tension, and the final tableau of spectral Isabella is charged by the very lanterns that earlier lit the pit.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unravel Isabella’s secret—is signaled early and tightened through each sensory beat. The single escalation occurs when Elias’s bow disrupts the veil, trading the chance for full knowledge for a fleeting glimpse; the price (code lost, mystery intact) is legible on the page.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of silenced voices and the ethics of resurrection emerges through image and action, never statement. The half-deciphered diary becomes a metaphor for incomplete justice; the final “heavier hush” invites reflection on what should stay buried.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—music as language, water as score. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer sinuous sentences in discovery, staccato fragments during the bow-stroke disruption. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective (“lanterns’ glow dancing on ripples”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“liminal realms”) is justified by Elias’s musical lexicon.</comment>

<comment>The ghost-code premise feels fresh because it fuses musicology, alchemy, and hauntology into one compressed space. The water-damaged program as palimpsest is a specific, non-generic device; removing it would collapse the entire discovery mechanism.</comment>
