<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory drive—nurturing connection only to sever it—remains embodied in every micro-choice; the final renunciation of Clara’s call lands with visible cost. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. One slip: “teach endings how to begin” edges toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s resolve to release her sister crystallizes through the wrong-number loop, cost paid in the severed friendship itself. Causal chain—call, intimacy, deliberate estrangement—holds under a Situational lens. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The tunnel’s damp, sodium-tinted gloom actively shapes Elias’s ritual; the glass disc’s glint and echo constrain his tactics. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through his estranging vocation. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Clara’s need for permission to let go—escalates via Elias’s guided spiral; the harmonica’s wail tightens the emotional vise. Agency remains with Clara’s final decision, cost unmistakable in the abandoned connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of necessary estrangement emerges from the wrong-number conceit and the harmonica’s ghost-notes, never stated outright. Final image—disc still vibrating—reweights the premise without moralizing. One minor echo: “teach endings how to begin” flirts with directness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is gravelly, tactile, consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s estranging craft. Dialogue carries subtext (“Lost Lines, where do you need to go?”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, rhythms mirroring the tunnel’s pulse. Occasional lyrical flourish (“ghosts whispering secrets of separation”) stays within POV lexicon. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The wrong-number friendship as ritual estrangement feels fresh, synthesized through Elias’s specific underground vocation. Risky premise commits fully; no retreat to safer tropes. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
