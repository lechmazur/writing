<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elar’s “strangely honest” trait is embodied in the exposed eye and refusal to grandstand; interiority stays concrete (“admitting the fear that the echo might slip away”). Motivation is steady—anchor the wisdom—yet the beat structure is one long circling ritual rather than a rising choice sequence, so the final consecration feels predetermined, not hard-won. No contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; he simply succeeds. Still, the sensory-bodied attention and occupational nuance lift him well above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the consecrated echo now “carried a new timbre,” a reconfiguration legible in the final hush. Causal chain is slender—prophet arrives → echo fading → Elar circles → consecration succeeds—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each clearing thickens ambience and stakes until the pavilion’s hush repitches. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the world is “a fraction wiser,” a social repricing that satisfies the lens. Orientation is complete by line 4; no teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Whisperfield, pavilion silks, and the buried kinetic parapet are filtered through Elar’s line-walker sensorium—sand “parting like reluctant curtains,” parapet “rippling with captured storms.” Micro-setting (mask fabric, sand against ankles) constrains movement; the parapet’s kinetic pulse literally powers the consecration, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and hearing over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate across 360° circling. Minor over-richness (“breaths caught in eternal suspension”) but never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through each summoned clearing. Pressure is ambient, not adversarial: time and entropy are the antagonists. Escalation is textural—density of hush, parapet thrumming louder—culminating in the final cadence shift. No visible personal cost (fatigue, wound, social risk) blunts the high-band entry; the price is purely existential, which fits the lens yet keeps score sub-8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory’s fragility and the duty to anchor wisdom—emerges from ritual action, not statement. Final image reweights the opening “whisperfield calm” into a charged stillness that “carried a new timbre,” a conceptual repricing earned by the rite. No moralizing line intrudes. The half-mask honesty motif threads through but does not flip meaning; hence short of 8.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly aligned to Elar’s proprioceptive bias—peripheral vision, footfall, sand’s give. Syntax stretches into incantatory loops (“conjured clearings… pockets of stillness”) that teach the ritual pattern early and pay off in the final hush. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is absent, appropriate to solitary rite. Distinctive cadence risks monotony but modulates with parapet crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High figurative density nearly every sentence, yet vehicles stay coherent (sand/curtain, root/aquifer) and serve the Accumulative lens. One paraphrase loop—“whispered… murmurs… whisperfield”—is thematic motif, hence tolerated. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding. Strong propulsion through front-loaded verbs. Final beat free of purple overload. Hairline slip: “kinetic parapet stirred—an ancient object, a living wall” is appositive overkill mid-ritual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fuses mystic dunes, energy-architecture, and archive-monk vocation into a fresh composite; the “kinetic parapet” as buried storm-battery is genuinely novel. Ritual preservation of intangible echo avoids save-the-world stakes yet feels non-generic. Risk is moderate—lyric ritual rather than plot twist—but coherence rewards the gamble. Could swap prophet for any seer without structural change, capping score short of 8.5.</comment>
