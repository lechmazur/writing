<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her levitation feels like a lived power, not a label—but her “labyrinth of self” stays abstract; no concrete contradiction is dramatized inside the maze, so the final fusion feels foregone rather than wrested. The tablet is handled, yet its runes never resist or surprise her; she never misreads, drops, or doubts it, so the object reveals nothing new about her. Motivation is declared early and reiterated, but no micro-choice inside the labyrinth is sharpened by a visible cost; the shadow-self is dispatched in one line with no lasting sting. Earned stasis is asserted (“self whole at last”) yet the price paid remains invisible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—viaduct glow undimmed, time poised—so the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the image does reconfigure meaning; however, the cost is only asserted (“timelines fusing”) rather than dramatized through a forfeiture we can feel. Causality inside the labyrinth is weak: the tablet illuminates a path, but every corridor is a summarised memory; no single wrong turn or re-readable rune narrows her options. The final surge conquers the maze because the text declares the maze was self-imposed, not because an irreversible choice forecloses a live alternative. Thus the resonance is atmospheric, not consequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct, slick stones, and ozone after-rain are tactile, selective, and filter through Elara’s gravity-sharpened senses; the setting actively guides her lift-off. Spatial choreography is clean—she rises, the archway materialises, the threshold folds—no floating rooms. The tablet’s clay texture and shifting runes serve as micro-setting that she grips under pressure. Environment never constrains a tactical choice (no wind shear, no height limit breached), so it enriches atmosphere more than agency, capping the score just below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merge splintered timelines or be lost—is declared early and restated often, but inside the labyrinth the pressure is illustrative: each corridor shows a what-if, yet none threatens to overwrite her present or force a trade-off. The single tightening—shattering the shadow-self—occurs off-stage in one clause; no ability is lost, no new restriction spawned. Because escalation is imagistic rather than causal, the stake’s cost remains conceptual; the lens is Accumulative, but the density intensifies only descriptively, not tactically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the fear that every choice spawns an unlived life is rendered in fractal corridors rather than thesis. The final image of the suspended drop/ripple re-weights the opening motif, offering quiet resonance without moralising. Yet because the labyrinth is revealed as self-imposed and painlessly dissolved, the story edges toward self-help closure—“now I am whole”—blunting moral complexity. Ambiguity lingers in the “periodically eternal” cycle, but Elara’s internal contradiction is never left unresolved on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person lyric voice stays close to Elara’s sensorium—gravity as “whispered secrets,” runes that “seemed to shift”—creating a distinct rhythmic pulse. Syntax stretches and compresses with her levitations, no head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“darkening brightness,” “periodically eternal”) is purposeful, taught early, and echoed at closure. Voice modulation under stress is present; the prose never breaks pattern or drifts into boilerplate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid; sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts are purposeful. Figurative language is dense but patterned—light/drop/ripple—so it reads as deliberate texture, not purple. No mixed metaphors or synonym loops; however, a few near-adjacent abstractions (“twisting maze within her mind where doubts and alternate lives coiled like serpents”) slow propulsion. The closing beat is clean, uncluttered, and lands with crystallised brevity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity-defying protagonist + procedurally generated memory-labyrinth feels fresh; the tablet-as-map device is familiar, but its runic code compiling a path from subconscious data offers a sharp inflection. Risk is taken with a non-antagonist, purely interior maze, yet coherence is maintained. The piece avoids stock dream-quest tropes by keeping the viaduct anchor and after-rain ozone as grounding sensory threads. Transformation test:names could not be swapped without erasing the luminous viaduct image, proving specificity.</comment>
