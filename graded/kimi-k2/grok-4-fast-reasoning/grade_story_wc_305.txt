<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s caretaker identity is embodied through tactile ritual (scalloping) and the final interior turn—accepting cyclical rebirth in lieu of static “contentment”—is earned. However, her brother’s betrayal is only summarised, so forgiveness cost is asserted, not dramatised; that weakens the emotional price anchoring her shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise under an Accumulative lens: the hairpin’s reprise crystallises her re-weighted stance; the “scalloped” vine beat shows visible cost. Orientation is clear by line 10; one clean shard, no teleporting props, pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto is filtered through caretaker priorities—vine wound, pool rim, bark runes—so every detail constrains action. The hairpin as micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; no spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find contentment—tightens once the hairpin re-visions past cycles; scalloping the fresh vine dramatises visible cost, foreclosing the search. Pressure is coherent but single-beat; no second twist or resource lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance-through-cycles emerges from the hairpin’s return and the scallop action; no closing moral stated. Resists binaries yet stays legible, though “vineyard hush” leans toward atmospheric branding rather than shifting meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s senses; vineyard/umbral diction stays consistent, cadence breathes with ascent. No head-hopping, no POV leakage; perceptual signature is strong enough to justify elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty; some lush clusters (“vineyard hush of ripened secrets”) ride the edge of purple but pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, no mixed metaphors, pronouns clean; minor scaffold in “scalloping the edges of those pools had been her ritual” could compress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Forgiveness-as-rebirth through caretaking is fresh; antique hairpin as cyclical talisman repurposes familiar trope. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but specificity of scalloping action and cloud-top grotto keeps it memorable.</comment>
