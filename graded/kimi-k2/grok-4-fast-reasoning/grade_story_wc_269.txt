<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-borne solitude is vivid in the coral-memory beats, but her present-tense desire (“to discover why some paths disappear”) is declared, not dramatized until the overlay scene; the final smile feels prepaid by abstract determination more than by a prior micro-choice that visibly costs her. Interiority leans on stock phrases—“haunted her dreams,” “motivation burned quietly”—without embodied contradiction in the moment of discovery. The tapping ritual is specific and inherited, yet its emotional function plateaus; it steadies rather than complicates her stance, so the Earned Stasis carries only faint cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the atlas overlay re-weights “vanished” into “shifted,” forcing Elara to re-see the ocean’s memory. Causality is intact but thin: the critical insight is triggered by her methodical layering, not by an external complication that narrows options mid-scene. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent; the single shard holds. Accumulation lens dominates—pattern of red ink, tap cadence, salt wind—culminating in a cadence shift rather than a because/therefore turn, satisfying the short-form RR requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station’s sway, salt-stung metal, and the atlas tear’s frayed edge anchor every beat; the notebook’s physical state (yellowed, smuggled) constrains Elara’s tactile ritual and returns in the final overlay. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—engineer’s eye for gauge ticks, diver’s ear for vanished sea songs. Micro-setting triumphs: the desk surface doubles as code surface, merging tool and environment. No object is museum-catalogued; each is handled or weathered on the page, charging the CR image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—has the ocean erased its own memory?—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation rather than reversals. The single deepening (paths rerouted, not erased) is legible and irreversible, but the price paid is purely cognitive; no live option is foreclosed for Elara, only her interpretive frame shifts. Agency is observational, not tactical, limiting escalation bandwidth. Still, the accumulative pressure of rising ink lines against fading atlas edges delivers a felt reconfiguration under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recursion: bleaching as both death and map-blankness, migration as both loss and hidden reroute—without any character naming the metaphor. The atlas page’s migration from relic to lens quietly reweights grief into provisional stewardship; the reader finishes re-thinking “extinction” as spatial amendment rather than terminal erasure. No moralizing coda intrudes; the final tap drift lets the ocean answer. The concept stays particular to Elara’s witnessing vocation, resisting grand-standing eco-allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited remains latched to Elara’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent—measured, salt-corroded, numerate—and syntactic rhythm mimics the station’s sway: long marine clauses, shorter taps. Diction edges toward the poetic but stays within a field-scientist’s lexicon. No dialogue appears; interior monologue avoids filter-stack, though occasional adjectival slightness (“quietly,” “faintly”) softens peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo—lofted clauses under daylight, staccato taps at nightfall. Figurative layer is restrained; mixed-metaphor risk appears once (“orange veins across the water”) but does not tangle causality. Scaffolding is minimal—no paraphrase loops, only purposeful reiteration of “moored” and “periodic” to teach pattern. Information density stays high: each overlay action also tags emotional charge. A lone typo-risk comma splice after “recalibrating narrative” is tolerable at this band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The climate-grief arena is crowded, yet the atlas-as-palimpsest and Morse-tapping diver yields a fresh instrumentation angle. Rerouting—not revival—as revelation sidesteps eco-redemption cliché. Specificity of the 2042 bleaching dive and post-ban thermal plateau roots the premise in lived record rather than abstract futureshock. Risk is moderate: accumulative lyric structure rather than twist, but coherence remains intact. Could edge higher with a sharper proprietary detail that only this narrator could know.</comment>
