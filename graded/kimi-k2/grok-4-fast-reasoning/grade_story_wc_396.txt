<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—pacemaker duty vs. personal pull to the shard—shows in micro-choice (mirrors before orchard). Embodied grief in the shard-warming beat gives cost, but men’s pain is mirrored, not crucible-tested; she never risks status or safety, so the “anomaly” stays asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: shard → mirror visions → orchard intervention → mended peace, each beat narrowing tactics. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she forecloses violence with a joint vigil, cost visible in the shard’s retained fracture. One shard, one scene; orientation crystal by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frost-laden apple trees, tilting mirrors, groaning floes—details filter through Elara’s bias toward balance and hidden fissures. Orchard precipice constrains her approach angle; shard-as-micro-setting charges the final compromise. No clutter; every sensory note either foreshadows fracture or mirrors grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“feud erupts unless empathy intervenes”—tightens when visions force her to speak; the split catch becomes the test. No external reversals, but internal escalation: shard warms, options shrink to speak now or blood follows. Price paid: she shoulders the emotional labor and keeps the shard’s fracture, foreclosing neutrality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme of empathy-as-fragile-repair emerges from shard-to-vigil arc, never sermonized. Final image of “mended peace” beside retained fracture reweights earlier frost-cracks without moral spoon-feeding. Subtext in mirror-glimpses keeps sentimentality at bay; could climb higher if men’s future losses stayed implied rather than narrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s calm-angled perception; syntax lengthens in reflection, shortens in orchard gusts. Diction (“shadow-laced,” “frost-kissed”) feels native to her quiet veil persona. No head-hop; psychic distance cleanly zooms from shelf-dust to men’s pupils.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm rises with wind-gust fragments, ebbs during mirror stillness; no template cadence. Dense double-duty lines (“shard…shattered perhaps by the same tempests”) pack history without scaffolding. Only micro-loop: “their words sharp as cracking ice” echoes prior floe-groan, but the echo is purposeful, not churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard above drifting ice floes feels fresh; crystal empathy-tech merges seer-trope with social glue rather than prophecy. Risk lies in quiet refusal to escalate to violence, yet closure stays legible. Could edge 8.5 if shard fracture had later physical consequence (cuts palm, stains apples) to pay risk in flesh.</comment>
