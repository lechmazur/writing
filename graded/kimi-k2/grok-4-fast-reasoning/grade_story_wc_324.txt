<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s vocation (“contact tracer for hearts”) is vivid and stakes her motivation at once, yet the interior contradiction promised never surfaces; she never hesitates, misreads a pulse, or pays a visible price for her curiosity. The final “assurance” to Mira carries no bodily cost or moment of dread, so the arc is flat. The profession is memorable, but the character feels like a flawless conduit for plot rather than a pressured person.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the atrium is saved, the dead’s voices remain audible, and Mira’s redevelopment is forestalled—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost to Mira and heritage. Causality holds: each beat (aid → locket → recognition of descendant) follows because/therefore logic. The lens is Causal and intact; only the late arrival of Mira on-page keeps the final choice from feeling fully set-up, shaving the top band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Twilight mist, cracked skylight, and the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting constrain every movement; the “reeling hush” is atmospheric glue, not backdrop. The locket and photograph act as portable setting-extensions that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Elara kneels, opens the compartment, tracks pulses—so the environment literally steers discovery. One of the rare pieces where weather and decay participate in the stakes rather than decorate them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserve fragile post-mortem voices—faces one meaningful tightening when Elara links Eliza’s pulse to Mira’s demolition plan. Agency is present: Elara acts, confronts, and forecloses the redevelopment path. Yet the cost is borne off-page by Mira, not Elara; the tracer herself loses nothing tactile in the beat, keeping the pressure instructive rather than visceral. Sufficient for the word count, but not gut-punching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as public health, caretaking extended past death. The locket’s inscription and the saved atrium reweight “voices that endure” without sermon. Subtext stays in gesture—Elara’s fingers brushing the aid, Mira’s silhouetted blueprints—never articulated as thesis. Only the final spoken assurance veers toward explicit, muting the resonance a notch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds steady; perception is filtered through Elara’s tuned ear and fingertip pulses, yielding a sensory signature. Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic mist—”a reeling hush that pressed against her skin like damp velvet”—yet tightens when pulses spike. No dialogue, so voice carries entirely through rhythmic description without monotony. Achieves stylistic distinction without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense: one sentence slips three senses plus plot gear (“cool metal of her tools”) without clog. Metaphors stay coherent (whispers→shadows→pulse) and avoid mixed vehicles. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks; each paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. The single hedge preventing 9+ is occasional double adjective padding (“bruised purples and grays”) that could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” grafts epidemiology onto hauntology—fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. The hearing-aid-as-stethoscope for the afterlife is specific, low-tech, and irreplaceable; remove it and the story collapses. Emotional truth overrides gimmick: caregiver lineage versus redevelopment is a believable tension, not a puzzle box. Risky concept executed with disciplined follow-through.</comment>
