<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism is asserted but never tested in scene; she pivots from doubt to resolve without a visible micro-choice that costs her anything. "Ghostly resolve" is declared, not dramatized. Interiority leans on lyrical labels ("tragically radiant," "luminous sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction. The archiving beat shows agency, yet the emotional stakes remain abstract because her own quarantined memories are summarized, not enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent shell and brightening garden reconfigure meaning with legible cost—she forfeits the voices she has housed. Accumulative lens holds: each archived memory adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The causal chain is thin—no beat shows her risking absorption or rejecting an alternative—but the pattern of intensifying echo suffices under Accumulative rules.</comment>

<comment>Garden, shell, and twilight light constrain action: moss cushions her knees, dew scents the air, the fading star sets a soft countdown. Selective sensory detail (dew-kissed petals, cooling breeze) filters through Elara's wary attention. Spatial ground holds as she kneels, rises, walks away. The shell acts as micro-setting that physically channels the resonance; its iridescent veins mirror the garden's velvet hues, charging the final image when she buries it among the roots.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn isolation into independence—signals early and tightens through each archived memory; the garden's growing luminescence externalizes the rising cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when her own quarantined past begins to resonate, narrowing options: continue and risk self-dissolution, or stop and remain alone. No visible price is dramatized on her body or psyche, so the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral, capping the band just below excellence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the iterative act of archiving: isolation alchemized into self-containment without external validation. The shell's emptied silence and dawn-bright garden reweight the opening motif of quarantined voices, offering a non-literal answer—solidarity through solitary transformation. No moral is stated; the image carries the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: independence may itself be a quarantine, but the text does not force the reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara's perceptual filter: "velvet garden," "forgotten veils," "quarantined memories" all reflect her haunted precision. Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath-control during resonance beats, mirroring the tuning process. No head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated diction ("alchemize," "conceptual repricing") feels consistent with her cerebral stance rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet information-dense; most sentences perform double duty (atmosphere + causality). Figurative layering risks purple in clusters ("velvet garden," "forgotten veils," "tragically radiant") but the pattern is taught early and paid off at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor scaffold: "quarantined memories" is repeated four times in close proximity; tightening one instance would sharpen momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The conceit of "archiving quarantined memories via resonance structures" freshens the familiar trope of haunted objects. Crystalline lattice analogy borrows from materials science yet stays intuitive. Specificity of the half-shell—iridescent veins, porous curve—grounds the concept. Risk is moderate: lyric accumulative structure rather than plot twist, but it coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
