<comment>Elowen’s interiority is vivid—her “driftingly alert” stance and embodied reaction to the ghost’s pulse show contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to merge ghost with mural is earned by her established vocation of voicing the overlooked, and the cost (loss of solitude, irreversible fusion) is felt. No stock phrasing or diagnostic self-talk. Minor slip: “seldom-heard” is asserted more than dramatized until late.</comment>

<comment>Single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each graffito stroke layers density until the ghost’s release reconfigures the courtyard’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as the luminous wisp hovers “gratefully,” reweighting the space and Elowen’s purpose. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. No causal leaps; every beat follows “because/therefore” of artistic encoding.</comment>

<comment>The misty courtyard is no backdrop; its shifting fog literally guides Elowen to the bolt plate and later shapes the ghost’s emergence. Cloud-blossoms supply luminescent pigment, constraining her palette and tactics. Spatial choreography is exact: “vast stone surfaces begging for transformation” anchors the mural site. Weather and altitude affect breath, light, and pigment viscosity—details that charge the final image.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: give voice to the bolted-away dreams. Pressure tightens as thunder nears; each encoded line narrows time and raises stakes of irreversible fusion. The decisive turn—pressing the plate into the mural—forces a trade-off: ghost freed, Elowen forever linked as its conduit. Cost is visible in the “luminous wisp” and her own voice now carrying extra weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of articulating silenced creations. Subtext lives in the ghost’s “silent longings” and Elowen’s reluctant yet compelled response. No moralizing; the final image of hovering light invites multiple readings—liberation or new burden. Motifs of gears and flowers reconfigure from mechanical oppression to organic release without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elowen’s perceptual signature—“subtle shifts in the mist” she alone notices. Syntax mirrors her drifting alertness: long, flowing sentences that compress under pressure (“her fingers tracing the cool metal”). No head-hopping; ghost’s voice is mediated through her interpretation. Distinct diction—“tinkersong wonder,” “luminous cloud-blossoms”—remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; “flickering lines of code that danced like fireflies” is the only simile and it lands. Rhythm accelerates with the storm: longer clauses yield to staccato strokes as she paints. Zero grammar slips, precise punctuation, and strong verbs (“surge,” “merge,” “swell”) keep momentum high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Victorian flower-press + digital ghost + graffiti ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds—storm-time graffiti as code-transmission is non-obvious yet fully realized. No derivative echoes; the “ghost in code” avoids cyber-cliché by anchoring to brass gears and floral motifs. Concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
