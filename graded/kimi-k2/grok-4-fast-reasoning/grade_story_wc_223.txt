<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s survivor guilt and historian motive are embodied in beat-level micro-choices (spelling “release” with her feet, erasing chess pieces). Contradictory impulses—benevolent yet ruthless—surface in the deliberate severing of the “unscripted” pawns, earning the late shift inside the whispering gallery. Interiority stays concrete and character-particular without stock metaphors. Closure choice freezes the kings because pawns are already liberated voids: credible Earned Stasis with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality hinges on Elara’s incantatory walk pattern; each footstep tightens pressure toward the archive’s unbinding. Orientation is anchored by end of first 120 words via dome acoustics’ description. Two-shard arc compresses setup → climax in one seamless motion. Closure (Decisive Change) lands when the spectral cascade rewrote the stakes, cost visible in luminous absence of pawns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Body-as-setting: the marble floor under her soles becomes the text she etches. Filtered through POV, only the acoustics, table, and absent pawns get selective sensory weight, reinforcing powerlessness. Recurring “chessboard stripped bare” constrains every later choice—strategy collapses without the foot-soldiers. Micro-setting charges the final image of luminous absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free the archive’s forgotten gestures) tightens once the binding resists, forcing a price—her own mnemonic labor and legibility of absence. One visible escalation: she appends “sever” to the spell when the flood coils threaten pull. That choice forecloses secret vengeance and aligns with benevolent ruthlessness. No coincidence, pure agency and cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes around how small gestures eclipse grand designs; this is shown, not told, through the vanished pawns and spectral archive. Final image—absent soldiers—reweights power’s illusion without moralizing. Subtext is in the silence of the “forsaken palace.” Some late illumination borders overt—still lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sensory compression matches urgency; “luminous absence” is a charged sensory paradox taught early. Rhythm varied across beats—soft echo → sharp sever. No filter-verb stacks; body-state and acoustics mirror psychic distance shifts. Dialogue is absent, so focus is interior voice coherence and rhythmic pressure under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is tight and textured—no loops, no synonym churn. Figurative density is intentional (luminous absence, ebony and ivory relic) and charges closure. Sentence rhythm accelerates toward the unbinding without muddle. Only minor overwrites: “nomadic penumbra” verges on purple. Information density high; lines do two jobs each.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Freshest synthesis: crisis-actor-turned-true-historian who uses choreographed steps to unbind real history. Pawn-absence as permanent void is a non-obvious visual marker that reconfigures power. Transformation test: swap Elara for a different survivor and the luminous absence collapses. Within-band risk for lyric mode elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
