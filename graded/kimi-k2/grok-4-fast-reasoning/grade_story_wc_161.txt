<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—his ritual of mapping dust motes to steady memory loss is specific and charged. The shift from forged histories to authentic song-sharing with Mira is earned through visible micro-choices and cost. Secondary pressure from Mira is minimal but sufficient to tilt trust. The final renunciation of reinvention carries felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the meteorite under the skylight reweights the entire attic from site of erasure to site of renewal. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each paper trail and dust-mote map accrues until the joint message to the world redefines the space. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic’s mildew, cracked skylight, and pigeon crates constrain every move; the meteorite chip becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—dust motes bloom then wither in exact rhythm with memory. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects track. Weather is absent but not missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trust in the world’s reliability—tightens when the first pigeon returns intact, then deepens through shared song with Mira. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and situational. One credible loss: the abandonment of forged histories. Cost is visible in the relinquished safety of lies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of authentic renewal versus self-erasure emerges from the meteorite’s alien permanence against paper ephemera. Subtext operates in the silence between Elias and Mira as songs replace forgeries. Final image of the chip under swirling motes offers a non-literal answer: permanence can coexist with fragile trust. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded—syntax mirrors Elias’s obsessive mapping and hesitant thaw. No dialogue until Mira arrives, and her lines carry distinct, ink-stained idiom. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance tightens at moments of risk. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, memory, and motion. Metaphors (motes as memory particles, meteorite as talisman) are precise and never mixed. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—wounded veteran, attic redemption—are transformed through the dust-mote cartography and Martian fragment. The synthesis of cosmic relic with folk song feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
