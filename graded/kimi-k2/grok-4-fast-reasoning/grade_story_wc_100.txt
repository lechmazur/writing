<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s exhausted undertaker is vivid through aching bones, salt-memory interiority, and the micro-choice to slice his palm on lens-glass; stubborn trait drives every beat. The interior contradiction—craving stillness yet unable to ignore the shard’s cry—stays embodied, not label-speak. Final renunciation of personal rest to anchor others costs him bodily presence in impossible space; cost is legible. Voice remains singular, no status dynamics needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: package → lens → blood → impossible space → re-forging → souls shelved. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses his own escape from the library, price paid in lingering bifurcation ache. Orientation anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “chased stillness” repeated three times early could tighten, but beat remains clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent stacks, barnacle-spined tomes, and paradoxical alcoves are filtered through Elias’s bone-deep fatigue; every sensory pick mirrors his craving for hush. The re-formed lens on its pedestal literally illuminates the final stillness—setting charges the image. Spatial track clean: body half-in/half-out of folded aisle is never lost. No exposition dump; world rules taught by action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“give rest a permanent address”—faces immediate test when lens fractures broadcast fresh distress. Tightening occurs when palm-blood mending demands he occupy the impossible space, foreclosing retreat; cost is the lingering split he accepts. Causal lens: each because/therefore linkage narrows options until the library becomes the last coffin. Pressure coherent, no coincidence resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of custodial duty versus self-annihilation emerges through glass-repair gesture, not statement. Final image of lens-beacon for the already-rested reweights earlier “stillness” from personal desire to public service—Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing line; irony that undertaker buries himself in the archive lingers. Subtext in salt-smell regret and faulty-beacon dreams sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is maritime-gothic, salted and exhausted: “skeletal fingers,” “wax that smelled of salt and regret.” Rhythm swells and ebbs with scene pressure; clauses lengthen during impossible-space stretch, then collapse into hush. No dialogue, hence no contamination. Free-indirect diction stays within Elias’s lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences carry dual cargo: “luminous wisps…like moths to a eternal flame” advances both image and souls’ trajectory. No loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors; “eternal flame” article slip is lone typo. Density peaks during lens-mending without purple overload. Paragraph cuts purposeful; each block advances position or stakes. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors tidal inhale/exhale.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Undertaker in sunken Atlantis library reframing lighthouse lens into soul-shelf feels novel yet inevitable. Specificity—barnacle tomes, geometry-breaking alcoves—prevents trope theft. Risk of “impossible space” portal pays off by forcing bodily cost. Transformation test fails if Elias swapped out; lens, library, and stubbornness are inseparable.</comment>
