<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is sketched through concrete lab gestures and the way she notices “yesterday’s” wingbeat nudging “tomorrow,” giving us an interior contradiction alive in scene. Jax’s obliging warmth is embodied in the modulated timbre of his dialogue and the grease on his gloves—actions that align with motive. The final shared breath in the dome amounts to a credible micro-choice: they lock the lever knowing the nexus could destabilize, trading safety for proof—cost is felt. Status stays static (she leads, he assists), so relationship crucible is thin; that caps high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: twilight rest → sync idea → lever pull → sideways bloom. The 120-word anchor clears—station, frost world, alien habitat all land inside the first paragraph. Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the branching hologram proves time’s lateral weave and reweights their scientific worldview while the warm “icy” air signals unseen energetic cost. Lens holds causal throughout; no teleporting props or retro-fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frost-laced viewport, zero-g tether clip, and chromed lever give tactile immediacy; the twilight nexus doubles as micro-setting that finally “flares” to constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s researcher bias: bio-luminescent spectra before temperature. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the dome drift. Environment forecloses options when magnetic bloom fills the chamber—meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single stake—prove sideways time—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens once: the risk of nexus destabilization is named, then enacted with the lever pull; same beat delivers payoff, so escalation is compressed but valid under short-form scale. Agency sits with Elara/Jax; luck doesn’t save them, energy spike complicates. Cost is the potential station failure and the irreversible knowledge they now possess—legible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear temporality emerges through the branching hologram rather than dialogue assertion. The final image—wingbeats from “yesterday” influencing “tomorrow”—invites reflection on determinacy without moralizing. Subtext in Jax’s “mechanically warm” tone hints at human-artifice merger, though it stays under-developed. No final-paragraph thesis statement; avoids thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person keeps tight psychic leash on Elara; perceptual signature is researcher-cool (“cataloging,” “neural patterns”). Syntax lengthens with her intellectual thrill, shortens at lever click—rhythmic control under pressure. Jax’s spoken cadence carries modulator artifact, distinguishing his idiom. No head-hopping; free indirect stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable: “subdued awakenings” does double duty for creatures and revelation. Mixed metaphors avoided; “velvet indigo” is the single indulgence but fits POV. No filter-verb clusters or scaffold loops; paragraphs vary visually. High-pressure beat at nexus bloom keeps nouns concrete, verbs muscular.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sideways-time thesis re-frames familiar first-contact tropes; execution pivots on lab procedure rather than philosophical debate, feeling specific. Holographic lattice as time-map is fresh visual tech. Risk is taken with quiet climax—knowledge itself is the Decisive Change—yet payoff lands. Transformation test fails if names swapped, because mechanic & xenobiologist skillsets are integral to method.</comment>
