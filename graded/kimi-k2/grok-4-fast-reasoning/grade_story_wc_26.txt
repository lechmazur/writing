<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile grip on the river stone, the ache of “luminous regret”—but the final choice to stabilize the shadow feels slightly under-motivated; we see the cost (tears) more than the internal contradiction that forces her hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: decades-old footage → shadow drawn → metamorphosis → stabilized bloom. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where hope’s silhouette is etched at visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The blooming library is sensuously anchored—crystal domes, cloud-pages, rarefied air—and the river stone’s weight literally tethers Elara’s choices, constraining her final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened once via the footage comparison; the shadow’s metamorphosis narrows options to stabilize or lose hope forever. Cost is felt in Elara’s glowing tears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the footage contrast: shared dreams commodify hope until it fractures. The final stabilized bloom offers a non-literal, bittersweet answer—hope preserved yet altered—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature: “softly deliberate grace,” “sharp-eyed dusk noticer.” Syntax mirrors her measured attention; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; metaphors (“clouds billowed like pages”) are precise and never muddle causality. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure; zero loops or filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The dream-sharing premise is familiar, but the aerial library and footage-based hope-archiving offer a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final charged image of the stabilized shadow-bloom.</comment>
