<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s yearning is stated repeatedly but never tested by an opposing want; the gear and hum nudge him forward, yet every beat is acquiescence, not choice. Interiority drifts into lyrical tags—“buzzing with fragments of insight”—rather than embodied contradiction. The final “wild frontier” opens because the forest gifts it, not because Elias risks anything or forfeits an alternative. No cost is legible on the page, so the arc feels observed, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure reaches a Charged Poise: the clearing synapse of mind and machine is visually legible, but the cost is purely declarative (“had guided him home”). Translocation sequences are mosaic shards, yet transitions are cued only by “that night / one afternoon,” teaching no pattern until late. Causality is accumulative—each wind-listen adds texture rather than narrowing options—so the lens holds, but the final reweighting is thinner than the lyrical buildup promises.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest is evoked with sensory economy: “oiled leaves,” “birch blades slicing air,” metallic sap scent. Environment doubles as psyche-map, so micro-setting (the binary-barked oak, steel-root cavern) constrains translocation paths and charges the final glade image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across dream-leaps; no anchor drift. One of the few categories where the conceit fully pays off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stake—“rediscover the wild frontier”—is declared early but never sharpened into a concrete forfeiture or deadline. Pressure escalates only texturally: the hum grows louder, the gear warms, but no choice forecloses an alternative. Translocation presents mild disorientation, never danger or trade-off. Without a visible price or narrowing option, escalation feels decorative rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed cognition emerges through imagistic refrain rather than thesis, satisfying the “no moral” rule. The gear-neuron metaphor carries consistent conceptual weight, reprised at the end. Yet the absence of sacrificed alternative keeps the repricing mild; the insight feels affirmative, not costly. Ambiguity is present but not charged—reader reweights less than character does.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-limited sustains a stray-philosopher idiom: “tangled map of forgotten ideas,” “hydraulic grace.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with the hum’s cadence, keeping prose as character. No dialogue to distort register. Occasional elevated diction (“improbable miracles,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward authorial, but the lyrical frame absorbs it. Distinct perceptual signature holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong noun-verb pairs and selective metaphor keep density high; only rare loop (“whispers that carried truths,” “whispering elms”) repeats sensory root. Hydraulic/organic hybrids stay coherent. One mixed moment—“thoughts cascading like waterfalls over pistons”—compresses two vehicles but doesn’t stall climax. Otherwise clean, rhythmic, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentient mechanical rainforest is familiar milieu, but the wind-as-cartography method feels fresh and specific to this POV. Gear-as-neuron links world rule to psychic arc without exposition dump. Risk is moderate: dream-jumps could have broken causality, yet pattern stays legible. Could swap names and still function, so not fully singular, but the synesthetic map device lifts it above stock.</comment>
