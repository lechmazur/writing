<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, hollow reflection, and deliberate severing of memory-threads embody a man split between despair and the need to remake himself. The contradiction between wanting to paint souls and fearing the darkness he must enter is dramatized in every micro-choice. The final renunciation of past failures carries a felt cost: the ache remains luminescent, not erased. Only a slight drift toward abstract self-diagnosis (“necessary darkness”) keeps this from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: accident → lost muse → flight to lighthouse → discovery of tarot box → untangling as ritual redesign. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mandala of cards and newly bound cord crystallize a before/after in Elias’s stance toward his art. Cost is legible in the lingering ache and the deliberate binding of the cord—an Earned Stasis that forecloses easy redemption. Minor orientation drift in the first 120 words (who/where slightly late) nudges it under 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is no postcard: salt-crusted windows, dust-veiled table, groaning stairs, and rising tide press inward as physical correlatives of claustrophobia. The tarot box’s warped cards and knotted threads become micro-setting that literally constrains Elias’s choices—he must untangle or suffocate. Sensory selection narrows to moon-slivers, damp paper, and the phosphorescent ache, all filtered through an artist’s eye. Only a touch of static “lighthouse” shorthand keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—can Elias salvage his ability to paint souls?—is signaled early and tightened by each knot he loosens. The decisive deepening occurs when he realizes the threads are his own memories; each severance narrows future options and exacts an emotional toll. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the storm outside merely intensifies pressure. The cost is visible in the final image: a bound cord that replaces the broken box, sealing both loss and possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of untangling: fragmentation is not a flaw to fix but material to re-weave. The tarot’s fractured imagery and the lighthouse’s fractured light mirror Elias’s psyche without overt statement. The final image—a mandala of cards and a newly bound cord—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: art born from necessary darkness. A hairline risk of thematic echo in “luminescent ache” keeps it just shy of 9.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—salt taste, tremor of hands, selective attention to color and texture. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during panic, mirroring his spiral. No head-hopping; even the phantom footsteps remain external. A single moment of elevated diction (“jagged pieces of reality”) slightly jars but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “salt-crusted windows let in slivers of moonlight” does triple sensory work. Rhythm modulates from languid to staccato as pressure rises. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no mixed metaphors. One near-cliché (“hollowed by regret”) is forgiven for its precise placement in a cracked mirror.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lighthouse, tarot, and portrait artist feels inevitable yet fresh—each element transforms the others. Risk is taken in the quiet, ritualistic climax rather than a dramatic rescue, and it pays off. No close echoes of famous lighthouse or artist stories; the mandala of cards as closure is specific to this voice. A fractional deduction for the familiar “storm outside” intensifier.</comment>
