<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wanderer’s erased-identity flaw fuels every eavesdropping micro-choice; the accumulating self-portrait through stolen stories is embodied, not labeled. There is no interior contradiction shown in-scene, only a steady accretion, so the arc feels observational rather than crucible-forged. Still, the final “nameless existence that filtered the labyrinth’s chaos into something whole” is earned by the prior layering beats and carries a visible cost: perpetual displacement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the second paragraph and held to the Charged Poise closure atop the container. Each shard adds density rather than causal linkage; the final image crystallizes the collected histories into a coherent, solitary identity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 120 words. Closure carries conceptual cost—the wanderer’s life is now defined by fragments not their own—but the price is more inferred than viscerally felt, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Port container maze is vivid, tactile, and filtered through the POV’s ghost-seeing bias; tide-driven layout constrains movement and dictates when eavesdropping can occur. The peeling poison label acts as micro-setting that returns to charge the ending. Selective sensory detail (diesel brine, barnacle-crusted secrets) mirrors internal erosion without slipping into catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent across climbs, crouches, and perches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the texture of erased lives—escalates as each tide cycle exposes new stories and narrows the wanderer’s options to keep listening rather than act. Pressure grows accumulative: every fragment layered tightens the wanderer’s identification with the forgotten dead. No causal reversal, but a meaningful deepening at the final weave. Cost is conceptual (perpetual outsiderhood) rather than tangible, visible but not viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of disposable histories: memory is not linear narrative but jagged, salt-crusted layers that resist administrative erasure. Subtext resides in the act of listening itself—colonizing others’ grief to fabricate a self. Final image reweights earlier fragments without moralizing. The refusal to claim a name becomes an earned, ambiguous stance rather than a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person keeps intimate psychic distance; perceptual signature—“filters reality differently,” “ghosts of erased histories”—remains consistent and rhythmically controlled. Compressed, lyrical syntax matches the tidal cadence; no head-hopping. Dockworker dialogue is coarse, goal-driven, distinct from narrator’s imagistic register. No filter-verb stacks; elisions are pattern-taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and opening, propelling the accumulative design; only two adjacent paraphrase loops (“layered…layers”) appear, minor. Figurative language is dense but cohesive, never muddled; metaphors stay maritime and metallurgical. No scaffolding or synonym churn in peak beats. Clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise flips the zombie trope into bureaucratic ghosting; the port-container labyrinth as memory-archive feels fresh. Risk-taking in the accumulative mosaic pays off in the final weave. Specific sensory detail (mislabeled poison bottle, dissolving photographs) grounds novelty. Could edge higher if one layer had reversed the wanderer’s tactics instead of only deepening mood.</comment>
