<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (to mend Elias vs. accept exile) act simultaneously in scene. The micro-choice to cut her finger and guide the ink is specific and stakes-raising. Flaw: Elias’s ghost speaks in slightly therapeutic cadence (“Your anxiety rises”), a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the defragmentation completes, Elias stabilizes, and Elara’s heartbeat steadies—felt cost is the blood she spills and the irreversible exile the act confirms. Causal chain (ink → scanner → Elias) is tight and legible under a Causal lens. No orientation debt; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal observatory, lantern light on frost, and porcelain shard all constrain choices—she can’t leave, must use what’s at hand. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“iridescent walls caught the faint glow”). Shard-as-tool meets the 9+ gate by charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim meaning from bureaucratic death—tightens when the ink ritual becomes the only path to restore Elias. One decisive intensification: the scanner’s whir reweights options, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the blood and the irrevocable exile it ratifies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of harvesting wisdom from failure emerges through concrete action (ink patterns = corrupted data reassembled) without direct statement. Final image—steady heartbeat, radio hum—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: life persists by integrating fracture. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is Elara’s scientific-archivist bias (“digital ledgers,” “defragment”). Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during the cut, longer cadence as Elias clarifies. Elias’s diction edges toward therapeutic, a minor voice leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“spilled ink bloomed…whispers from the void”). Metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates during the ritual, then exhales into the final steady count. No overwriting in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—death-certificate exile meets ghost-defrag via ink sigils—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test: swap shard for stylus or Elias for AI and the emotional arc collapses. Specificity of “opal observatory under eternal snow” anchors the concept.</comment>
