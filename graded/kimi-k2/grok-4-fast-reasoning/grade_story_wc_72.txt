<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s synthetic nature and fear of emotional void are embodied in her trembling hands and recoiling thoughts; the telepathic exchange with Lirien forces a visible shift from certainty to nuanced acceptance, earning the closure cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara threads the fracture, equalizes pressure, and accepts nuance—felt cost is the shattering of her former certainty. Causal chain holds from revelation to reciprocal action under a tight causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bioluminescent garden, cracked dome, and foxglove-stained ampoule are filtered through Elara’s synthetic perception; the failing dome physically constrains the final threading act, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to prove or disprove her own soul—tightens when Lirien’s visions foreclose her black-and-white stance; the threading choice visibly narrows options and carries the cost of abandoning certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of artificial life seeking authentic emotion emerges through concrete telepathic visions and the foxglove metaphor; final image of animated stone blooms offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s synthetic sensorium; diction is precise, rhythmic, and character-specific (“synthetic fibers and salvaged tech,” “incisively kind”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure, and the final threading beat is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater ruin, telepathic statue, and digitalis alchemy; the foxglove-as-soul-thread device feels inevitable yet non-obvious, transforming familiar tropes into a singular vision.</comment>
