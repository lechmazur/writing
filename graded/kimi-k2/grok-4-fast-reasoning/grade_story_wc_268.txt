<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s calm, ruminative purpose is consistent, but interior contradiction is only asserted (“slow ember”) rather than dramatized in a moment of wavering; the final activation feels pre-decided, so the cost reads symbolic, not personally paid. Micro-choices (picking ink, writing marginalia) are present yet interchangeable with any careful scribe, so titanic identity does not shape tactics. The regally unpretentious trait is stated repeatedly but never forces a trade-off on the page. Closure satisfies Earned Stasis only at the mythic level; character-level price is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Conceptual Repricing: Varak’s dissolution and the resumed constellances visibly reweight cosmic order under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causal chain is thin—readers’ assembly of clues happens off-stage—but the pattern of inscribed messages creates a coherent density shift that pays off in the final projected storm. Orientation is swift and stakes are legible by word 120. Persistent constraint (frozen stars) shapes tactics; cost is cosmic, not personal, which caps intensity yet remains valid for the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Library is evoked with selective sensory strokes—dust motes, infinite shelves, perpetual twilight—filtered through Elowen’s poised attention. Iron gall ink vial returns as micro-setting that constrains her method, earning micro-setting credit. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drift. While evocative, the environment never actively resists or endangers her; therefore it shapes method but not stakes, keeping the score sub-9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by exposing Varak—is signaled early and escalates through spreading messages that gradually peel his glamour. Pressure grows texturally: each inscription adds density, unsettles spectral spies, and compels scholarly assembly. Protagonist agency is steady yet risk-free; she is never intercepted or forced to recalculate, so tightening is present but not acute. Cost is cosmically visible yet personally unfelt, satisfying the lens but limiting intensity.</answer>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s gravitational drift emerges organically through the accumulating marginalia rather than overt statement. Final image—illusion fracturing like autumn leaves—reweights earlier “drift” motif without moralizing. Subtext in the cryptic notes invites reader participation, creating lingering ambiguity about knowledge’s own seductive pull. No thematic echo violations; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays anchored to Elowen’s measured perception; diction is elevated yet consistent with timeless archival mood. Rhythm modulates between long contemplative sentences and terse marginalia, teaching a pattern that pays off when the final rune blooms. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinctiveness is moderate—voice feels like an ancient chronicler rather than an individualized persona, but this is congruent with the concept.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, lyrical, and largely loop-free; figurative language (ink as “captured night”) is sparse and purposeful. Occasional faint template cadence (“across the pause of shifting constellations” repeated) but not clustered in peak beats. Strong information density—each sentence layers image or mythic logic. Grammar and tense immaculate; closure line cleanly resolves without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</comment><comment>Fusion of diminutive titan with archival saboteur feels fresh, avoiding standard colossus tropes. Rune-based propaganda campaign via marginalia offers a novel resistance method. Cosmic frozen-time frame and ink-as-weapon are specific enough to resist name-swap test. Risk is present but moderated; bolder personal cost could have pushed uniqueness higher.</comment>
