<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-rooted need to “name the hue” of apology is steady and embodied; the compass-lace test forces a visible micro-choice. His interior contradiction—pride vs. regret—shows in the remembered harsh critique and the salt-water ritual, so change is motivated. The pine-sprig graft into the lace makes the cost tactile, fulfilling the Earned Stasis. Still, the apprentice remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is second-hand, capping the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cerulean stain on the lace crystallizes his apology and forecloses further drifting. Causal chain—compass → lace → salt-dawn reveal—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens, each beat adding density until the color blooms. The final image carries conceptual cost: he must now teach “with lessons born of loss.” One minor causality gap: why the compass suddenly points homeward is asserted, not sourced, but it does not rupture the reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>The islet’s post-rain rocks, hollow gourd, and driftwood cluster are tactile, stage the salt-water ritual, and track spatially. Weathered stone and diffused mist operate as micro-setting that constrains how he kneels, collects water, and displays lace. The antique lace itself becomes a setting-within-setting whose stitch density must be deciphered, directly shaping tactics. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens when the lace directive demands salt-tears and dawn light, a single deepening that narrows options. Protagonist agency drives every beat: he chooses to read, mix, and stain; the cerulean payoff prices him with public admission. Under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices for escalation; no reversals required. Cost is legible yet modest—one sprig and one whisper—so entry to 8.8+ is blocked.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from the specific color yielded by salt, light, and thread: remorse must be materialized before it can be relinquished. Subtext resides in the ghost-ship compass—an echo of voyages that never return—so the final homeward twist reweights earlier maritime loss. No thesis is stated; the cerulean stain is the non-literal answer. The only drag is the near-literal echo of “cerulean regret” in opening and close, slightly thinning ambiguity.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s slow, horticultural perception; perceptual signature shows in “pruning a miniature pine,” “diffused ink,” and the wry “tears of the sea.” Rhythmic control mirrors bonsai patience—long sentences breathe, then tighten at the color bloom. No head-hopping; diction stays within his cultivated lexicon. One clause drifts toward editorial lyric (“sky bruised with cerulean regret”) but is taught early and paid off, so voice cohesion survives.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no template cadence or synonym loops detected. Figurative layer is dense but patterned—compass pulses, lace whispers, tide breathes—taught by the 25% mark and harvested at closure, so the density penalty is waived. Information often doubles: “severance—when his apprentice…”—efficient. A single mixed metaphor (“anchors…hanging in his chest”) is minor; clarity remains intact. No artifacts touch the final beat, keeping 9+ range open.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The marriage of bonsai discipline to ghost-ship navigation via coded lace feels fresh and specific; the notion that regret must be dyed into fabric to be seen is a non-obvious synthesis. Tropes of maritime ghost relic and mentor grief are transformed through horticultural patience and textile cipher. Risk is taken with lyric density, yet coherence holds. Transformation test fails if names change, because bonsai-lace-compass triad is irreducible, but the core premise is still recognizable; hence, shy of the top band.</comment>
