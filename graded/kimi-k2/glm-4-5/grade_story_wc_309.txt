<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for wonder while fearing inadequacy—drives every beat; the embodied moment of unstrapping the Regulation Pack crystallizes his hierarchy of values and costs him institutional safety. The final shift from “underachieving” to “present” is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone’s luminance reweights the premise, making standardized magic feel hollow. Causal chain holds—archive mention → mist walk → unstrap → keystone bloom—each step narrowing options until the final charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire and garden folly are not backdrop; their geometries and lingering light constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (Regulation Pack as body-tool) functions as setting that limits magic and must be shed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover wonder versus conform—is signaled early and tightened once: unstrapping the Pack forecloses safe return to automated magic. Cost is visible in the spire’s subtle transformation and the weekly gatherings that risk censure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the sacred in the simple is dramatized through Elias’s tactile shedding of constraints, not asserted. Final image of “brilliant dimness” quietly reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s wonder-starved gaze. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure, e.g., “brilliant dimness” as oxymoron that mirrors his paradoxical longing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“brilliant dimness” repeated twice without new charge—keeps it from 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: automation-era mage seeks pre-algorithmic wonder via abandoned mist walking. The inversion of “brilliant dimness” as non-source light feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
