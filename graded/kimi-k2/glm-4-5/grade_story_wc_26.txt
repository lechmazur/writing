<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (tightening fingers on the stone), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final recognition of the lost friend is moving yet feels slightly under-motivated by prior causality, landing more as elegy than earned choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the shadow’s dissolution into moonlight reweights Elara’s mission from cataloguing anomalies to witnessing love’s persistence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly observation thickens pattern until the final image crystallizes cost. One minor drift: the “Great Division” backstory is introduced late without cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The blooming library is evoked with selective sensory detail (petal-soft leaves, crystal dome) that constrains Elara’s movement and frames the shadow’s dance. The river stone functions as micro-setting, warming in her hand to mark the metamorphosis. Spatial choreography is clean; only the library’s operational rules remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the shadow to preserve hope—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow reveals the lost friend, forcing Elara to accept luminous regret as cost. Escalation is one deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for length. Agency is observational, yet the final stance crystallizes with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of love’s persistence beyond death emerges through concrete particulars (shadow’s patient search, stone’s warmth) rather than statement. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the shadow’s “questioning and definitive” gesture carries silent accusation and forgiveness simultaneously.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“breath catch in her throat”). Perceptual signature is sharp-eyed and botanically precise. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; free-indirect texture remains consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous regret”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence layering image and emotion. Minor loop: “shadow unbound” phrase repeats three times without pattern-teaching. Metaphors (origami in reverse) are fresh and coherent. No filter-verb stacks; syntax varies. One typo risk—“shareable” used twice in two sentences near opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—post-revolution dream-sharing library where shadows detach—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of ghostly return and lost love are transformed through botanical-cosmic setting and archival footage device. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final light-merge. No close echoes detected.</comment>
