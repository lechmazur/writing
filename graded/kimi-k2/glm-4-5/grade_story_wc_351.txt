<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Engineer’s obsession and interior desperation register in concrete fixations—micro-adjusting a cracked mirror mid-quake, choosing self-surgery via electrodes—yet the emotional ledger between solo visionary and excavated stranger crowds stays summarized rather than embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands hard: a broken shard reconfigures from limitation to lens, turning abandoned dreams into an archaeological map that reweights both identity and mission with visible conceptual cost while holding to an accumulative-textural drive throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moon-drenched circuitry on canyon rock supplies both glamour and functional pressure—mirror geometry dictates sightlines, silver glare dictates mood—while the fractured reflection that charges the final beat is specific to this moonscape and cannot be ported elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Inward pressure intensifies as each memory layer costs cognitive coherence; stakes shift from technological success to existential survival, one tightening choice at a time, paced under an accumulative lens that forces renunciation rather than victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Resurrecting cast-off dreams reframes nostalgia as archaeology: beauty extracted from abandonment becomes a quiet manifesto against a society discarding hopes; the quaking, near-religious tone marries wonder with dread.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Helix-like spirals in syntax mirror the narrator’s DNA-minded obsession; periscope shards refract metaphor into literal sight lines, creating a tactile lens; voice modulates from clinical precision to tremulous awe without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose alternates lyric cadence and surgical crispness; occasional purple compression (“moonlight painted circuit boards in ethereal blues”) slightly dulls momentum, but diction stays character-specific and error-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Entangled-memory archaeology and a periscope-as-consciousness-portal fuse fresh sci-fi with visceral metaphor; risk feels earned, transformation inevitable in hindsight—yet the speculative premise remains familiar just shy of paradigm shift.</comment>
