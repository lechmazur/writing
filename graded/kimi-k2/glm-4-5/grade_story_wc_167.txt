<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction — fascination with the mundane vs. desire to share wonder — remains largely asserted, not dramatized; no moment forces a visible trade-off under pressure. The shift to “a new resolve” is thematic summary rather than embodied choice. Specific sensory handling earns credit, but the causal link between stone-throw epiphany and workshop return feels unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing — reframing of vocation — but the cost is abstract (“tranquility”) rather than concrete; lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern holds. Orientation is prompt and clear. No friction at closure, yet the causal beat between pond insight and workshop decision is elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Selective dawn detail (scalloped bay, dew-webs, prism mist) is vivid, character-focalized, and supports tonal shift. Micro-setting (pond between boulders) becomes the moment of最贵sion; its specificity constraints the final sense-making. Tight economy, though “harbor glazier” tools play only contextual role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake — how daily craft will change — is fuzzy; no external pressure tests it. Prism appears and beckons but does not complicate or tighten options. Pattern break (stone-pond communion) provides the single cadence shift; escalation remains gentle-to-abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thematic concept — beauty overlooked in the ordinary — emerges through image, not lecture, and is persistently refracted in closing cascade. Subtext quietly grieves modern haste. Final paragraph swerves from earned resonance into overt aspiration (“sacred resolve”), trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrism is purposeful and accretive; accruing mirrored, fractured light teaches the pattern. POV modulation between tactile and metaphysical grounded in occupation. Rhythm breathes without drumbeat; minor fixed-beginning loops (“as the...”) cost half a tick.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft fluent and evocative (cut-glass hands, noctilucent reckoning). Occasional layered modifiers cloud near peak beats (“hypnotic dance... generative futures”). Zero clarity breaks; occasional filter-verb cluster avoided. Minimal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Craft-level essay frame (mundane beauty) is familiar but transformed by sensory specificity within a miniature vocation observatory. No stock dialogue or cliché heroics; hinge scene relies on pattern-seeing rather than dazzling twist, achieving understated originality. Fresh angle: glazier ↔ interpreter of light vectors.</comment>
