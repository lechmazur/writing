<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Guardian’s interiority is embodied in the tactile dance of shutters and mirror; the spiraling calm is both trait and tool, constraining every micro-choice. The visitor’s half-spoken secret functions as external pressure, but the guardian’s motives remain abstract—no visible contradiction or cost surfaces before the final nod. Earned stasis is hinted at yet not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final star pattern crystallizes the unspoken secret’s weight and reconfigures both characters’ options without words. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shutter adjustment deepens pattern density until the last image reframes the night. Cost is felt in the visitor’s transformed silence, though the guardian’s personal price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, rain-slick shutters, and dental mirror form a micro-setting that actively constrains tactics: every angle of reflected light depends on physical placement. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the guardian’s ritual precision; the mirror’s gleam and the planks’ color charge the final star image. Spatial choreography is seamless; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the unspoken secret rupture the ritual?—is signaled early and tightens through each shutter click. Escalation is accretive: patterns grow denser, stillwater tension mounts, visitor’s step forward/back reveals cost. Agency resides in the guardian’s refusal to break silence, foreclosing verbal resolution; price is the continued burden of secrecy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: light needs shadow, silence carries meaning. Subtext lives in the mirror’s refractions and the visitor’s aborted step. Final spiral galaxy on the dock offers a resonant, non-literal answer—patterns within patterns—without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy epiphany intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, ritualistic; syntax lengthens and contracts like breath. Free indirect style stays locked to the guardian’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision (“spiralingly calm”) are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. Distinctive diction—“stillwater tension,” “cobalt planks”—anchors the lyric texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with the guardian’s measured pace, accelerating subtly as dawn nears. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ancient duty”) is earned by mythic frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror as star-caster, shutters as loom, silence as pedagogy. Risky lyric mode commits fully and pays off in the final star pattern. Specificity of place and tool prevents abstraction; the premise could not survive transplantation. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
