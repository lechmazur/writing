<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but the “chaste courtesan” label is asserted more than dramatized; her clients’ off-stage conversions feel summarized rather than witnessed. The final step into the sanctuary is earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s integration into the chorus of echoes—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern of thread-untying is taught early and paid off, though the exact moment of cost is diffuse rather than pinpointed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and snow function as both literal stage and metaphorical crucible; the snowflakes in her hair charge the final image. Spatial anchors are clear, and the setting subtly constrains movement and visibility, though the prism itself remains more visionary than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberation from conformity—escalates through each loosened thread, tightening the emotional cost. One clear deepening occurs when the prism solidifies, forcing the choice to enter; the price is spiritual rather than material, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s embodied defiance and the chorus of historical echoes; no moral is stated. The final image of becoming “both lock and key” reweights the premise without abstraction, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature that filters every image through Elara’s poised rebellion. Patterned repetition (“between sigh and smile”) is taught early and modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, occasionally tipping into purple (“diamante witnesses”) but never obscuring causality. A few near-paraphrase loops (“threads…threads”) and stacked metaphors nudge it below the 8.5 threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The courtesan-ascetic paradox and the prism-as-state conceit feel fresh, synthesizing familiar tropes into a singular vision. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity; slight over-reliance on archetype keeps it from the top band.</comment>
