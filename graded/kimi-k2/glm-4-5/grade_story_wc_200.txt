<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his tactile handling of the tooth and bell, the embodied ache of his sister’s memory—but the “modest fearlessness” trait is asserted rather than tested; Thomas’s brief appearance supplies pressure yet remains more symbol than crucible. The final laugh crystallizes change, yet the cost to Elias feels generalized rather than personally stinging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Thomas’s dissolution is a decisive change charged with earned joy, and the lingering warmth of the tooth reconfigures Elias’s next steps. Causal chain holds—distorted notes → tooth → bell → release—though the middle beats glide rather than tighten. No orientation debt; gorge and sunrise anchors arrive early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Echo Gorge’s sonic distortions actively shape tactics; the misaligned harp is not mere scenery but the mechanism by which the ghost hides and is found. Sensory detail is selective—lavender light, frayed strings—yet the cave micro-setting could be more tactile to push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing Thomas—escalates through each distorted note, narrowing to the cave confrontation. The cost is visible in Elias’s spent warmth and the absorbed shame inside the tooth, but the tightening beat feels gentle rather than irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of laughter as liberation emerges organically from Thomas’s confession and the bell’s chime; no moralizing intrudes. The luminous ache modulates into crystallized joy without tidy resolution for Elias’s own loss, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded in Elias’s collector idiom; perceptual signature is sharp—“pockets heavy with whispered regrets.” No POV drift, though occasional elevated phrasing (“ethereal glow”) edges toward register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density; only minor loops (“luminous ache” twice in close succession) and a few stacked modifiers dull the edge. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The soul-collector premise is familiar, yet the sonic-harp tracking mechanism and laughter-integration therapy give it fresh specificity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
