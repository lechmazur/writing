<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s tremor-riven hands, inner fracture, and final micro-shift are all built legitimately off each fold-back of the silent tapestry, giving us a believable arc of endurance/renunciation. The depth of her masked exterior is consistent; the one missing beat is her not actively miscalculating before success, toning down tragic consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causality unfolds like a braid: each unravelled knot raises stakes because it tightens silence & releases another wail, culminating in the earned stasis where the spirits are ‘grounded’ under starlight. One continuous scene, no causal breaks, and the closure unit lands cleanly.</comment>

<comment>Prism sanctuary doubles as pressure chamber—light bends under every spirit twitch—and the net’s seaweed shimmer palpably alters sight lines, shove-cuing Elena's final stance. While scale is modest for 800w, the detailed physical anchors function as micro-setting that constrains action.

<comment>Stakes escalate because every loosened knot tightens future silence; pressure coheres and a final single beat crystallises the spirits’ grounding. No off-stage rescue—choices are Elena’s own, earned.

<comment>Theme emerges through the quiet accumulation of unspoken grief; no epiphany but a charged poise at the end contradict the romantic trope of ‘letting go’. Subtext is in Jacob’s cracked whisper more than any didactic statement.

<comment>Elena’s interior monologue is precise without therapy-speak; patterns of perception mirror her tremor and the prism walls. Only voice merger at moments of spirit-wail still harmonises, because her needle rhythm remains dominant.

<comment>Sentence rhythm accelerates with each knot; no ornamental dludge except one minor “prismatic kaleidoscope” phrase that snaps back in. High clarity under pressure.

<comment>Mask-restorer meets spirit-speaker is a fresh synthetic pivot: craft becomes ritual. Risk lies in skipping Elena's concrete error, yet the quiet inversion—suffering instead of being cured—feels inevitable.
