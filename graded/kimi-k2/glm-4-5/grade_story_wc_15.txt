<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s haunting optimism is stated but never embodied in contradictory action; her sleepwalking is passive and the final “purpose” is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice. Interiority drifts into summary (“she knew she had found her purpose”) instead of concrete, embodied stakes. No visible cost is paid on the page for her transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Closure is a summary assertion rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the “new precedents” are declared, not dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence shift is missing a felt cost. Orientation is clear, yet causality between plate, sleepwalking, and communal pilgrimage is elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Red canyon walls, tide-pool emptiness, and sprouting orchids are vividly rendered and thematically coherent. However, the labyrinth itself never physically constrains Elara’s choices; it serves as backdrop rather than active pressure. Micro-setting (needle, thread) is handled tactilely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“transform ruin into reverence”—is declared early, but escalation is narrated rather than tested through a narrowing choice. No on-page reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the village’s adoption is reported, not earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of art healing history emerges organically from imagery, yet the final paragraph moralizes (“she had created new ones…”) instead of letting the blooming labyrinth speak. Subtext is present but undercut by explicit thesis statements late in the text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a poetic cadence that suits Elara’s wharf-weaver lens. Occasional elevated diction (“dragon spines,” “orchid solace”) risks purple but stays within pattern. No POV drift or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet occasionally loops—“sew the old ways into new meanings” followed by “transforming ruin into reverence” restates without deepening. Metaphors are coherent, but density in final paragraphs slows momentum. Clean grammar and strong sensory verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of sleepwalking, textile art, and living labyrinth is fresh; avoids clichés of magical maps. Risk lies in lyric summary over dramatized turns, but the synthesis feels specific to Elara’s world. Not a template plot.</comment>
