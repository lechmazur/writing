<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her finger feels the chameleon’s tail tighten, her smile is “genuine for the first time”—but the betrayal is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the contradiction that should drive her. The final stance is earned, yet the partner’s absence keeps the relationship crucible off-stage, limiting pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the mist, lantern light, and chameleon’s color shifts layer density until the dawn lift reweights trust from absolute to chosen. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—“she had found a way forward”—with felt cost in her first real smile. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The workshop’s mist, lantern glow, and skylight stars are filtered through Elara’s selective attention; the chameleon’s tail tip acts as micro-setting that constrains her metaphor of shedding layers. Final image of dawn lifting mist reconfigures the emotional space, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to trust again—tightens once: from shattered conviction to conscious choice. The pressure is internal and coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the ongoing labor of balancing self-respect and compassion, visible in her dawn smile. No external reversals, but one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reconstruction-through-shedding emerges from the chameleon’s literal molt and Elara’s metaphorical one, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the healed tail reweights prior betrayal into transformation, offering resonant ambiguity rather than a tidy lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices scale micro-structure and condensation drips, not room dimensions. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, textured, and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined: “quietly vivid display,” “shimmering stillness” serve atmosphere without purple drift. One paraphrase loop (“reconstructing isn’t about forgetting… it’s about transformation”) is minor. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no line-level artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The chameleon-as-healer motif refreshes the betrayal-recovery arc; the parallel between tail-mend and spirit-mend feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of wildlife-handler detail grounds the trope. No close echoes; risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
