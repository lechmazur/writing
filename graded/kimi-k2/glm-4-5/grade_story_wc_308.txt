<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael’s centuries-long absorption and reverence are shown through tactile ritual—trembling hands, bare feet in dust—but his interiority drifts toward abstract pronouncements (“something nameless within his spirit”). The final renunciation is earned yet stated more than dramatized; the cost is felt but not embodied in a last gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo, stone, and bird pattern layers density until the arrowhead’s pulse reconfigures the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Kael’s disappearance and the arrowhead’s new role—though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon dust, and circular depression are vivid and selective; the arrowhead and stones act as micro-settings that constrain Kael’s final placement. Spatial choreography is coherent; the environment’s hum and shimmer guide choice, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightens through layered sensory pressure. The crows’ arrow formation and the arrowhead’s activation provide a single meaningful deepening that narrows options, though the cost is more metaphysical than tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-as-journey emerges organically from Kael’s ritual and the arrowhead’s resonance. Final image of the pulsing arrowhead reweights prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers, inviting reflection on timelessness and continuity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, archaic, and consistent; perceptual signature is Kael’s—he feels dust “bearing memories,” sees “sky-writings.” Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“historically reverent”) edges toward register drift but remains within the mythic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“pulse left wandering,” “centuries of layered dust”) that accumulates texture. A few near-paraphrase loops (“navigate without moving” restated) and stacked metaphors (“saltwater meeting ancient earth”) slightly dull momentum, but clarity at closure is intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of stone-skimming as dimensional navigation, bone towers as antennae, and birds as living runes. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric, mythic compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor echoes of familiar quest tropes remain.</comment>
