<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is warm but generic; the therapist’s “decisively kind” stance is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. Only one clear micro-choice—continuing to play after death—earns cost, but it feels pre-ordained, not wrestled with. Relationships are sketched, not crucibles; no status shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the final image of the son holding the shard while music continues reconfigures grief into continuity (Charged Poise). Causal chain is thin—music therapy doesn’t materially alter outcome—but the accumulative pattern of scent, sound, and shard holds. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Radiant haven above the clouds” is evocative but functions as postcard backdrop; it doesn’t constrain choices. The cedar chest and lavender lotion, however, anchor sensory memory and return in the final scent, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clear; no weather or physics violations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—flawless goodbye—tightens as death nears, but agency is observational; therapist’s only decisive act is to keep playing. Cost is emotional, not tactical. Pressure escalates via breathing-as-metronome, a subtle but legible intensification under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “reunification through fragments” emerges organically from vinyl shard, broken family, and music. No moralizing; final image reweights the shard from ruin to relic. Subtext in the son’s impossible promise (“when you’re feeling better”) is sharp. Resonance lingers without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, lyrical, consistent; perceptual signature notices scent, sound, and texture with hospice precision. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural (“I’ll fix it, Dad”). Occasional elevated diction (“hymning the mundane”) risks register drift but stays within therapist’s reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Few loops; one paraphrase loop (“pulsing stillness” twice) is minor. Metaphors (“metronome counting what’s left”) are apt. No scaffolding or purple patches. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—hospice music therapy reuniting father and son via broken vinyl—is fresh but not radical. Tropes (uplifting hospice, vinyl nostalgia) are warmed rather than transformed. Specificity of scent and sound helps, yet story could transplant to another hospice with minor edits. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
