<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor’s interiority is vivid—her fingers “dancing” over documents, the pen nib “tapping her chin”—but the emotional contradiction between legacy guilt and investigative zeal is summarized more than dramatized. The final resolve to “write the truth” is credible yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested from genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: journalist’s call → retreat to observatory → proof-by-contradiction → dawn breakthrough. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eleanor’s stance crystallizes with the rosewood pen as symbol of reclaimed legacy. Cost is implied in the sleepless night and the risk of confronting power, though not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is more than backdrop; its curved walls bounce Eleanor’s questions back at her, literalizing the proof-by-contradiction method. The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting, constraining her tactics (she must write, not shout). Sensory detail is selective—star-filled dome, pink-gold dawn—filtered through her focused gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—clearing Davies and exposing the real culprit—escalates through Eleanor’s single night of deduction. One meaningful tightening occurs when she flips the assumption of guilt, narrowing her options to a single logical path. The cost is intellectual exhaustion and future political risk, legible but not yet visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-responsibility emerges organically from Eleanor’s handling of her father’s tools and unfinished work. The final image of the pen nib poised to “write the truth” reweights earlier regret into duty without moralizing. Subtext in the echoed whispers suggests the observatory itself tests her resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“solemn playfulness” modulates from wistful memory to steely focus. Free-indirect style stays anchored in Eleanor’s educated, meticulous diction. No dialogue, yet the internal monologue carries subtext and goal pursuit cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparing and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial maps and half-written articles”) fits the POV. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds through the night.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of investigative thriller with intimate legacy grief feels fresh; the proof-by-contradiction device is woven into both plot and setting. Specificity of the newsprint dynasty and cloud-top observatory grounds the concept. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
