<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied—trembling fingers, tears, the way he “breathed deeply” at the end—yet the epiphany that “it wasn’t the smells themselves” arrives as summary rather than dramatized contradiction, blunting the final cost. The grief-driven motivation is consistent, but the moment of renunciation (embracing rather than resisting memory) is asserted more than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elias’s stance crystallizes from avoidance to acceptance, signaled by placing the vial on display—an Earned Stasis with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each scent layer tightens the emotional density until the final image reweights the premise. Midnight bloom and dawn light frame the single-scene window without orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, ultraviolet lantern, and perfume vial function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the lantern’s beam literally reveals hidden scent-memories, and the vial’s placement at the end charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—lavender, rain-soaked earth, camellias—each tied to a specific memory beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will Elias face or flee the sensory memories—tightens once, decisively, when the ultraviolet lantern forces confrontation. The cost is felt in real-time tears and the final act of display, which forecloses avoidance. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as both wound and gift, light and shadow interdependent. The final image of crystal shadows dancing with morning light offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the trembling fingers, the careful placement of the vial—rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates under scent-triggered emotion. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices through an olfactory lens, and the prose’s diction (“aromatically cautious,” “crystal shadows”) stays within his lexicon. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences often do double duty (“The vial, empty of its original fragrance, still held memories in its molecular structure”). Minor loop risk in repeated “crystal shadows” phrasing, but it serves pattern rather than redundancy. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of extinct flora, olfactory memory, and ultraviolet revelation feels fresh and inevitable. The ghost orchid’s moon-timed bloom is not mere ornament; it catalyzes the final transformation. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
