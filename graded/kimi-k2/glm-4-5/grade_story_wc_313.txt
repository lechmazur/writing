<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thomas’s “precisely humane” trait is dramatized when he chooses to overturn the official narrative, paying the cost of complicity; interiority is embodied in the tactile handling of the label and the quiet phone calls. The final stance crystallizes with visible moral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Thomas commits to public truth-telling, foreclosing his quiet complicity; the causal chain (label → photograph → phone calls) is tight and legible under a Causal lens. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway and receding water constrain movement and frame the final image; the liqueur label and wind-chime silence function as micro-settings that charge the choice. Specificity is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus complicity—is signaled early; the resurfacing town tightens the moral pressure, forcing Thomas’s decisive action. Cost is visible in the phone calls and the relinquished quiet life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed truth emerges organically from Thomas’s choices and the photographs; the final image of sunlight on rooftops offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext operates in the silent chime and mirrored hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, weathered, and consistent with a solitary warden; perceptual signature shows in “mirrored hush” and the selective noticing of glints and labels. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, no register drift. Sentences advance story or atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The submerged-town premise is familiar, but the warden’s archival activism and the liqueur-label trigger give it fresh inflection. Specificity of the aunt’s defiant photograph transforms stock material.</comment>
