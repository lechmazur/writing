<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anu’s frugality, faith-science tension, and embodied awe are vivid; the final covenant moment crystallizes his arc with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the “empirically ironic” label is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Anu’s palms glow with covenant marks, sealing a path with felt cost. Causal chain (tile → schematic → ritual → revelation) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Observatory-palace, clay shards, and candlelit tile anchor space; the tile itself constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective, but “dusky harmony” edges toward atmospheric cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking the tile before Nebuchadnezzar arrives—tightens once when the equinox window narrows. Agency drives escalation; cost is the irreversible covenant etched into Anu’s hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-faith synthesis emerges through Anu’s encrypted devotion and final transcendence; no moralizing. The glowing symbols on his palms reweight prior material with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a scholar’s diction and mystic cadence. Compression and elision are taught early (“Between regimes…”) and paid off in the final light. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“cooled honey beneath his fingers”) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian astronomy, magic squares, and regime change; the tile’s origami-unfolding into star-pathways feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
