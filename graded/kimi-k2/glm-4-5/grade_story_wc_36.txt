<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eldrin’s interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tears) and his micro-choice to uncase the flute is the hinge; yet the “spectacular failure” is only asserted, not dramatized, so the contradiction between pride and guilt is told rather than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the flute feels “lighter, yet immeasurably more precious,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each driftwood placement and note deepens pattern until the final silence. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is vivid and selective; the “avalanchingly quiet” hush modulates from menace to benediction. The driftwood spiral and canyon walls constrain Eldrin’s ritual movements, charging the final image of the silent canyon within him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming failure through insight—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as each melody reveals a new layer of guilt; the final silence forecloses the path of self-recrimination. Cost is visible in tears and the relinquished driftwood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption-through-failure emerges organically; no moralizing. The canyon’s hush becoming an internal silence offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The flute’s re-weighted meaning charges the closure without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature filters detail through Eldrin’s ritual focus. No head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional crests—long sentences during visions, short releases at the end—without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“telluric energies,” “pearlescence”) slightly exceeds the POV’s lexicon but never muddies clarity. Strong verbs anchor every beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of sound-magic and geologic silence feels fresh; driftwood-as-memory-map is a specific, non-obvious device. The transformation of “guardianship” from control to healing reframes a familiar redemption arc with earned insight.</comment>
