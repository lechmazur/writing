<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—fever, snow on the floor, the leaden stomach—but the “swallowed truth” remains abstract, blunting the final choice. His fault-tolerance is asserted rather than dramatized; no moment shows him functioning despite missing data. The smudging micro-choice is concrete and stakes-revealing, yet the cost of walking into the night feels more atmospheric than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias steps into the auroral night carrying both burden and purpose, the sorrow now externalized. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each margin smudged adds density until the map coheres. One causality gap: how the swallowed meteoric fragment was ingested is elided, but the final image reweights the premise without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station’s cold floor, blown-in snow, and spectrograph arrays are tactile and selective. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, its margins literally guiding choice. Aurora-as-tears risks symbolism overload, yet the image is saved by its integration into the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the swallowed truth—tightens once: smudging reveals coordinates that foreclose lingering in safety. Cost is felt in the “shaking hands” and the night’s bite, but the price remains more atmospheric than visceral. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of liminal certainties emerges through concrete acts—smudging edges, reading margins—rather than assertion. The auroral sorrow reweights the premise at closure without moralizing. One near-miss: “neither fate nor free will truly existed” flirts with thesis-statement, but the surrounding imagery rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, scientific yet lyric, matching Elias’s vocation and altered state. Perceptual signature is strong—he notices “discoloration at the illustration’s margin” while fever-fogged. No dialogue, so compression and rhythm carry the narrative; occasional elevated diction (“celestial tears”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers pressure. Minor loop: “truths that fell as condensation rather than precipitation” restates the same idea twice. Otherwise, rhythm modulates with scene needs, and figurative language is purposeful. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope with auroral physics and cartographic mysticism. The margin-as-map device feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction pays off because the final image crystallizes stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
