<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and inherited duty are clear, but interiority stays at summary level; no moment of embodied contradiction under pressure. The final commitment is stated rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a quiet CR—walls’ dreams now include her voice—but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivy, stone, and rain are vivid and selective; the fireplace micro-setting constrains the discovery beat. Yet no environmental detail tightens the final choice or charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes—preserve architectural memory—are signaled early and deepen with each artifact. Pressure accumulates but never forces a live trade-off; the ending is acceptance rather than narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Theme of walls as living memory emerges organically from diaries and negative. Final image offers quiet resonance, yet a touch of explanatory “what walls dream about” edges toward thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias. Occasional elevated diction (“sensitively perceptive”) feels slightly academic amid otherwise embodied prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, but “echo cartographer” and “legacy’s burden” repeat without pattern payoff; minor scaffold near the end dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic archaeology and post-climate ruin; the film-negative bridge between sound and image feels inevitable. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold twist—but coherent.</comment>
