<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the parole memory and the act of tracing patterns reveal layered motives. The final realization—stories begin in absence—earns its cost through the vendor’s century of confinement and nightly renewal ritual. Micro-choices (selecting shards, forming the door) visibly enact the hierarchy of values. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the door’s creation reweights the premise that stories start in absence, with parole’s nightly cost still looming. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of moonlight bottles and memory shards tightens toward the crystallized final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint (parole renewal) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass orchard library is vivid, selective, and purposeful; every detail (transparent branches, bottled moonlight) constrains the vendor’s ritual choices. The floating cloud-sea and crystalline fruits charge the final image of the door appearing in empty air. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static repetition. Environment directly shapes the incising action and the earned insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—tightens once when the vendor realizes absence is the source. Pressure grows through the parole ritual’s nightly cost and the failed visitor breach; no external coincidence resolves anything. The final act of incising the door crystallizes stance with visible cost (parole limits). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stories arise from what is unsaid/absent. Subtext operates in the whisper from the crescent bottle and the unvoiced wishes in glass birds. Final image reframes prior fragments without moralizing. Complexity lingers—emptiness as generative—without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the vendor’s cautious wonder. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during ritual. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Purposeful elision (exact parole crime) imposes later friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“bottled moonlight humming with forgotten promises”). Rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing” moment) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—floating library of bottled moonlight and parole storytelling—is fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (memory shards, glass orchard) are transformed through sensory specificity and causal weight. Final reconfiguration feels earned, not gimmicky. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
