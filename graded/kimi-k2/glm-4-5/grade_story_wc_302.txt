<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative ("veiled dreamer adjusted their diaphanous covering") and embodied, but the character’s contradictory impulses remain abstract; no micro-choice under pressure is dramatized until the final “step back,” which is reported rather than enacted. Motivation is clear—find the library—but the internal stakes never tighten visibly on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch ticks forward normally, the library fades, and the seeker leaves with “another unspoken truth.” Cost is felt—the mystery is spent—yet the causality between cipher fragments and final access remains lightly sketched. Orientation is clear; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glowing mist-library is vividly rendered (“organic as a living thing…soft internal luminescence”) and constrains the final choice: the mist walls part only when the watch pulses, then reseal. Sensory selection is purposeful; fog density governs access and timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the library before closure—signals early and tightens once when the watch vibrates urgently. However, the protagonist’s agency is largely observational; the final step away is a renunciation without visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the power of silence and unspoken words is embodied in the floating manuscripts and the seeker’s journal. Final image—“another unspoken truth”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is present but could cut deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and character-specific (“spectral garments,” “diaphanous covering”). No dialogue appears; prose texture carries the dreamlike tone. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and rhythmic; occasional ornate phrasing (“cautious exuberance,” “spectral garments”) skirts overwriting but remains purposeful. No loops or scaffold detected. High information density with clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The Library of Unspoken Words is a fresh synthesis of Borgesian and dream-logic tropes, grounded in tactile detail. The cipher/watch mechanic is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; originality lies in texture, not structural daring.</comment>
