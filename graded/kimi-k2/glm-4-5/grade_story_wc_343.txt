<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity is vivid and embodied—tracing the hopscotch squares, cross-referencing the phrasebook—but the interior contradiction never sharpens into a felt cost; the ending celebrates rather than tests his drive, so the change reads as triumph, not renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Eli’s deciphering reconfigures the sky’s map and his own future. The causal chain (hopscotch → cipher → light → discovery) holds, and the final image crystallizes new possibility with visible stakes. Minor slack: the “next great discovery” refrain edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique airship’s brass and wood, the dusty hopscotch board, and the trapped beam of light are tactile and selective; the hopscotch board constrains Eli’s method and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting discovery—is signaled early and tightens once when Eli deciphers the pattern; the cost is conceptual (his isolation may end) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of pattern-seeking and containment emerges organically from Eli’s actions; the starlings and light reprise at the end reweight the premise without moralizing. A touch of tidy uplift keeps it from deeper resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eli’s perceptual quirks—his “diligently curious” noticing, the dog-eared page as talisman. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic lift at the murmuration beats; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional soft fillers (“mesmerizing dance,” “strange kinship”) are minor. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density is high without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hopscotch-cipher-light synthesis feels fresh and inevitable; the antique airship setting is familiar but transformed through Eli’s precise, apprentice-level engagement. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
