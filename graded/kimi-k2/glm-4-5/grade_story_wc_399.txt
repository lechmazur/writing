<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The line walker’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“eyes that saw between worlds while remaining grounded”), but the cost of isolation is asserted rather than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is staged in-scene, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the consecrated clearing persists with felt cost (“continuity with the past meant isolation in the present”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of whispers, sand, and parapet resonance tightens to final image—yet causality between prophet’s arrival and walker’s urgency is more asserted than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet are sensuously specific (“sand outside…held memories”), and the parapet’s subterranean motion directly enables the ritual; however, the environment does not physically constrain the walker’s choices—its role is facilitative rather than limiting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo—is clear early; pressure escalates via ritual intensity and parapet resonance, narrowing to the moment of consecration. Cost is legible (“isolation in the present”), but the prophet’s off-stage presence weakens direct antagonistic force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship versus solitude emerges organically from the walker’s embodied labor; final image of “truth could grow wild like flowers” offers resonant non-literal reweighting. Occasional abstract phrasing (“wisdom often hides in liminal spaces”) slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and selective sensory detail; “peripheral awareness” functions as a perceptual signature. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; occasional elevated diction (“kinetic parapet resonated in harmony”) fits the ceremonial register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but figurative layering sometimes overloads (“living architecture beneath the sands”). No loops or scaffold, yet a few mixed metaphors (“circuit of power untouched for centuries”) momentarily blur physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of desert mysticism and kinetic archaeology feels fresh; the “conjured clearing” as portable sanctuary is a non-obvious device. Risk-taking lies in lyric compression and ritual pacing; payoff lands without gimmickry, though echoes of familiar mystic tropes remain.</comment>
