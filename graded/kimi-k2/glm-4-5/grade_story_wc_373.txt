<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza’s motive—“to capture the sound of trust breaking”—is eccentric yet consistent; her micro-choices (false rumors, direct lie) escalate with visible cost. Interiority is concrete but occasionally drifts toward label-speak (“curiously steadfast”). The final renunciation (slipping away with the recorded silence) forecloses further action and carries felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: each rumor narrows Malachi’s options until the forged note triggers the decisive fracture. Closure lands on-page as Eliza captures the silence and exits before gunfire—earned stasis with cost. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The rotting-pier market is sketched with selective sensory cues (creaking wood, hush, rum barrels) that guide movement and concealment. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the watch fob doubles as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but environment never actively thwarts her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—record betrayal before sunrise—tightens with each rumor; the lie about patrol schedules is the single meaningful escalation that fractures the truce. Cost is legible: alliance shattered, shots imminent, Eliza’s exit marks irreversible change. Agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of trust as audible artifact emerges through action rather than statement; the silence after betrayal becomes the resonant image. Subtext in hushed negotiations and parrot-side glances enriches without moralizing. Final reconfiguration—Eliza owns the “silence that screams”—offers conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice is consistent, with salty diction (“moonshine runner,” “planks”) and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters through Eliza’s risk-calculating mind. Dialogue snippets serve subtext and goal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, free of loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“uncanny ability to navigate the shadows”) edges toward cliché but never stalls momentum. Sentence variety supports tension; no artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: bootleg dynasty meets sonic ethnography of betrayal. The antique recorder trope is transformed into a literalized metaphor that charges the ending. Specificity of pirate market under rotting pier grounds the conceit; risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
