<comment>Elias’s interiority is consistent but drifts toward tidy self-explication (“understood that some truths transcended classification”), blunting the bite of embodied contradiction. The inherited-stamp revelation is strongly anchored in micro-gestures (fingers on ridges, sudden re-weight in the palm) and drives a single, credible stance change, yet the emotional cost is articulated more than genuinely felt. Occupation details remain atmospheric rather than shaping tactical decisions under blackout, so professional flaw pressure never fully hits.</comment>

<comment>The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s decision to become “a bridge between past and present” crystallizes new identity options and carries unmistakable social-cost (ancestral lineage exposed, old methodology renounced). Causal linkage is clear—stamp → sigil match → hypothesis → map fragments → identity rewrite. No orientation debt; blackout duration and spatial anchors remain crisp. One residual looseness: the final beat of “everyone tracing their own honest origins” is gestural rather than dramatized, preventing a higher-tier score.</comment>

<comment>The sunken library is atmospherically rich—“dappled sunlight through water” on emergency LEDs, tactile waterproof scrolls—but functions primarily as mood architecture rather than environmental constraint; no beat is limited by pressure, water ingress, or navigation of the tunnel system. The stamp serves an effective micro-setting role in the closing tableau, recharging the image, earning the upward nudge.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>A single coherent stake is maintained: legitimacy of ancestral origins through textual proof. Escalation unfolds as an accumulative deepening—each fragment raises the cost of clinging to prior self-definition and forecloses retreat to the old paradigm. The cost lands: Elias must abandon the dispassionate indexer persona he values. No external antagonist is required; the pressure of revelation is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The theme of reclaimed stillness versus archival certainty emerges through pattern rather than statement—each scroll demands reliance on hand and eye instead of screens—until the final paragraph explicitly verbalizes the insight. The ending image of stamp-as-talisman recalibrates meaning, but an over-articulated line dilutes subtext resonance.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: Elias notices fiber grain under fingertips, “minute details in handwriting,” and calibrated diction that suits a logician, not a tourist narrator. There are no dialogue exchanges on-page, so voice integrity is judged by interior texture alone; it holds without leakage.</comment>

<grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Prose is largely clean, with purposeful sentence variety and rhythmic lift. Mild accumulative flaw: several consecutive near-synonyms (“tranquilly perceptive,” “perceptive nature,” “calm detachment”) across adjacent lines amount to paraphrase loop, dulling peak tension by 0.3 points. Otherwise, imagery is efficient and grammar impeccable.</comment>

<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>The genealogical twist—librarian discovers he descends from those he catalogs—is not wholly original, yet its grounding in the specific underwater archive and antique stamp lends sufficient freshness. Risk factor: the coincidence of stamp-matching sigil edges toward contrivance, lightly muted because it surfaces during an expected research mission.</question>
