<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her bare feet gripping the smooth stone where friction had long since disappeared”), but the mentor’s dying promise is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the emotional cost at the climax. The final renunciation—patterns are to be harmonized with, not controlled—earns its turn through the ritual sequence, yet the mentor’s absence keeps the relational crucible off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-dust sphere crystallizes a new stance (“its power now integrated with her consciousness”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the line “though she remained precognitively cursed, the visions no longer tormented her.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless stone are tactile and selective; the vial and painted stones act as micro-settings that constrain ritual placement. The environment’s lack of friction directly shapes how star dust behaves, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill the promise to understand sacred patterns—tightens through each stone placement; the Fibonacci-golden-ratio escalation reweights the cost. Agency is ritual action; the final stance crystallizes when she renounces control. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: harmony over control. The infinity stone and eels’ mirrored patterns reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—star dust returning voluntarily—rather than statement. Final image reframes prior visions as guidance, not torment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the herder’s ritual focus. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during star-dust eruption, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers action, image, and concept. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. Metaphors (“borrowed dawn”) are consistent and earned. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frictionless world, eel-herding mathematics, and collapsed star dust synthesize into a fresh cosmology. The premise commits fully; no retreat to safe tropes. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of painted stones and eel choreography anchors universals.</comment>
