<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of the locket, her childhood echo in Lila’s posture—but the moment she chooses to use the eclipse as therapy feels slightly convenient rather than compelled by flaw or contradiction. Lila’s first words arrive as earned release, yet the story hedges the cost by framing healing as gentle inevitability rather than risk-laden choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the eclipse beat produces a Decisive Change—Lila speaks—framed as Resonant Reconfiguration of Maya’s own past silence. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; the gradual layering of musical attempts crests in the charged hush of totality, and the cost is the fragility Maya names—“a newly opened flower that might close again.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sage ridge, the drifting fragrance, and the locket form a micro-setting that constrains choice: the ridge’s exposed height dictates the eclipse vantage, the locket’s weight steadies Maya’s resolve. Sensory detail is selective—cooling air, aromatic brush—integrated through action rather than catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing Lila’s voice—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each musical session fails until the eclipse offers a once-only acoustic hush. The cost is implicit but felt: Maya risks retraumatizing herself by replaying her own childhood loss. Agency is Maya’s decision to lead Lila to the ridge; coincidence (eclipse) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through the eclipse-as-music metaphor rather than statement; the final whispered line reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—Maya’s past, Lila’s present—handled with restraint. Minor drift toward therapeutic platitude (“healing isn’t linear”) slightly blunts resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is warm, tactile, and musically cadenced; free indirect style stays rooted in Maya’s perception. Compression is purposeful—sessions summarized in rhythmic fragments. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual; Lila’s first words carry double weight because the prose has withheld speech until the charged hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with rhythmic variation that mirrors musical phrasing. Occasional soft filler (“something special will happen”) and one mixed metaphor (“anchors in stormy seas”) are minor. No loops or scaffold; sensory nouns and verbs carry the load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The eclipse-as-therapy device is fresh yet feels inevitable in hindsight; the sage ridge and locket ground it in lived specificity. Risk is moderate—quiet lyricism over spectacle—but avoids cliché. Could edge higher with sharper edge of danger or irreversible cost.</comment>
