<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her sentimental box, mentor memory, and spiral-recognition all feel particular—but the final beat (“perfect balance… now a permanent part of her being”) is asserted rather than embodied, softening the earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the transformed crystal levitates, then settles, marking the before/after of her quest. Causal chain (dream → starlings → crystal → flame) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor slack in the “as if summoned” coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard, waterfall, and starling sky are rendered with selective sensory density that mirrors Elara’s dual lens; the crystal’s light refracting through her hair charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightened once when the starlings’ pattern crystallizes the method; the cost is conceptual (irreversible shift in worldview) but less viscerally felt than ideal for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of synthesis emerges organically from the starling geometry and crystal transformation; the final image reframes the premise without moralizing. A hairline slip: “ancient freshness” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the spiral recognition; perceptual signature (“molten copper,” “prismatic spray”) remains consistent. No dialogue, so voice purity is unchallenged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; only minor loop (“the touch of wonder she had been seeking—that moment where scientific understanding merged with mystical experience”) restates without new pressure. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar alchemist-in-orchard frame is refreshed by starling-generated method and sentimental secret; synthesis of logic/intuition feels specific to Elara. Risk is moderate—ornamented lyricism rather than structural daring.</comment>
