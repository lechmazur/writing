<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—shunned yet indispensable—animates the portrait, but the evolution from isolation to acceptance-of-duty is asserted rather than dramatized in on-page choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens; anniversary sketches repeat and deepen, yielding thematic closure—an Earned Stasis that reverberates with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Time-shrunk “wastelands,” the deck’s humming machines, and the glowing compass create vivid constraint; micro-setting objects (charts, gilded rose) directly charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve astronomical legacy—remains abstract; pressure intensifies elegiacally through ritual repetition rather than via narrowed options or felt forfeiture on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy-as-guidance emerges through lineage ritual and stellar mapping; final line reweights compass image without sermonizing, leaving ambiguity and resonance intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric cadence and sensory selection match Elara’s altered temporal lens; occasional register nudge (“cartographer of hope”) is a minor ripple that serves poetic urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Vivid compression, purposeful repetition, tight imagery—yet minor loops such as “true north…where to look” dampen final breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Post-collapse astral cartography feels fresh, but familiar “last astronomer tending the flame” tropes tug grade downward.</question>
