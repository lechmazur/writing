<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is clear and embodied (“fingers traced,” “consumed every waking hour”), but interior contradiction is stated rather than dramatized; the final choice to transmit is motivated yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally lacerating.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because she deciphers the pattern, therefore she recalibrates, therefore the signal stops. Closure lands with a visible shift—silence in the room and town—though the cosmic tricksters’ possible retaliation is more hinted than priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cramped studio’s vintage dials and blue pulse constrain her movements and charge the final hush; campus unrest outside is sketched economically. Micro-setting works, yet the wider town remains a lightly sketched backdrop rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—humanity’s perception—signaled early and tightened when she risks rupturing equipment and drawing alien notice. One decisive escalation: the transmitter fires, the signal dies, the town begins to heal. Cost is implied in the “ethereal grit” moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of manipulated reality emerges through signal analysis and social fracture rather than exposition. Final silence reweights prior paranoia into fragile hope without moralizing. Subtext in back-channel whispers is effective, though the cosmic tricksters remain abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, scientifically literate yet haunted; perceptual signature shows in “whispers in between signals.” Compression is purposeful, rhythm modulates with tension. No dialogue, so no voice contamination; free-indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“cosmic precision,” “ethereal grit”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold, yet a few filter verbs dull immediacy. Final image lands cleanly without artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of SETI trope with social-media-style manipulation via subsonics. Specific astronomical charts and vintage gear ground the concept. Risky low-frequency gambit feels earned, not gimmick; cosmic tricksters remain tantalizingly off-stage.</comment>
