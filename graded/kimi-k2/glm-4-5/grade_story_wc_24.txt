<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arlo’s desire to hear clocks rather than merely count seconds is clearly stated, but his interiority flirts with stock phrases (“truly seeing”) and the final renunciation, though earned, is rendered gently rather than under embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Arlo’s new understanding reweights all prior time-measurement under the lens of lived stillness. The reversal of flow is on-page, cost is the abandonment of conventional timekeeping, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds across the re-configuration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The brass fittings, razor edges, reversed water, and fjord quiet are vivid and selective; the horizon itself serves only as a visual backdrop rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image, holding the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“what do clocks really measure?”—is signaled early and escalates via the literal reversal of flow. The tightening is a deepening of meaning rather than narrowing of options, fitting the Accumulative lens, though visible price is more conceptual than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The question of time’s nature emerges organically from concrete mechanics; final refrain “measure what we give them” reweights earlier observations with understated resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is quietly lyrical, syntactically varied, and consistent; the POV’s selective attention to hydraulic detail feels shepherd-specific, though occasional elevated phrasing edges toward universal profundity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene needs; minor abstractions (“measurements change...”) slightly dull immediacy, but no loops or redundancies obstruct clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The clock-tide fusion feels fresh and inevitable; “counting backwards” as method of comprehension is inventive, though stakes remain internal, capping at the bold-choice threshold.</comment>
