<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s “find the weight” drive is clear, interiority is tactile, but the final choice is passively received knowledge rather than an active renunciation; the cost feels post-hoc rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal linkage tightens: rumor → valve discovery → psychic intercept → vision → understanding. Closure is Earned Stasis (Marcus accepts the weight and walks away). Cost is felt, though less viscerally enacted.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Tunnel, valve, and radio transmit atmosphere; the valve warms to the touch and cools at dawn, linking it to discovery and closure. Spatial anchors are timely and clear.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Singular stake—uncover the swallowed truth—is escalated through discovery of voice (radio confession) and culminating vision, then lands in acceptance. Pressure coheres under causal frame.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—unspoken history and communal guilt—is rendered via ghost-shift metaphor and radio artifact, not declared. Ending reweights prior images with Charged Poise rather than editorial moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is strong—“practiced recklessness,” “drowsy alertness”—but occasional heightened diction drifts from Marcus’s grit. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene heat; a handful of metaphor clusters (“oppressive darkness” twice) and repetitive sensory filters blunt peak beats. Overall clear propulsion with minor artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Blends folklore podcast with urban-exploration noir; reframes “ghost machine” as collective guilt rather than gimmick. Specificity of the valve wheel grounds it in local history.</comment>
