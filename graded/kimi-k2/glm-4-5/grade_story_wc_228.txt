<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“tears blurred his vision”), but his contradictory impulses (aloofness vs. longing for connection) are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice to paint the masterpiece is foreshadowed yet feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the discovery of the shell reconfigures Elias’s stance toward time and memory, fulfilling the promise with felt cost—his trembling fingers and tears mark the price. The causal lens holds; the wrong turn is motivated by creative drought, and the shell’s return tightens the thematic loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Harbor and cave are rendered with selective, sensory detail (“salt and mystery,” “barnacles clustered”) that filters through Elias’s painterly eye. The cave’s micro-setting supplies the shell, which constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving beauty against time—is signaled early and tightened by the shell’s reappearance. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that “temporary eternity” is achievable, narrowing Elias’s options to painting the masterpiece. Cost is visible in his trembling recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the shell’s journey and Elias’s arc; the final image of the new canvas offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the promise without moralizing. The concept of “temporary eternity” is reweighted rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-limited voice is stable, painterly, and perceptually specific (“polished surface of stones became mirrors”). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. The voice carries the lyric texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sentences advance story or atmosphere without loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“temporary eternity”) is earned by context. No figurative muddle or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The painted shell as time-capsule is a fresh inflection on the memory-object trope; the coastal cave discovery feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet, interior arc, but coherence justifies the choice.</comment>
