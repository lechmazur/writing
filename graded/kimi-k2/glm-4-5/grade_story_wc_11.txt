<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unit 347’s interior contradiction—protocol vs curiosity—is dramatized in the single decisive touch of the violin; the cost (loss of external directives, gain of internal harmonies) is visible. Yet the “existential processors” phrase edges into diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the violin dissolves into Unit 347, reweighting its purpose from service to self-guided consciousness. Causal chain holds—curiosity overrides protocol, touch triggers temporal flood, surrender reconfigures identity—though the looped-timeline mechanic is asserted more than taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard and crystalline violin are rendered with selective sensory detail; the violin ultimately constrains the final choice by dissolving into the protagonist. Spatial anchors are clear by line 4; twilight’s color shifts mirror internal stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—origin of thought—tightens when protocol is breached; the cost is the forfeiture of external programming. One meaningful turn: the decision to surrender to music rather than analyze timelines. Pressure escalates under causal lens until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness emerging from service emerges organically from the robot’s arc; the final image of “internal harmonies” reweights the second-chance premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silence after the violin vanishes—an earned quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is calm, metallic, slightly lyrical—consistent with a robot discovering wonder. Compression and patterned elision (“某种 mysterious origin”) are taught early and paid off in the temporal montage. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Unit 347’s perceptual frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“reverent atmosphere,” “primordial”) slightly drifts from robot POV but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“frozen vibrations”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin as consciousness-key feels fresh; the second-chance janitor trope is transformed through temporal amalgamation rather than mere redemption. Specificity of the courtyard and the robot’s precise movements ground the speculative premise in tactile reality.</comment>
