<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“exquisite agony of a thought struggling to be born”), but the woman remains a cipher; her final reach is reported, not dramatized, blunting the cost of her liberation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon alone in Silas’s hand crystallizes the cost of the freed idea. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rotation thickens atmosphere until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crossroads and starlight are sensuously rendered and constrain Silas’s ritual; the ribbon’s transformation into starlight charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the imprisoned idea—tightens through ritual escalation; the cost is the dissolution of the lock of hair, a visible forfeiture that forecloses return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of liberation versus fear emerges organically from the ritual and the ribbon’s metamorphosis; the final whispered line offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters cosmic imagery through a locksmith’s tactile focus; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, propelling the ritual; occasional elevated phrasing (“cosmic possibility”) is earned by context and never muddles causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-as-psychonaut premise feels fresh; the hair-as-key device and star-guided ritual synthesize mythic and psychological registers into an inevitable final image.</comment>
