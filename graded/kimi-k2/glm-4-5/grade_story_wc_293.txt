<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning for legacy reunion vs. witnessing impossible amnesty—are embodied and acted upon. His “luminous disbelief” evolves into the lantern that carries him onto the scaffold, a visible micro-choice locking him into pursuit. The brother-shaped hole in his motivation is credible, but the brother is absent on-page; thus status/relationship crucible is unavailable. No internal contradiction surfaces in the final ascent, so the change reads more as submission than earned resolve, capping just short of 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: a pattern of intensifying image-pulses that reweights Elias’s world. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “sculpt possibility from the ashes of never” crystallizes as he steps among fluttering wraps that form wings. Orientation is anchored early by scenic pullout + note. Cost is subtly felt in the forfeiture of empirical certainty. Yet ambiguity lurks—pixelated mechanics unexplained—so the CR edges down a notch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Mountain air, flapping scaffold wrap, glass flake light—all constrain choices and charge the end. The “question-mark clouds” is a neat atmospheric mirror. Spatial clarity holds from pullout to scaffold ascent. Strong constraint on action, fulfilling the 9- gate for environment-as-tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept the impossible invitation—locks early, tightens as the scaffold map unveils, and pays out when he steps onto it. Micro-turn: recounting aloud shifts wrap-movement from passive to guiding. No redundant reversals; pressure deepens through image density. Cost: irrevocable surrender of empirical certainty, visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of amnesty-as-creation emerges through the accretion of vanishing figures and “sculpting possibility.” There is no overt moral—only the open question charged by the closing wing image. Subtext stays embodied; no sermonizing final paragraph. The reader is left to weigh whether redemption is bridge or abyss, satisfying complexity without tidy resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric diction—bridge-song, pixelated amnesty, luminous disbelief—belongs to a single perceptual signature and stays under tight psychic distance. Sentence rhythm breathes with Elias’s wonderment. No dialogue to distinguish, but internal voice carries the show. Compression and elision are patterned early (e.g., “notes hanging in air”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud ear passes; sentence lengths vary naturally. Occasional abstraction (“all songs converge”) risks drifting toward poise, but the final image concretizes the ascent. A single mixed metaphor (“sculpt possibility from ashes that had colored his life”) is noticeable but not fatal. No repeat loops, redundancy, nor clarity breaks. High density per line, advancing motive or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of Appalachian fiddle tradition, wet-plate photography, and glitch art yields an unexpected whole. The pixel-amnesty concept reframes mortality/transcendence without technobabble. Fresh risk paid in quiet surrender of cause. Close echoes of “bridge” trope offset by the specificity of scaffold-wrap wings. Still registers as transformed rather than borrowed.</comment>
