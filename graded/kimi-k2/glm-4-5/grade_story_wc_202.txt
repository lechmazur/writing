<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction (“anchors of intuition,” “eternal instant”) that blurs embodied stakes. The grandmother’s deathbed whisper is the only concrete emotional anchor; the rest is retrospective summary. Micro-choices are implied rather than dramatized in the present scene. Closure is felt, but the cost is more asserted than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of memory → market → painting reweights meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fragment fully solidifies, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One transition (childhood to market) is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Alchemist’s market is vivid, selective, and filtered through POV nostalgia. The swaying stalls and glowing potions constrain movement and mood. The lighthouse painting functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring silenced histories—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the fragment’s warmth near the painting forces the final unfastening. Cost is conceptual (accepting legacy) rather than tangible. Agency is present but abstract; no credible loss beyond symbolic transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational transmission emerges through objects and art rather than statement. Final image of the glowing fragment reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from “elusively tangible” to “fully present.” Avoids tidy closure, but complexity is more gestured than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“colors swirl and merge like constellations”). No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Free-indirect style stays clean; psychic distance modulates with memory. Occasional elevated diction (“transcends ordinary time”) risks register drift but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Few loops; “elusively tangible” repeats but serves motif. Metaphors are coherent, though “eternal instant” edges toward abstraction. No artifacts in closure beat; clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes memory, art, and liminal commerce into a fresh angle on legacy. Lighthouse lens as translator’s key is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in non-linear structure pays off. Avoids derivative tropes through specificity of grandmother’s encoded dots.</comment>
