<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority crackles—his conflicted reverence, embodied expertise, and final glimmer of reclaimed passion are coherently rooted in both the shard and the curtainside realism. Motivation cascades: grief → failure → appraisal → re-ignition, paced to tighten stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A member of the Super Lead grille cloth drives because/therefore linkage from setup to payoff: discovery → authentication → shafts of self-worth. The ending’s Earned Stasis reconfigures meaning without tidy resolution, all under sustained lyrical lens held till final image.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quarry trailer’s sensory economy is weaponised: dust on fingertips refracts memories, static A/C mirrors resignation; micro-setting supplies situation evolution with no white-room syndrome. Tool and pacing crystallise through embodied specificity.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“claiming identity after collapse”—is tightly pressured by the evolving cloth clue; the beat where he authenticates it forecloses external prestige and reopens private worth, visible cost charged to closure image.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: cloth as bridge between applause and echo, crystallised in final moment of sealing evidence—non-literal answer that reweights failure into quiet purpose, resisting moralizing.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV stays in Marcus’s embodied idiom; free indirect style clean; sentence rhythm narrows under quarry noise, no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature (antiquarian eye under grief lens) modulates with emotional pressure and lands clear cadence.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose compresses yet sings: “speaker grille cloth on his desk”→ “visible or felt cost.” Dense single-subject verbs, zero loops or template cadences; quarry grit hued metaphors restrict no clarity.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grille cloth → vintage SOUND know-how filament → Leeds residue synthesis feels non-obvious and inevitable; specific synthesis sculpts fresh angle on failure/redemption without gimmickry. Risk in compressed lyric pays mirrored payoff.</question>
