<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling hands”); her curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (overlays, frame-by-frame study). The final renunciation—repairing the map to honor the divide—earns its cost from prior discoveries. Yet the empathy motive stays more stated than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara reweights the torn map from barrier to threshold, with felt conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds (footage analysis → pattern → celestial alignment → map repair). Orientation is swift; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, signaled early by layered footage and tightening pattern density.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and torn map are tactile, selective, and thematically charged; the map’s tear literally constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s profession—shadow, vegetation, stone placement. Weather seeps into mood without cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopen the henge’s secret—tightens once via the celestial pattern discovery, foreclosing physical reopening in favor of experiential understanding. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elara forfeits the prestige of a mapped revelation for shielded openness. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as relationship, not possession. The final image of the repaired tear offers a non-literal answer—threshold honored, mystery preserved. Subtext in the Guild’s forgotten surveillance hints at institutional silence without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“persistent drumming of water on ancient stone”). Perceptual signature is map-framer specific—shadow overlays, constellation paths. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“celestial phenomenon”) fits the Guild register. No loops or scaffold. Minor density spike in the celestial exposition but momentum recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cartography, celestial alignment, and sacred silence feels fresh and inevitable. The torn-map-as-threshold reconfigures a familiar quest trope. Specificity of the Guild’s forgotten surveillance adds texture without exposition.</comment>
