<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his isolation, obsession, and variant allegiance are embodied through sensory detail and ritual action. Yet the story never dramatizes a decisive micro-choice; he only listens, translates, and watches. The final smile feels like summary rather than earned renunciation or crystallized stance, so the cost is only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: storm patterns and radio fragments layer until the final image reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias’s recognition that the prophet below now carries the charge he once held alone. The cost is conceptual (obsolescence of his role) and felt on the page in the final “smile at the fragmented radio frequencies.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is rendered with tactile specificity—floatstone, ozone, cobalt glass casting cobweb light that Elias traces. The setting constrains every move: storms gate access, the portico amplifies signals, altitude enforces isolation. Final image reuses the portico’s “humming” to charge closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias’s solitary translation matter?—tightens as a surface prophet appropriates his findings. Pressure escalates via intensifying storms and growing crowds glimpsed in the glass. Agency, however, remains observational; the decisive shift is external, so cost is more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transmission, appropriation, and the loneliness of early witness. The prophet’s rise reframes Elias’s work from heresy to precursor without moralizing. Final image of “ancient shadows” reweights the premise—knowledge outlives its translator—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, precise, and consistent: “frequencies that whispered through the void between lightning strikes.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long accumulative sentences during calm, clipped fragments during storm. No dialogue, so no risk of convergence; perceptual signature remains singular and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or idea without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“lyrically prophetic”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere. Minor ozone/”midnight oil” pairing feels familiar but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—weather as encoded ancestral archive—is fresh and pursued with conviction. Tropes of isolated visionary and rising prophet are transformed through electromagnetic specificity and the variant allegiance concept. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
