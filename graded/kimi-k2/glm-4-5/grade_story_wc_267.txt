<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied (phantom tingles, trembling hand) and the final choice is foreshadowed by the bolt’s warmth and the step’s pulse. The shift from passive acceptance to active singing is earned through tactile discovery and memory. Flaw: the “accident” revelation is told rather than dramatized, blunting causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the first sung note reconfigures the fortress and the bellhop’s stance. Causal lens holds: bolt discovery → etchings → recognition → decision → song. Cost is visible in the trembling hand and the fortress’s ancient hum. Orientation is anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is micro-anchored in the spiral step and bolt, which constrain the decisive touch and later warm under song. Snowfall and cobalt light mirror interior cold and thaw. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The fortress itself becomes a resonant instrument by the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safety vs. voice—is signaled early and tightened when the bolt reveals the price of silence. The final choice forecloses lifelong sanctuary with the first sung note. Escalation is causal: each tactile discovery narrows options until only song or eternal silence remain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between protection and expression; no moralizing. The final image—snow dancing to newfound rhythm—reweights the premise without statement. Subtext lives in the bolt’s worn smoothness and the discoloration like “dried tears.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, consistent with a once-singer who now moves in silence. Syntax lengthens during memory, shortens under decision. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is selective (choir jacket loose, phantom tingles). Register never drifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“frostbitten hope”). Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—fortress powered by sacrificed voices—feels fresh, and the bolt as key to reversal is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity (choir jacket, nerve regeneration) grounds the mythic frame. Risky inversion of sanctuary trope pays off.</comment>
