<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her scientific lens on foam and chrysalis feels character-specific—but the pivotal “I need to atone” arrives with minimal embodied cost; the phone call resolves tension too smoothly, undercutting the promised struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the braided ravine image reconfigures meaning (CR) by equating molecular and relational bonds, and the cost—admitting neglect—is on-page. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the single-scene default is met, transitions are smooth, and orientation is anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The ravine’s braided channels, foam eddies, and chrysalis are selective, sensory, and repeatedly filter through Elara’s polymer gaze; the river’s pattern literally constrains her insight and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—repairing the ruptured sister bond—is signaled by the chrysalis trigger and tightens when Elara kneels to trace foam; the phone call crystallizes her stance with visible emotional cost. Pressure escalates via pattern deepening rather than multiple reversals; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: separation-as-connection is woven through polymer chains, river braids, and chrysalis husk. The final reweighting avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “divergent paths that could still lead home.” Subtext in the sister’s soft laugh carries more than dialogue states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded in scientific diction; perceptual signature (“polymer chemistry notes forgotten”) is immediate. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays controlled. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden; rhythm modulates with emotional rise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“molecular bonds forming and breaking”). No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; final line’s cadence echoes opening river image without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of polymer science, musicality, and grief feels fresh; the chrysalis-as-transformation motif is familiar but re-cast through lab vocabulary and river topology. Risk is moderate—quiet epiphany rather than twist—but specificity prevents template feel.</comment>
