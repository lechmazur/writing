<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction (“choking beauty” repeated without fresh embodiment). The cartomancer’s shift from control to surrender is legible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than viscerally hers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked saucer reframes time as presence, not recovery. Causal chain is thin—ritual mechanics are asserted more than dramatized—but the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Midnight glade above clouds is atmospherically rich yet functions mainly as backdrop; the dolls’ tea set saucer does micro-setting duty, constraining the ritual and charging the final image, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens once via the saucer’s vision, but escalation is more textural than causal; pressure accrues through imagery rather than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of presence-over-recovery emerges organically from the saucer’s reprise; final paragraph’s moralizing (“some mysteries meant to remain unsolved”) edges toward statement, slightly blunting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrically compressed, and perceptually specific; patterned elision (“willingly perplexed”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; cadence modulates with emotional rise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“amber of time,” “choking beauty”) risk overwriting but never obscure causality. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartomancy, cloudbound ritual, and motherhood memory feels fresh; cracked saucer as kintsugi time-vessel is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode stays coherent to closure.</comment>
