<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya shows actionable interiority and contradicting impulses: military operator reflex versus open-wonder seeker; the perpetually surprised trait filters every reaction and directly costs her tactical edge when the drone falters under wonder. One missing gun-shy moment kept her from 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore linkage leading to the pull climax where missing pieces literalise the frequency of belonging. Closure lands on-page with unmistakable reverberating cost as stasis crystallizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory is used—pressure from midnight pattern recognition, drone position calibration, pulse of brilliant dimness as constraint—plus the body/tool (type matrix) doubling as micro-setting that limits choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens from find formula → establish resonance → pay emotional/temporal cost; the pull action redefines option space and extracts galactic frequency, with her stance crystallised in a charged poise holding accepted absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges through iterative micro-rejections and re-claimings; closure image reframes solitary signal as self-belonging without moralising—the bright dimness remains unsettled, cost paid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature (“brilliant dimness” used precisely), rhythmic control under pressure, and drone POV compression without head-hop. Occasional ornate clauses nudge down.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</degree><comment>No loops; almost every sentence advances propulsion, tension, or atmospheric weight. Few metaphors stray into abstract “galaxies of implication,” trimming .1 from peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic decoding wrapped in codework and military drone tech; the frequency-of-belonging concept feels inevitable and charged, not trendy, with type-matrix silicon embodying metaphysical absence.</comment>
