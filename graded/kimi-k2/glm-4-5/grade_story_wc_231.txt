<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s eccentricity is shown through concrete habits (no phone, star-talk) and his micro-choice to descend the dock, but the borrowed memories arrive as external gift rather than earned internal shift; final gesture of release is credible yet lacks visible cost on Elias.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; causal chain (stranger → Edelweiss → memories → understanding → release) lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: Elias accepts lifelong isolation now reweighted as connection. Orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Opal dock and mist are vivid, selective, and constrain action (slippery planks, obscured footprints); Edelweiss glows in final image, charging closure. Micro-setting (lighthouse lamp, brass spyglass) tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture—tightens once when Elias realizes it is an offering, not a warning; agency is renunciation of the flower with visible cost: surrendering the last relic of another life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation transmuted into communion emerges through imagery (mist, stars, Edelweiss) without moralizing; final gesture reweights prior solitude as shared human witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature (brass spectacles, star-talk) is distinct. Prose texture is lyrical yet precise, matching twilight liminality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm; figurative language (“moon-bleached bone”) is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Minor filter verbs (“seemed to dissolve”) forgiven under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar ghost-memory trope is refreshed by alpine Edelweiss at sea and nautical twilight ritual; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
