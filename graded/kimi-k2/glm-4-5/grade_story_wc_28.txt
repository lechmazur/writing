<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s “gentle radical” nature is embodied in the tactile act of placing the tessera and the whispered renaming; the interior contradiction between steel and empathy is shown, not stated. The retrocognitive visions are anchored in present gesture (hand on mosaic), so memory alters tactics rather than summarizing. Motivation stays consistent and intensifies to the final choice, but the cost—his perpetual haunting—is only implied, not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plaza is renamed and reclaimed, the survivors’ stance visibly shifts, and the cost is the irreversible past Elias must keep reliving. Causality is accumulative/textural: each tessera touch layers memory until the mosaic’s pattern reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One minor drift: “Samarkhand” appears only once, so the renaming punch could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky and ash-dusted plaza are filtered through Elias’s selective attention; every sensory note (wind through archways, warmth of tessera) constrains his ritual movement. The mosaic stepping stone functions as micro-setting that literally guides his fingers and choices. One missed beat: plaza’s spatial relation to the minaret remains vague, slightly blurring the tessera’s origin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—restore memory and communal identity—tightens when Elias decides to rename the plaza aloud. Escalation is textural: each recovered memory increases emotional density until the final utterance reweights collective grief. Cost is felt in the survivors’ hush and Elias’s retrocognitive burden, though not explicitly paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through the act of renaming ruins instead of abandoning them; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in the tessera’s “insistence on being seen” and the sky transformed into “cathedral ceiling.” Final image reconfigures loss as potential without sermonizing. One soft echo: “We are what rises from the ashes” edges toward summary, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elias’s tactile perception; rhythm swells and contracts with memory flashes. No head-hopping; POV stays interior and consistent. Distinctive diction—“retrocognitively trapped,” “aberrant mercy”—feels earned by worldview. Only minor cadence hiccup: two successive sentences begin with “As Elias…” creating a faint template echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful; each sentence advances memory, setting, or ritual. Figurative language is selective (“cathedral ceiling open to stars”) and avoids purple drift. One paraphrase loop: “shattered sky above mirrored the fragments of civilization” and “fractured heavens above mirrored the fragments” within four lines. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Post-apocalyptic rebuilding is familiar, yet the retrocognitive caretaker who restores place-names through mosaic touch feels specific and fresh. The tessera’s journey from lost fragment to keystone of ritual is a non-obvious reconfiguration. Risk is moderate: lyric mode could have slipped into sentimentality but stays restrained. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
