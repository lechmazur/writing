<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Contradictory stoic/sensitive trait is shown through his careful, almost reverent handling of the memory-cubes, but interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; final renunciation (“tomorrow he would listen again”) is credible but cost is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: discovery → retrieval → inscription → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (he recommits to the work), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; transitions are legible, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Submerged pavilion is tactile, water temperature and marble texture felt through action; antique inkwell’s bronze reflection threads into sunset image, charging final beat. Spatial choreography clean; environment constrains access and shapes solitary ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering and preserving lost memories—intensifies when the metal box resists extraction, but escalation plateaus after retrieval; no further narrowing of options or new cost beyond “heavier inkwell.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of excavating abandoned dreams emerges through concrete acts (drawing submerged walkways, sealing notes) rather than statement; final note’s question reframes earlier images without moralizing. Subtext of stewardship vs. voyeurism lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with precise, slightly archaic diction (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) that suits the surveyor’s mindset. Sensory filtering is character-bound; no head-hopping. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional lyrical surplus (“hushed blaze of oranges and purples”) edges toward overwriting but does not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar motif of submerged ruin is refreshed by treating it as archive rather than tragedy; the surveyor’s practice of embedding emotional notes in repairs offers a non-obvious ritual. Specificity of bronze inkwell and preservation cubes anchors originality.</comment>
