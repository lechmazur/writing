<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elthion’s interiority is textured and embodied, but his decisive moment—“I will capture what we have been”—arrives more as declaration than dramatized choice; the preemptive nostalgia trait is shown early yet never visibly constrains or alters his tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures the stake from “preserve memory” to “sculpt identity,” with felt cost in the deepening hush; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the causal linkage between shadow-length conjecture and this crystallized stance is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog are vivid and selective; the crystals’ whispering property directly charges the final image by amplifying Elthion’s vow, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving collective identity—is clear; pressure deepens through accumulating sensory density rather than causal reversals, culminating in a visible cost (the archivist stays below, alone). One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as living architecture emerges organically from setting and action; the ending’s non-literal reweighting avoids moralizing, though a touch of overt statement (“so that we might know what we can become”) nudges it below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a consistent perceptual signature; syntactic rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; occasional echoing stems (“memories dripping,” “preemptively nostalgic heart”) are minor loops that do not obscure clarity or stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The conceit of fog solidifying into architecture while memories are harvested by summer quills feels fresh and fully committed; risk-taking in lyric mode heightens resonance without gimmickry.</comment>
