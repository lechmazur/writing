<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The “otherworldly sentimentalist” is more archetype than individual; interiority remains abstract (“its form shifting like stardust”) and choices are reported rather than dramatized. Motivation (“share light without using fire”) is stated early and reiterated, but no contradictory impulse or embodied cost complicates it. The gear’s history is evocative yet external; the being’s final decision to depart feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the civilization receives light without fire, reconfiguring the sentimentalist’s eternal pattern. Causality is accumulative/textural—each sonar ping and gear rotation layers density until the final illumination. Orientation is clear by line 3; the nebula garden and transit mechanics are legible. Cost is conceptual (another cycle of hope) rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden’s shifting colors and falling petals are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; they mirror the “troubling serenity” tone and guide the sentimentalist’s transit path. Spatial choreography holds across dimensions; the gear’s glow and petal drift anchor sensory continuity. Micro-setting (the gear as handled object) constrains the final choice by recording outcomes. One slip: “troubling serenity” is named rather than rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether this civilization will accept non-consuming light—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page opposition or resource loss sharpens it. Escalation is textural: sonar pings intensify, gear accelerates, petals deepen in hue. Agency is diffuse; the sentimentalist acts as cosmic functionary rather than pressured individual. Closure reweights the pattern yet lacks a tangible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of illumination without destruction emerges organically through the gear’s history and the civilization’s reception; no overt moralizing. Subtext resides in the gear’s endless approximation of infinity—knowledge persists yet never completes. Final image of “hope that this time…patterns might break” offers resonant ambiguity. One soft echo: “share light without using fire” is repeated without new inflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-cosmic, consistent in diction and cadence; “quiet sigh of falling petals” becomes a refrain that modulates tone. Compression and patterned repetition (“across the quiet sigh…”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue; interiority remains omniscient yet coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual cost”) slightly drifts from the POV’s experiential lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; metaphor chains stay coherent within cosmic logic. Rhythm alternates between long breaths and tight pulses, matching transit tension. One loop: “approximating infinity” appears three times without deepening nuance. No scaffold or redundancy in peak beats; final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic caretaker, generational data-gear, and gentle illumination avoids genre clichés. The premise commits fully; no late rule changes. Specificity lies in the gear’s etched histories and petal-tears rather than broad archetype. Risk is moderate—lyric cosmicism is familiar—but execution is confident.</comment>
