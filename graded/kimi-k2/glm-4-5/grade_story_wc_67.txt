<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete ("face etched with sorrow and determination") and her micro-choice to place the mask after the rocking chair stops crystallizes forty years of quiet endurance. The contradiction between her life's work—capturing ephemera in porcelain—and her admission that completion itself is impossible costs her the illusion of safety, felt on the page in the slowing arcs of the final rock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: the cessation of the rocking chair triggers a charged poise that reconfigures meaning without needing a causal chain. The cost is visible—"no safety to be found in completion, only in the continuous process"—foreclosing the lifelong quest the gallery enabled. Orientation is clear within the first 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-point gallery and the rocking chair anchor all movement, literally shaping Elena's trajectory from creak to silence. The micro-setting of the porcelain shards under powder light creates spatial intimacy that finalizes the image. Only the gallery itself does not coerce a concrete choice, preventing the higher band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the hope that art could confer safety—is steadily tightened by every shard and ash drift until it collapses when the chair stops. The tightening is earned by earlier images: disintegrating portraits and porcelain cracks foreshadow the conclusion that meaning resists containment. Cost is tangible in the renunciation of that hope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>"Mirage of safety" binds every artistic practice, but the theme crystallizes cleanly without any preachy restatement. Its resonance emerges from the concrete scene—the slowing rocker, the powdering hands—more than from imposed interpretation, landing just short of a repricing in the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, elegiac, sentence rhythm echoing the diminishing glide of the rocking chair. Compression (“porous grief,” “ash scatterer”) is taught early and repaid in closure. No head-hopping; focalization remains intimate to Elena's strained perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet sensory: “powdered the surface...watching as the fine dust settled into the cracks.” Filter verbs are sparse, sentences vary dynamically, and metaphor does not strain physics. One or two near-duplicate phrases (“incomplete information,” “truth carefully”) nudge it from perfection.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The combination of ash-scattering portraiture, porcelain reassembly, and the gallery’s infinite receding perspectives feels singular. The speculative-professional frame is fresh, the emotional insight precise. Derivative echoes are avoided; only a hairline slip in familiar grief motifs keeps it below 8.8 band.</comment>
