<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“featherly determination,” tracing wood grain), but the late appearance of her father dilutes the crucible effect; the final reunion feels slightly gift-wrapped rather than earned through visible cost on her side.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of thresholds intensifies until the oak doorway crystallizes the stakes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—“Home” reweights the logbook and the maze—though the father’s sudden arrival softens the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and dissolving wood anchors are sensuous and selective; the oak doorway’s grain pattern directly constrains Elara’s final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal shifts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—tightens through each crossing; the oak doorway forces a decisive step with felt resonance. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than external antagonist, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds as portals of self-transformation emerges organically from Elara’s tactile journey; the final image of father and daughter crossing together offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“fractured hush,” “prismatic light”—sustains a consistent perceptual signature. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language rarely overruns clarity. One minor loop—“necessary distances” repeated without new inflection—keeps it from 9.0, but no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze logic and liminal cosmology; the pilot logbook as threshold map feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
