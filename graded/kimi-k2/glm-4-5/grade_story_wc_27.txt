<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; the barefoot stargazer’s contradictory impulses (“uncertainty” vs “determination”) are stated rather than dramatized. Her final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels abstract. Motivation (“seeking something she couldn’t name”) remains vague until the last paragraph, weakening causal linkage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ruin → stone circle → luminous transformation. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cosmic cost. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Minor drift: the stone circle’s sudden appearance bends causality without prior cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dusty repair bay, fractured ceiling, dormant drones—details are selective and textured. The opera glasses and bare feet act as micro-settings that ground POV. Environment subtly guides her path and final stance. One spatial hiccup: “crippled freighter” to stone circle transition skips layout logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: personal meaning amid societal collapse. Pressure tightens when the stones’ hum demands surrender; her choice to “reignite” crystallizes stance with cosmic cost. Escalation is tonal rather than causal; no concrete price beyond spiritual awe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through ruin emerges via image pattern (broken tech → living stone). Subtext is carried by light and hum rather than statement. Final image reweights the rebellion’s pause as cosmic invitation, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in barefoot kinesthetics and star-fixed attention. Syntax modulates with scene intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“technological ambition”) slightly drifts from POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language is purposeful. One loop: “broken ships and broken dreams” cliché. Otherwise clean. Final paragraph’s cadence earns resonance without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Stone circle amid spaceport ruin is fresh synthesis of sci-fi and myth. Tropes are transformed through tactile specificity. Risky cosmic closure pays off, though premise edges familiar “chosen one” territory.</comment>
