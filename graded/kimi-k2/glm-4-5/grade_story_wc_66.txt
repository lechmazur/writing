<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is thin—motivation stated as “simple yet profound” rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses in-scene; choices feel pre-ordained. Micro-choice (tuning the dial) is present but low-stakes. Cost is gestured at (“dangerous”) yet never dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of dust “whispering” reconfigures meaning, but causality is loose—how dust retains and transmits is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One transition (apartment → alcove) handled cleanly. Persistent constraint (risk of capture) is named but not leveraged in tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Ember alcove and mist create tactile pressure; the radio dial’s glow serves as micro-setting anchor. Details are selective and filtered through POV. Environment guides choice—hidden hillside enables broadcast—but final image doesn’t hinge on setting itself. Sensory balance favors visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keeping stories alive under censorship—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when she embeds forbidden tales in lyrics, but the beat is summary, not dramatized. Agency is high-level (“she began her broadcast”) without moment-to-moment risk. Cost is abstract; no visible forfeiture on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of narrative freedom vs. control emerges through action rather than lecture. Subtext in lyrics-as-code is effective. Final image of dust as living archive offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, but thematic complexity stays moderate—no competing goods explored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, with controlled rhythm. Perceptual signature (“thistled calm”) is distinctive. No dialogue, so no register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts out of POV lexicon but recovers quickly. Compression is purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, mostly free of loops; one paraphrase loop (“dust would carry…dust would continue”) noted. Metaphors coherent. Strong open and close lines. Minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to”) but not in peak beats. Density high; no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—dust as undetectable story medium—is fresh and specific. Combines mundane tech (radio) with low-fantasy element organically. Avoids genre clichés; “Dust Singer” mythos feels earned. Risk is moderate; could push further into moral ambiguity or technical plausibility.</comment>
