<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her guilt over her sister threads every micro-choice, and the tactile handling of the emerald chip shows embodied emotion. The single on-page character passes the crucible test: her final placement of the vial crystallizes a renunciation (she cannot save, only preserve) with visible cost. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, however, so the 9+ quick test just misses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial joins the shelf, reconfiguring Elara’s endless vigil without solving her grief. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each memory strand tightens the pattern until the final hush. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no lens ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto’s crystalline walls refract aurora onto the emerald chip, literally guiding Elara’s hand placement and charging the final image. Micro-setting (the table, the shelf) constrains movement and object handling. Selective sensory detail (scent of apples, warmth of stone) is filtered through her professional priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightened as the static resolves into coherent memory. Agency is renunciation: she completes the capture yet must relinquish the living body. Cost is felt in the vial’s weight on the shelf, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and loss; the final image of glowing vials offers a non-literal answer to what survives us. Subtext lives in gesture—the gentle closing of the woman’s eyes says more than any statement about mortality. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited is stable; perceptual signature is precise—aurora light on facets, orchard scent, cellular glow. Syntax modulates with ritual cadence, then compresses at the climax. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors (radio dial, loom threads) are purposeful and paid off. Zero loops or scaffold; high information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The beautician-mortician fusion feels fresh; the emerald chip as soul-capture device is specific and irreplicable. Aurora-lit grotto reframes familiar afterlife imagery into a skyborne laboratory. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final hush.</comment>
