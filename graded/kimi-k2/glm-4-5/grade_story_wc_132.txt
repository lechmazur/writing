<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s arc—scientist shackled by control to partner who listens—lands and carries cost, yet her contradictory interior pulses are sometimes paraphrase-looped (“reluctant metamorphosis... sustaining transformation”). Micro-choice to open vents is earned; earlier refusal beats feel slightly summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive renunciation with visible cost on page: “trembling hands... reconstruct her methods... releasing control.” Drive lens hybrid-situational holds cleanly; the final image (lindens doubled) crystallizes gained stance. Penalty −0.3 for minor causal softens in middle beats, but ending is intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mossy trellis returns charged at closure, constraining the choice point. Moist soil, dripping wood, vent openings anchor place and evolve with plot. Sensory selection mirrors Elara’s shifting attention (documenting → observing) without symbolic overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—mastery versus partnership—signaled early, tightens at every storm, climaxes in single decision. Pressure legible; storms complicate rather than resolve. Cost comes at moment she dismantles her own shields, but earlier stakes lean slightly explanatory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (“control limits growth”) emerges via action and final image. Resists tidy moral, lands through particular plant behavior. One phrase drifts into meta-echo (“sustaining transformation”) applying −0.2; otherwise coherence is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative texture is consistent and vivid, with precise horticultural lexicon anchoring POV. Free indirect style is clean; Marco’s line carries subtext. Occasional elevated clause (“motivation had shifted...”) registers −0.3 for register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes and propels on small scale; a few near-reiterated phrases (“reluctant metamorphosis” echo) are minor clutter not touching finale. Density high; figurative language purposeful. One mixed metaphor (“seed of doubt that grew”) slightly fuzzes image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Control vs collaboration through botanic lens feels fresh; transformation trope earned via incremental stakes rather than late gimmick. Risk level moderate; specificity to Elara’s world and stakes creates individuality. Not transformative at global 9+ tier but distinctive.</comment>
