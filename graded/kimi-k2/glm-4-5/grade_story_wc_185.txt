<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mapkeeper’s motivation—“to find the quiet in the storm”—is stated early and aligns with inherited duty, but interiority stays on the declarative level. No contradictory impulse surfaces in-scene; choices feel predetermined. The earned change is foreshadowed more than lived, so cost registers as symbolic rather than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV, two discrete shards (disturbed caves → Ice Sanctum → re-center) with one legible transition. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the bloom of hush locks in the new harmonic frequency, the stone forever altered. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the orientation test finesse required by the Ice Sanctum is light-resolution, not decisive crux, so cost remains glance-level not bone-deep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Caves throb with sonic texture, ice walls preserve mute histories, and echo-stone glows through touch; each constraint is visited on the page. Cave resonance literally shapes tactics (“counter-frequency”). Micro-setting of stone-in-palm closes the new chord; ice-etymology frames stakes. Sensory hierarchy favors haptic and aural over visual, staying true to a profession that “reads by touch.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Central stake—save ancient ripple-marks from erasure— is clear and urgent. Conflict escalates via absorption of chaos into complement rhythm; agency is choice to harmonize, not defeat. One explicit turn (bloom of hush) suffices, but cost manifests as immutable transformation of artifact and duty rather than forfeited opportunity; felt price stays implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme surfaces via pattern maintenance vs. evolution: “evolution too had its place in the harmonic caves.” Silence reconfigured from absence to lived balance lands without sermonizing. Subtext echoes through “hammered repose” and restored yet revoiced ripple-marks: stasis bought by perpetual recalibration. Final image reframes rather than declares, satisfying complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Liquid, weighted diction (“ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “bloom of hush”) remains consistent; no filter-verb leakage. Compression yields rhythmic breathing clusters rather than staccato bursts, mirroring cave acoustics. POV static but tightly aligned to sensorial perception. Dialogue absent, so voice evaluated solely on narrative texture and internal lens, which never over-reaches knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished: economical noun-verb chains, lyrical without purple drift. Minor loops—“gentle luminosity,” “glowed brighter” within three sentences—cause localized hiccup, not reflexive pattern. Micro-metaphor architecture (ice=sheet music) sustainable. One homophone faint echo (“thrummed with … disturbances”) tolerated under poetic license. Final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Harmonic cave” + “energy beings” + “ice-cracked musical notation” creates specific-frequency world logic. Subverts expected “battle against intruders” by shifting to integration rather than expulsion. Risk carried: reader required to buy sonic archaeology as intuitive science; reward is fresh resonance between climate record and subjective equilibrium. Premise feels inevitable once established.</comment>
