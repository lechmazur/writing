<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias’s serenity is stated repeatedly but never tested; no embodied contradiction or visible cost appears. The mentor conflict is off-stage, so interior stakes remain abstract. Micro-choices (packing puppets, calligraphy) are ritual, not crucible. Closure is a quiet nod rather than earned stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—Elias smiles at “next project”—but the cost is only implied. Causal chain is loose: argument → puppet show → reflection, with no tightening beat. Orientation is clear; transitions are smooth. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The radar dome’s concrete hush and indigo twilight texture the mood, but it never constrains a choice. Bar staging is vivid yet generic. Campfire stick is handled twice, gaining new stories, yet its weight is more symbol than lever. Micro-setting (worktable, stage corner) is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. harmful narratives—is declared early but never sharpened onstage. No reversal or tightening occurs; the homeless stories persuade without resistance. Audience softening is reported, not dramatized. Cost is absent; tactics unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of narrative ethics emerges through performance rather than lecture. Final image of glowing stick reweights earlier heirloom motif. Subtext in audience silence is effective. Yet the piece edges toward thematic echo (“ethical storytelling required…”) that blunts resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is urbane, lyrical, consistent; perceptual signature favors ink, parchment, meteor hush. Compression and patterned repetition (“half-lit epiphany”) teach the cadence early. No dialogue to test naturalism. Free-indirect texture is clean; psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and selective sensory detail. Occasional stacked modifiers (“massive concrete structure, once tracking distant threats”) verge on overwriting but stay legible. No loops or scaffold. Filter verbs minimal. Final line lands quietly without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Subversive puppet shows in decommissioned radar dome is a fresh synthesis; trope of activist artist gains specificity through calligraphy and heirloom stick. Risk is moderate but coherent. No close echoes. Conceptual integrity intact; premise followed through.</comment>
