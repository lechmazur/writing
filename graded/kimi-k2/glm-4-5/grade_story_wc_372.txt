<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s gently meticulous trait is embodied in the careful handling of the lantern slide and the ledger, but interior contradiction is muted; the final smile feels more authorial than earned. Motivation is clear—preserve the vows—but the cost of that preservation is only gestured at, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s discovery that some vows can still be reinforced crystallizes his stance and reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hope increases through pattern of fading/renewal—yet the felt cost is soft, more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen library is vivid and selective—“quartz hush,” “ice-encrusted windows”—and the lantern slide functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean; the sampler’s brass-and-crystal presence anchors the scene without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the vows—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes reinforcement is possible. The pressure deepens through pattern of diminishing light, but the cost of the new work is stated rather than shown, muting escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus oblivion emerges organically from the fading vows and Elias’s meticulous labor. Final image of the slide held aloft reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-bound—“quartz hush,” “crystalline prison”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous vows,” “edge of oblivion”) fits the elevated register, but a few near-redundant phrases (“gentle meticulous nature made him uniquely suited”) slightly dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of crystallized promises in a skyborne library is fresh, and the lantern-slide sampler feels specific rather than generic. Risk is moderate; the piece commits fully to its lyric mode without gimmickry.</comment>
