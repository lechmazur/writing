<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative (“reed-blown melancholy”) and motives shift credibly from abstract curiosity to compassionate intervention, but the child-spirit remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent and the final change feels more bestowed than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of disclosure beats tighten toward the luminous release. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—balance restored via song—yet the cost (loss of the singer’s lifelong melancholy) is stated more than dramatized on the body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Serpentine nexus under starlight” and the whispering seashell half function as micro-setting that constrains tactics: the shell’s glow cues the final choice. Sensory selection is biased to the singer’s perception, though some phrasing drifts toward the generic (“webs of intrigue”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—maintaining echo/silence balance—is signaled early and escalates through the child-spirit’s growing echo. One meaningful tightening occurs when the singer pivots from study to soothing. Cost is legible but soft: the seashell falls silent, melancholy lifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of letting go emerges organically from the child’s refusal to fade and the singer’s reluctant mercy. Final image of “light that was neither star nor sun” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the shell’s whispers and the singer’s song carries the emotional freight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific—“star patterns above shifted to reveal hidden paths.” Patterned repetition (“while the universe hummed…”) is taught early and pays off in closure cadence. No dialogue, so voice convergence is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked modifiers (“reed-blown melancholy of her existence colored every thought”) flirt with overwriting but stay within voice. No loops or scaffold detected. Rhythm modulates with emotional peaks, though a few sentences could lose a clause for propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar trope of the wandering spirit-guide is refreshed by the seashell oracle and the child-echo anomaly. Specificity of “canyon echo singer” and the nexus geometry grounds the mythic frame. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode; it succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
