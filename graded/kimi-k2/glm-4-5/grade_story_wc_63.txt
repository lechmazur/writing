<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s ethical diligence and guilt are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the rake handle, kneeling at the tower base). The shift from solitary precision to communal vulnerability is earned through visible cost—his public admission of need. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The final renunciation of lone control lands with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under causal lens: stalled pendulum → rake inscription → summons townsfolk → collective repair. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared stewardship crystallizes in the first bell. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in Alaric’s cracked voice and relinquished sole authority.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower interior are filtered through Alaric’s precision mindset; details constrain choices (heat bleeding through the rake handle, sun at zenith dictating timing). Micro-setting of the rake handle functions as charged object. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment subtly mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of communal balance—tightens when Alaric realizes he cannot act alone. One meaningful escalation: solitary repair attempt → public call for help. Cost is visible in social exposure and relinquished control. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency remains with protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared responsibility emerges through action and image, not statement. The rake handle’s inscriptions reweight from cryptic guilt to communal covenant. Final bell resonates as non-literal answer: time kept by many hands. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “imperfect harmony.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Alaric’s precision-obsessed perception. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly elevated to match his meticulous nature without drifting into purple. No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural when it appears (“I need helpers!” carries subtext of shame and hope).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“heat bled through fingertips”) and never muddles causality. Sentence rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and re-charge motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar premise (atonement through communal repair) is refreshed via clockwork specificity and the rake-handle oracle. The transformation from lone winder to community steward feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specific occupational detail (pendulum length adjustment) grounds the arc. No derivative echoes.</comment>
