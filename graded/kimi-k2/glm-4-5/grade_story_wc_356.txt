<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s olfactorily-driven interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from ambition to stewardship is legible. Yet the “serenity within motion” motive is asserted more than dramatized, and the final beat of welcoming villagers feels slightly performative rather than earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the seed’s revelation reconfigures Elara’s purpose and the village’s future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned scent-doodles accumulate until the final image reweights them. Cost is felt in the shift from private obsession to communal responsibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The treetop village is evoked through rope bridges, mists, and platform choreography that constrain movement. The corpse-flower’s blue filaments become a micro-setting that charges the final image. A few phrases (“wildflower hush of dawn”) risk prettiness but stay within POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlock the seed’s secret—tightens once when the moonlit opening forces Elara to revise her entire aim. The cost is the surrender of sole ownership of knowledge. Pressure is coherent but single-turn; no secondary reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-guardianship emerges organically from scent, doodles, and lineage. The final image of twinkling village lights reframes earlier ambition into stewardship without moralizing. Subtext in the elders’ “quiet approval” is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s olfactory perception; diction is lyrical yet precise. Rhythm modulates with ascent and vigil. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; sensory specificity outweighs occasional soft-focus phrases. No loops or scaffold. A few stacked modifiers (“wildflower hush of existence itself”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The corpse-flower-as-living-library twist feels inevitable in hindsight, seeded by scent and doodle motifs. Treetop herbalist culture is particularized rather than generic. Risk lies in lyric density, but it pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
