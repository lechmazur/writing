<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elien’s paradoxical aging and deliberate withholding create a credible mentor whose withheld truth costs Maya—and himself—a decade of life. Maya’s micro-choice to demand “Show me” crystallizes her shift from passive pupil to active seeker. Interiority is spare but embodied in the tightening skin and trembling platform. The relationship’s power inversion lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s vanishing reconfigures identity layers while Elien pays a visible decade. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple image deepens pattern until the final starlit grotto reweights the rule-set. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The floating rock, magnetic grotto, and sycamore canopy are selective, tactile, and constrain the lesson’s stakes. The grotto’s delayed visibility charges the final image; the platform’s tremor under Maya’s shift embodies cost. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and starlight over catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“to teach vanishing to appear”—is signaled early and tightens once when Maya demands revelation. The deepening trance and glowing grotto escalate pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Elien’s decade returned, Maya’s form fading. No coincidence resolves; agency remains with mentor and student.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of identity-shedding emerges through concrete particulars—stone, rings, grotto—never abstract assertion. The final image of Maya’s intensifying absence offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in Elien’s withheld truth creates dramatic irony. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent with Elien’s paradoxical age and meditative vocation. Syntax modulates with trance depth; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but goal-driven (“Show me”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through sycamore hush and magnetic pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“sycamore hush,” “tightening skin”). Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor filter verbs (“he thought”) are voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The backwards-aging mentor teaching disappearance-as-manifestation offers a fresh synthesis of time-paradox and spiritual instruction. Tropes are grounded in sensory specificity; no stock fantasy shorthand. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking is coherent and heightens stakes.</comment>
