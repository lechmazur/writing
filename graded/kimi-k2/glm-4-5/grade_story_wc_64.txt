<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle obsession with the tapestry is embodied in tactile micro-choices (“tender fingers,” “soft smile”), but the sacrificial revelation lands more as thematic epiphany than as a decision that costs him anything visible on the page; interior contradiction is present yet not fully dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sacrificial love reweights Elias’s understanding, and the velvet gloom becomes protective. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each decoded thread thickens the pattern until the final hum—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in his immediate life.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo’s star-drinking walls and velveteen gloom are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elias’s absorption; the setting constrains sound and light, shaping his ritual focus, though it never directly threatens or limits his choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the buried intention—escalates as each thread decoded narrows the mystery toward the sacrificial truth; pressure is intellectual and emotional rather than external, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of love’s persistence beyond death emerges organically from the tapestry’s revelation; the sacrificial twist complicates the romantic assumption without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature favors hush and starlight, with rhythmic control that modulates under the hum of the case. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, textured, and propulsive; occasional poetic layering (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo under stars”) enriches without clutter. No loops or scaffold detected; minor elevated diction fits the reverent mood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar necromantic-archive premise is refreshed by the gardener’s blithe tenderness and the sacrificial inversion; the cobalt silo and sovereign case feel specific to Elias rather than generic props.</comment>
