<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elmsley’s obsession is vivid, but interiority drifts into summary (“he knew was scientific”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile feels earned, yet the cost of his discovery remains more intellectual than visceral. Micro-choices (adjusting the phrasebook, tracing condensation) anchor character, but stakes never truly threaten his identity or safety.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the inverted delta on the window reweights the premise with quiet cost—his proof will be doubted. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of condensation and falcon returns tighten toward the final image. One transition (outpost → journey → outpost) is cleanly handled. Causality holds, though the sacred site’s confirmation is slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Outpost’s rusted metal, frozen lake, and auroras are filtered through Elmsley’s cartographer gaze; each detail later mirrors the delta pattern. The phrasebook and condensation droplets act as micro-settings that constrain reading and interpretation. Spatial choreography is coherent; cold contracts metal, breath fogs glass—tactile and specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the mythical source—intensifies through each leg of the journey. The falcon’s return and the dream condensation tighten the path, foreclosing retreat. Cost is intellectual and reputational rather than physical, but still legible. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the human need to seek origins versus the silence of the world. Condensation as inverted delta reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Indigenous wisdom and scientific method interweave without false equivalence. Final image of the single source reframes prior material with quiet awe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is crisp, slightly sardonic, consistent with a dry-witted editor. Syntax tightens under pressure (“Rivers don’t begin with springs… They begin with intention”). No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Elmsley. Diction remains within plausible lexicon; condensation motif is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Occasional lyrical lift (“auroras danced across the frozen lake”) is earned. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Minor register drift—“herald of discovery” edges toward cliché—does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mythic hydrology and modern cartography feels fresh. Condensation as oracle and falcon as guide transform familiar quest tropes. Specificity of indigenous phrasebook and inverted delta motif anchors universals. Risk in blending science and folklore pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
