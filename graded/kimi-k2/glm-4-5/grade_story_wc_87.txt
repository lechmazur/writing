<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is specific and consistent—“merrily melancholic” is felt in action—but her final epiphany about “flickering faith” arrives more through summary than embodied contradiction, keeping the change just shy of fully earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: regret-dense images build toward a crystallizing final scene where the compass turns from albatross to talisman; closure is Charged Poise with legible cost (abandoned stardom, acceptance of utility-pole navigation). One minor ellipsis: her father’s maxim enters retrospectively without earlier cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Salt air, mist, and decayed kayak launch ground readers early and reprise in the final image. The compass as micro-setting tool physically anchors Elena's hip pulse and later lightens—a vivid constraint that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens via the withdrawn job offer beat. Causality is textured, not plotted: every image accretes pressure until the dolphins catalyze release and utility-pole navigation becomes a lived narrowing. Felt cost is the abandonment of cosmic charts for terrestrial markers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “learning to read new signals after catastrophic error” emerges organically from particular actions; no overt moralizing. The final image of a “student of the sea” reframes regret as curriculum rather than curse, resonant and unsentimental. Minor drift: abstract “realignment of heart and action” verges on label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured—salt-crisp diction, rhythmic tide-like cadences, and perceptual signature that notices “brass pulse” and “laugh that escaped”. Interior free-indirect texture stays coherent; elision of technical navigation minutiae is purposeful and never confuses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly fleet and specific, marred only by two mild filter-verb patches (“she felt the heavy cloak…”) and a near-cliché “houses of cards”. No major loop dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Utility-pole astrolabe is a fresh conceit, transforming urban detritus into celestial proxies. The emotional core—navigating guilt rather than oceans—is familiar, but the concrete idiosyncrasies of brass compass + utility poles create a memorable synthesis.</comment>
