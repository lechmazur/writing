<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs exile—surface in the reversible exile demonstration; Prisha’s refusal to walk backwards crystallizes the lesson with visible cost. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, backward pacing) and character-specific. The final smile shows earned change: exile now has purpose through the student’s resilience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archivist’s exile is reweighted from curse to purpose when Prisha stands her ground. Causal chain—demonstration → Prisha’s absorption → her stance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the archivist’s genuine smile and the phrase “even if the Historians never welcome him back.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Forgotten library’s dust, narrow aisles, and drifting swing-shadow constrain movement and mood; the shard-mirror itself becomes micro-setting that literally shapes the reversible exile. Shadow detaching from the wall intersects tea leaves to reveal palace intrigue, charging the final image of lengthening shadows.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transmitting resilience under exile’s stigma. Tightening occurs when Prisha’s refusal to retreat proves the lesson; cost is the archivist’s permanent outsider status. Pressure escalates through the shard demonstration and her steady annotation, foreclosing return to the Royal Archives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-as-shadow emerges from particulars: the shadow detaches yet endures, mirroring exile’s preservation of what it removes. No moralizing; final image of lengthening shadows offers non-literal answer. Subtext in the mentor’s combative tenderness and Prisha’s silent stand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “peripheral vision like no other,” dust-laden silence, backward pacing. Voice modulates from authoritative uncertainty to genuine warmth. Dialogue sparse but subtext-rich: “Not enter exactly” carries layers of denial and invitation. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “afternoon shadow caught in glass” compresses time and image. Rhythm varies—long reflective sentences broken by crisp dialogue. No loops or scaffold; every detail advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language disciplined; mixed metaphors avoided.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as literal craft technique feels fresh; shard-mirrors plus tea-leaf geometry create non-obvious synthesis. Risky compression of memory-work into tactile ritual pays off. Specificity of “Case of Slumbering Histories” and “Wall of Whispering Shadows” anchors universals.</comment>
