<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives every beat; the ink pot’s reprise at the end crystallizes her earned stance. Micro-choices (duplicating the key, steadying her hand with the pot) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Cost is felt: she forfeits job security and employer trust. Only slight reserve: the “mathematics of fair trade” is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (observe → duplicate → breach → stamp) tightens options until the final reconfiguration—using forgery tools for truth. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the heavy seal’s weight and the reflection in the pot. No orientation drift; time and space remain coherent. Minor ellipsis in how she memorized the safe combo is allowable under motivated compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prep room’s stainless tables, chemical scent, and refrigeration hum are filtered through Maya’s professional eye and constrain tactics (camera blind spots, key duplication). The ink pot doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—her security vs. Thorne’s life—signaled early and tightened once: the moment she stamps the seal, the trade becomes irreversible. Escalation is causal and single-cycle; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: loss of job and possible charges. Coincidence is absent; every beat is earned by her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the redemption of deceptive craft in service of justice. Subtext resides in the ink pot’s shifting reflections and the “deathly vitality” of the prep room. Final image—pot reflecting “possibility of redemption”—reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity is preserved; no tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, tactile, and profession-specific: “chemical scent of preservation fluids,” “steady hands guided by years of practice.” No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Rhythm modulates with tension—longer reflective sentences in calm beats, clipped clauses during breach. Dialogue absent, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances goal or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sensory nouns and strong verbs (“liquefying rigid thinking,” “deathly vitality”) carry double duty. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to steady her thoughts”) is acceptable under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—child of criminal uses inherited skills for good—is transformed through the specific funeral-home micro-setting and the ink pot’s magical-realist property. Synthesis feels inevitable: forgery tools repurposed for asylum documents. Risk-taking in the quiet, non-violent breach pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
