<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; his “static electricity” gift is concrete. Motivation (fuse insight with empathy) is stated early and revisited, but the client remains a cipher, so relationship pressure is absent. The final smile shows earned stasis with cost—he locks away potent petals, acknowledging ethical limits. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; the arc is more observation than struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: setup (prepare), complication (integrate counterfeit nostalgia), climax (subsume original state), closure (client departs changed, Elias locks cabinet). Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—cost is the perpetual ethical burden. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. Minor slack: client’s change is reported more than witnessed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber grotto’s light and static-charged air are woven into every beat; the blotter petals act as micro-setting objects that constrain choices. Final image of locked cabinet reweights the space as both sanctuary and prison. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. No spatial contradictions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: deliver authentic-seeming nostalgia without destroying client’s agency. Pressure tightens when Elias must “subsume the last remnants” of her original state—one decisive turn. Cost is ethical: he becomes complicit in emotional forgery. Escalation is steady under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “half truths” emerges through craft: counterfeit feelings built on real substrates. Subtext surfaces in Elias’s nightly ritual of locking away potency—he half-believes his own lie. No explicit moralizing; resonance lingers in the locked cabinet image. Complexity is honored; no tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is precise (“fingers tingling with static electricity”). Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, and free of head-hopping. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent. Register never drifts into exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“crystallized final moment”) is earned by tone. Metaphors are coherent. One minor paraphrase loop near end (“genuine fulfillment…unusual path”) but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Counterfeit emotion dealer is a fresh angle; the blotter-petal tech and static-sensing method are specific inventions. Premise is fully inhabited, not gimmicky. Risk: ethical complicity of the healer-artisan. No derivative echoes; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
