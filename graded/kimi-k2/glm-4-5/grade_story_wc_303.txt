<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara’s core motive—preserving the dream against empire—clings to the reader, but interiority drifts toward exposition (“a fragile seedling to preserve this singular dream”). Embodied choices are concrete only at the violin ritual; earlier interior beats register as report. Last-image payoff earns partial credit yet emotional contradiction stays muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes: the violin’s internal shattering → tiny ice flower lodged in desert root. Sequence tracks causal beats under Accumulative/Textural lens: micro-perforations widen from resonance → propagation → empire left with husk. Cost is felt in “fragile, resonant echo blooming in the velvet dark.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Velvet drapes, mulberry light and transparent ice violin are sensorially anchored (“a fruit left too long on the branch”). Observatory and greenhouse space constrain choice and amplify acoustics; final image of ice-bloom rooted in pot recharges setting. Slight surplus on color language keeps band just under excellence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—time until empire confiscates violin—raises pressure; protagonist’s propagation tactic is a decisive narrowing of options that forecloses hiding. Empire remains off-page so conflict pressure is concept more than embodied threat, shaving off top end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme of preservation versus dominion emerges through resonant materiality: ice that fractures into fertile life. No overt moral; final reweighting of meaning (“hollow trophy” vs rooted dream) lands with oblique but lasting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Lyrical third-person limited remains distinct and controlled: “the desert rose shrieked in her mind, a single, desperate concept: propagate.” Occasional elevated diction aligns with observatory ambience; internal monologue avoids diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is tautly cadenced, sentences advance information and image simultaneously. No scaffolding loops; metaphor (“microscopic fractures like frozen constellations”) is specific and consistent. A few surplus modifiers (“relentless arctic light”) keep line just shy of perfect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Ice-crystal plant-propagation trope feels freshly synthesized: violin resonance as pollen and crystalline re-growth. Core human conflict (empire vs dream) grounded through this singular device. Risk is moderate; payoff elegant but within recognizable speculative lyric register.</comment>
