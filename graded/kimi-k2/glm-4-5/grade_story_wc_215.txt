<comment>The protagonist’s tranquil perception is shown through gesture and silence, not told, and the embodied cost—perpetual muteness as keeper—lands with credible weight. Interiority remains concrete ("the box grew warm in their hands"); however, the final shift from astonished witness to chosen guardian is more asserted via image (the bee dissolving) than dramatized through contradiction or struggle, blunting the earned-stasis edge.</comment>

<comment>Driven by an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure deepens through pattern accumulation: hives → spirits → box → silence covenant. The closure unit—release of the single bee beneath oldest hive—is Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: the recluse’s lifelong silence. Orientation anchors cleanly by sun-cracked domes; no lens contradiction at end.</comment>

<comment>Locale is vivid and selective: "prismatic shadows across the scorched wasteland," hives as micro-setting constrain behavior—silence is enforced under hollow combs. The stained glass box itself evolves from object to covenant engine under moonlight. Spatial choreography coherent within single oasis space.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the preservation of silence as covenant—exerts quiet pressure from hive whispers onward. One definitive tightening: placing the box beneath the hive on the anniversary, forfeiting speech forever. Cost is legible as the reclaimed bee departs into air, leaving tongueless vigil.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly through gesture and charged objects: covenant = mutual tending + unspeakable grief. No thematic exposition; final image (keeper hushing newcomers with finger) reweights earlier bee imagery. Silenced speech as cost renders the theme tactile—“love unconfessed” preserved, not proclaimed.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical compression sustains POV: “Sunlight fractured...,” “the box clicked open.” No unmotivated head-hop. Diction controlled inside recluse’s perceptual register; sensory narrowing (moon-bleached air) aligns with muteness. Filter verbs minimal; dialogue absent by covenant necessity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density, zero loops; each sentence advances either covenant knowledge or atmospheric charge—e.g., “wax that never hardened.” Occasional elegant inversion ("scorched wasteland") reads as voice-motivated rather than purple. Final image achieves crystalline stillness without rhetorical overgrowth.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-Veil ghosted apiary + mute keeper of unspeakable griefs. Stained glass box as covenant engine transcends prop cliché; ghosts-as-smoke echoes are transformed into active audience requiring silence penalty. Risky linguistic restraint pays off—the wordlessness itself becomes conceit and cost.</comment>
