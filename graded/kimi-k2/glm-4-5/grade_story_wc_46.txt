<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s conflicting desires—earthbound yet star-hungry—are embodied in every beat; her polished sea-glass light-shows tighten stakes from wistful dream to earned purpose. Interiority is vivid, action-rooted, and her renunciation of fire is traceable across choices with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Structure forms an accumulative/textural arc: nightly polishing intensifies pattern density until the final grotto display crystallizes meaning. Causality flows cleanly; memory resurfacing is cued by glass starlight and paid off in decisive communal sharing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Grotto, mist, and cliffside workshop are anchored early and constrain tactics—polishing must happen here, not anywhere. The serpentine walls pressure safe fireless illumination; sea-glass micro-objects charge the final light-projection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—share stars without fire—escalates through each night’s polish: risk is real loss of earthly safety vs soul-deep dream. The final display narrows every option to a single charged grotto moment with visible communal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through embodied particulars: glass and gravity re-price the premise that earthbound bodies can still touch stars. The grotto’s collective pilgrimage mirrors the final image, offering non-literal renewal without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, sensory prose reflects Elara’s stargazer curiosity under pressure; no intrusive exposition. “Reflectively vibrant” and “zephyr bloom” serve textured characterization rather than ornament, rhythm tight in peak beats.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Zero scaffolding, high information density; every sentence advances glass-polish ritual or star-sharing stakes. Metaphors stay consistent, no overwrites—compressed diction under climax pressure without clarity loss.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: medieval craft + cosmic outreach via ocean glass feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking—zero fire, pure light—heightens stakes without gimmickry; serpentine space and gravity constraint read as one-of-a-kind.</comment>
