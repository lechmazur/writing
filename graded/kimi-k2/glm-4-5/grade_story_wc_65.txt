<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her gaze sweeping,” “steady her hand”), but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final choice to draw the map is credible yet lacks a visible, felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is finished, stakes crystallize, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of detail reweights the future. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality holds, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Elara’s perception; the spire’s conductive property constrains her ability and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true, but the lake’s cracks could be more causally tied to her next beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—village survival via timely map—is signaled early and tightens once when cracks appear exactly where predicted. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal; cost is implied (time running out) but not yet viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of “innovation within constraint” emerges organically from Elara’s method and the spire’s limits. Final image of the map held to light offers quiet resonance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether prediction alone suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“ink flowed, so too would the transformative information”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful, though occasional elevated diction edges toward the poetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“dark tooth,” “shimmered with iridescent blues”) serve atmosphere without clutter. One minor paraphrase loop (“transformative information” / “sustaining transformation”) barely grazes the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>“Ignorance cartographer” is a fresh synthesis; the predictive-mapping premise is grounded in tactile detail rather than gimmick. Risk lies in the quiet ending, but it pays off through earned specificity; no close echoes detected.</comment>
