<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Martin’s contradictory impulses—profit vs. truth—are embodied in the trembling hand on the watch; the final renunciation of his trade is earned by the grandfather carving that reweights the object. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is a slight over-reliance on reflective summary before the shore scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: placing watch and carving together in the sand crystallizes the cost of decades of lies. Causal lens holds—each beat flows “because/therefore” from the discovery of the carving to the decision to close the business. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vivid, selective, and filter through Martin’s guilt; the driftwood carvings act as micro-setting that constrains his search and charges the final image. Weather and tide evolve causally. Only a touch more sensory variety could push it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. profitable deception—tightens when the unrecognized carving forces a single decisive re-evaluation. Pressure escalates under causal lens; the cost is the irrevocable loss of his fabricated identity. One clear turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited guilt and the price of erasure emerges through the carved watch hand; no moralizing, only the image of reconciled objects in sand. Subtext in the sanding patterns and initials carries the emotional freight. Final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical but precise; perceptual signature shows in “sieved hush” and tactile driftwood details. No head-hopping, no register drift. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“he recalled,” “he remembered”) in reflective block. No mixed metaphors or loops. High information density throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle on the familiar “false genealogist” trope by literalizing memory as carved driftwood. The grandfather’s preemptive forgiveness via carving is an earned inversion. Specificity of the black-market trade and cobalt terrace grounds the concept.</comment>
