<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s longing for his sister is palpable, but the interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“tears of screaming tenderness”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The micro-choice to pluck jasmine is concrete, yet the moment of contact with his sister is off-stage, muting the cost of his belief. Captain Morgan’s late softening feels like an external validation rather than a crucible that forces Elias to confront a flaw. Still, the character arc from skepticism to keeper-of-whispers is legible and earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: cork → whisper → sister’s felt response → Elias’s tearful confirmation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the vial’s warmth certifies the bridge across oceans. The orientation anchor (cobalt lighthouse at dawn) is immediate; no orientation debt. One transition (garden shard) is brief and legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from private theory to public vocation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and dawn sky are sketched with selective sensory strokes; the jasmine’s “potent and haunting” scent functions as micro-setting that constrains Elias’s method. Spatial choreography is clean: western side, neglected garden, horizon line. Weather (post-heat-wave calm) subtly mirrors the emotional thaw. The lighthouse’s “protective aura” edges toward overt symbolism but remains tied to Elias’s stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove whispers can reach the lost sister—is signaled early and tightened through the single decisive act of whispering into the cork. Agency is Elias’s; coincidence (sister happens to be a fisher in a distant village) complicates but does not resolve—the emotional confirmation still hinges on his purified intent. Cost is visible in the irreversible shift from private dream to public role. No escalation beyond this single beat, yet the deepening is sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: gentleness as a force that can traverse where force fails. The jasmine scent and cork reprise at closure reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the captain’s gruff skepticism and Elias’s silent endurance. The final image of the vial’s warmth offers a non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “the scent of a garden at night” is idiosyncratic and sensory. Rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn description to compressed action (“he uncorked the vial”). Dialogue is sparse but character-specific: Captain Morgan’s “nonsense of young dreamers” versus his softened final line. No head-hopping; the sister’s POV is handled as distant resonance, not interior access.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, with purposeful compression and no loops. Figurative language is selective: “cobalt lighthouse,” “peach and lavender” dawn. No filter-verb stacks or purple drift. One minor scaffold: “stood there for what felt like hours” could tighten, but it does not stall momentum. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motif effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—whispers purified by a magical cork—feels fresh against the maritime setting. The synthesis of ancient maritime texts with subtle mysticism avoids genre cliché. Specificity (night-blooming jasmine in a heat-scorched garden) grounds the fantastical. The transformation from skeptic to keeper-of-whispers is earned, not gimmicky. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
