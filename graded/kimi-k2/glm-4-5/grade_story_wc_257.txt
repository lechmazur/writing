<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s grief is embodied through her craft and the observatory’s presence, but interior contradiction is mostly summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final stance—continuing to guide others—feels earned by the backstory, yet the cost is stated more than felt. Motivation is consistent, yet no micro-choice under pressure crystallizes the turn; the pivot remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elena accepts perpetual guardianship with visible nightly labor as cost. Causality is thematic rather than beat-driven; the observatory appears as fated response to grief, not a choice that narrows options. Transitions are smooth, but the single reflective arc edges the BRR ceiling without fresh present-tense pressure after the midpoint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The observatory’s starlit architecture and the phoenix stencil function as micro-settings that constrain Elena’s ritual actions. Sensory detail is selective—metallic tools, warm glow—filtered through her craft priorities. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the telescope beam and alcoves ground each beat. The setting quietly mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming grief into guidance—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure deepens via nightly repetition and visitor need, but no single beat forces a trade-off or irreversible choice; escalation is accretive rather than acute. Cost is diffuse: endless labor, never dramatized as exhaustion or limitation. Agency remains steady-state caretaking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal-through-art emerges organically from Elena’s craft and origami offerings. Subtext resides in the unstated presence of her daughter within every phoenix motif. The final image—endless alcoves glowing—reweights the premise: solace is inexhaustible yet demands perpetual tending. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the quiet cadence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; Elena’s perceptual signature is filtered through tactile craft detail. Prose texture is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation matching nightly ritual. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on internal cadence and sensory idiom. Register stays within the character’s artisan lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, with high information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or motive. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“curtains of intention shimmer” teaches the world rule early. No loops or scaffold detected; pronoun and tense are clean. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise through measured cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Mourning-jewelry workshop in a dimensional observatory offers a fresh synthesis of grief-craft and cosmic liminality. Phoenix stencil and origami coordinates transform familiar symbols into functional ritual tools. Premise commits fully; no late rule changes. While echoes of “magical atelier” tropes exist, specificity of craft and cosmic scale distinguishes the piece.</comment>
