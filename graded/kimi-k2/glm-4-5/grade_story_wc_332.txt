<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven obsession is vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“luminous absence”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final acceptance feels gently earned yet lacks a visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance toward the “runaway dream” crystallizes with felt cost when she grasps her sister’s transformation. Causal chain is thin (book appears ex nihilo), but accumulative pattern of sunrise captures holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Whispering archipelago and watercolor palette are sensuously specific; the easternmost point and basement studio constrain Elara’s ritual, charging the final image of light-borne communion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost sister via light-cipher—is clear early. Escalation is one deepening: realization that presence, not recovery, is the path. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of absence) rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of presence-through-absence emerges organically from Elara’s practice; final image of “conversation in the language they now both understood” offers resonant non-moral answer. Avoids overt thesis, though “cipher of longing” flirts with label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, hushed voice sustains atmospheric cohesion; perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“improbable beginnings”) slightly strains POV modesty but remains within tolerable lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-dense; minor loops (“light…light…light”) and soft filler (“somehow present”) dull momentum slightly. No artifacts in closure beat; rhythm supports the quiet crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of photography-alchemy and ghost-light sister is fresh; avoids stock grief tropes through specificity of watercolor palette and sunrise ritual. Transformation feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
