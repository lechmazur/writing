<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s bodily memory and the “emptiness in her chest” are vivid and earned; her shift from routine to surrender is embodied, not stated. The grandmother aside fulfills BRR (anchors in scrimshaw feel and rewrites her stance). Minor drift: “true nature” nears label-speak but is rescued by concrete divestment. Earned stasis at finale: the island’s re-submersion is the visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drive lens is cumulative/textural: pressure layers of found object, re-reading, whale call, piece-by-piece detachment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—final dive charges all prior longing with “dreams and reality seamlessly merge.” No causal leaps; every beat reweights the same desire.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Sublittoral light, mercurial water, and the scrimshaw’s tactility constrain choices (she must dive in daylight; object glow limits her secrecy). Final dissolving fragments re-anchor the setting in liquid moonlight. No spatial clutter or exposition dumps, pure POV-filtrate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—escape from dock-bound expectation—is explicit early; whale call tightens the noose to “detach or remain inert.” Each scrim shard lost is a visible toll narrowing her path. Cost is body-weight lost to water when the last piece dissolves. One coherent escalation under cumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges not from argument but from ritualized divestment: “one’s true nature wasn't embraced—it was merely remembered.” Repricing happens in the final submerge; no moral delivered, only the island reabsorbing choice. Complexity sustained without tidy payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is hushed, ocean-liminal, with controlled metaphor—“light spilled across water the color of mercury.” Only two filter slips (“felt… inside her”). Whale-call as non-verbal dialogue is effective subtext. Tense steady, distance coherent. Minor lyrical excess in “liquid moonlight,” but pattern taught and paid off.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Clean propulsion, little fat. Sentence variety alternates short pulses (“she dove”) with rolling clauses. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Echo in last paragraph—“vanished like mist at sunrise”—returns image without repetition flaw. Line-level control tight to end.</question>

<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Transforms “lost island” trope into divestment ritual; not quest but relinquishment. Whale song + bone fragment combine in a synthesis that feels inevitable yet fresh (risky lyric choice holds). Specificity: “salt sugar” dissolve avoids cliché. High synthesis with earned cost lifts into 9 band—minor slip only in near-epiphanic tone.</question>
