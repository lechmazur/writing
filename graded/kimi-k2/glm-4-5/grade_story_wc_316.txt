<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s numb aurora of post-ego hollowness is embodied through micro-choices—hesitating hands, forced breath—as she channels vitality into the jar-brain; contradictory impulses (resist versus feel) play in-scene, leading to the earned renunciation of numbness. Interiority remains specific and character-bound, though secondary characters (Master Chen, rebel scientists) drift into exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Causal lens (vivify via opposites) holds from premise to the charged poise of the glowing brain; every beat advances because/therefore linkages narrowing options as history rewrites itself. Closure lands viscerally: the rewired consciousness pulses to life at the crest of the temporal wave, making before/after of Maya’s numbness legible. Orientation flags clear who/where by line 4, but a brief infodump on Great Unraveling risks –0.2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo functions as micro-setting: clouds shift, rock trembles, and temporal shimmer affects tactics during the vivify act. Specificity (obsidian pedestal jar) recharges the end-poised glow; world rules (anchor techniques vs. rewrites) constrain choice. Lovely atmospheric accumulation, though minor white-room drift only after 600+ words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free duplicate consciousness—tightens mid-story as the temporal wave forecloses options; the protagonist’s agency (channeling vitality) drives the decisive change. Escalation is cumulative, ending with perceptible cost: her numbness expires, history remakes. Comb resolves earned. Simultaneous internal/external stakes interweave cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly from duplication’s right to autonomous emotion; the final reprise (“duplicates could be individuals too”) reconfigures premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the afraid-to-feel jar, silence versus sound duality; emotional aftereffect lingers as hopeful unease. One explanatory line on “cosmic transformations” leaks but caps at –0.2.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Maya’s perceptual signature—“shimmer signaled another rewrite”—patterns foreground attention; voice stays coherent even under peak pressure. One head-hop moment (CEO backstory in rebel speech) is telegraphed if minor; otherwise lyric restraint and sentence variance serve rhythm. No empty intensifiers, no therapy-speak artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but controlled: “emptiness and fullness, nothingness and being” risks conceptual overload yet resolves at the brain-pulse. No paraphrase loops; a few “history rewrites itself” echoes avoid template cadence via context shift. Occasional elevated register (“temporal wave of unmaking and remaking of causality”) bends slightly beyond POV but reads intentional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ego-death vantage reframed as vivifier of duplicates. Transformation is specific—Maya slices through her own pretense of numbness via the brain. Charged poise at the end (“room for both of us”) moves the genre beyond clone trope into emergent individuality. No derivative reset button.</comment>
