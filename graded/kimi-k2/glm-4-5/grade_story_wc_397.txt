<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet clinging to the parasol—are embodied in tactile micro-choices; the shift from escape to connection is earned by her handling of the heirloom and the final decision to stay. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Marcus functions only as gentle foil, so relationship crucible is minimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the drift-ice, parasol, and wind accumulate meaning until the final image crystallizes a stance—Elena’s renunciation of suicide. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: she forfeits the planned ending. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marina’s cracking ice and windborne solace are not backdrop; they constrain movement and mirror Elena’s loosening grip on finality. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static postcard effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s wish to “learn the sound of endings”—tightens once when she recognizes the quiet melt as a beginning. Agency is renunciation, not external victory; cost is the forfeiture of her original plan. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ice’s quiet melt reframes death as transformation. No moralizing; the final image of stars above thawing ice offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in Marcus’s silence and Elena’s tear-tracked cheeks deepens the question without answering it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elena’s loosened perception; syntax lengthens with reflection, shortens under wind. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs serve character. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“Endings can be quiet”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances image or interiority. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“windborne solace”) is earned by Elena’s drifting cognition. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourism meets disaster relief in a fresh synthesis; the parasol tip transforms from memento-mori to bridge. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, but it pays off in the final image. No template echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
