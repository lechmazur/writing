<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s sensory gift is embodied early and tied to the cave descent, but interior contradiction is thin; the fossil’s “choice” of her feels asserted rather than earned through visible flaw or cost. The final acceptance of role is credible yet sketched more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Maya exits with fossil and purpose, a Resonant Reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—why the fossil waited for her is asserted, not demonstrated—but the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coastal cave is vividly anchored; the hovering fossil becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Selective sensory detail (thermal colors, cool stone) supports POV priorities without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate the unknown—surfaces early; pressure tightens when the fossil responds to touch, forcing a decision. Cost is implied (burden of voice) but not yet viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of post-hibernation knowledge transfer emerges through action and image; the fossil’s silence and Maya’s acceptance create quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext is present but could carry more contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays coherent; perceptual signature is consistent, with sensory bias guiding detail. Rhythm is steady, though syntax flirts with template cadence in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clear and propulsive; occasional scaffold (“she realized…”) and mild synonym loops (“emotional imprints… emotional residues”) dull peak moments slightly. No artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Premise of emotion-mapping after mass hibernation feels fresh; fossil-as-transitional-object is specific and non-generic. Risk is moderate but execution holds.</comment>
