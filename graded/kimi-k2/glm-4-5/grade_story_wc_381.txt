<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but drifts toward abstraction; the summoner’s contradictory impulses (“quiet intensity” vs “tranquil blaze”) are stated rather than embodied. Micro-choices—tracing symbols, positioning the wing—are present yet feel choreographed rather than pressured. The final release of the crane earns a credible renunciation, but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the prophecy is absorbed and the crane released, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the world from threat to peace. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each beat thickens the hush until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no temporal or spatial drift. The only gap is the missing on-page cost—no visible exhaustion or forfeiture after the ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The brook, moonlight, and paper wing are rendered with selective sensory detail that filters through the summoner’s ritual focus. The wing’s translucence and the water’s breathing rhythm constrain pacing and mirror internal state. While the larger cosmos is invoked, the micro-setting—the circle of stones, the folded paper—does the real work of guiding choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying quiet rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wing begins to interface with the unseen, narrowing options to release or rupture. Cost is implied but not viscerally paid; tension remains atmospheric rather than corporeal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting disruptive knowledge into peaceful acceptance emerges through the ritual’s sensory arc rather than statement. The crane’s final glide reweights the earlier “coded prophecy” into wordless dissolution. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence; no moralizing intrudes. The resonance is quiet but legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with the summoner’s contemplative stance. Syntax modulates with ritual tempo—long breath-like sentences early, shorter pulses at climax. No POV leakage or register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“terrestrially cosmic”) risks abstraction but stays within the summoner’s arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready, with rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition. A few soft loops—“quiet brook,” “terrestrially cosmic”—repeat without new pressure. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is high, yet clarity holds. One paraphrase loop near midpoint (“the quiet brook’s sound rose and fell like breathing… harmonizing with the summoner's own pulse”) could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of origami, prophecy, and ritual silence feels fresh, avoiding stock fantasy templates. The crane-as-container trope is transformed through tactile paper physics and lunar interface. Specificity of the “mapping silence” method gives the piece a signature angle. Risk is moderate—lyric ritual rather than action set-piece—but coherence never wavers.</comment>
