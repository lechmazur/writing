<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s fierce-tender motivation—finding the unspoken apology before it turns to permanent loss—drives every traversal under the mangroves, but her interiority occasionally drifts into reverie rather than concrete choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal spine—“because she seeks the unwritten letter—therefore she braves the labyrinth—therefore the window scripts condensation”—lands cleanly; only the final forgiveness across time stretches plausibility beyond single-scene evidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mangrove density breathes, spirits weave harmonies, moonlight stitches the shard; the setting is sensuous yet sparse enough that each brush of root or glint guides movement instead of ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: recover or renounce the apology. Pressure tightens once—spiral into the labyrinth’s heart—ending crystallized by the window’s apology/fear/fear/forgive cycle. One credible felt cost in the tear and pressing brow to glass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme flares from the concrete unsent letters trapping “time trapped in time,” distilled into the fierceness of still choosing tenderness. No moral sloganeering; final image reweights choice via “I was afraid” rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, corpse-cold syntax under moon-heat; chanting spirits’ layered diction stays specific to this voice. Interior monologue grounded in sensory friction: “rainspout shard pulsed warm.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Economy of metaphor—“moonlight repairing cracks”—drives verb choice and rhythm without purple drift. One repeated root “fierce tenderness” kept taut by context shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Use of cryptyc medium + healing moon-gargoyle in mangrove ritual spins familiar epistolary grief into fresh lyrical lament; endpoint concept prices apology across silence, not text.</comment>
