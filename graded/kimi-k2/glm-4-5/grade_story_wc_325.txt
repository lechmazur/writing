<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s claustrophobia is named but never embodied in concrete sensory or behavioral detail; her interiority remains evocative yet generic. Motivation to “stand by the unremembered” is stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—tomorrow she will return—earns mild resonance but lacks visible cost. Voice is consistent, but contradictions (claustrophobia vs. steady breathing) flatten the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts perpetual service, foreclosing a normal life. The causal chain (tide window → Codex activation → guiding shadows) is coherent under a Causal lens. Orientation is immediate; transitions are smooth. The only drag is a mid-story exposition dump on Dr. Thorne that stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Facility, cables, and ocean are rendered with tactile specificity—salt-stained concrete, humming pipes, creeping tide—that constrain every beat. The gold-fleck Codex glows in direct response to cable EM fields, charging the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. One minor lapse: “ghosts” remain atmospheric rather than spatially anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding the unremembered before the tide returns—is signaled early and tightened by the literal 42-minute clock. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to continue rather than escape. Cost is implied (lost career, perpetual return) but not viscerally felt on the page. Escalation is steady, not steep, yet coherent under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s persistence versus erasure emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement. Subtext lives in the silence between crashing waves and the unspoken fate of the brother. The final image—waves reclaiming the portal—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. One soft echo: “sacred silence” edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the “crashing hush.” Sensory filter is character-specific: Elara notices electromagnetic shimmer and tidal pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily lifts out of register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences carry multiple jobs. Metaphors are fresh—“tired giant,” “fibrous veins”—and stay coherent. One paraphrase loop (“she had found… she had discovered”) is minor. No scaffolding or artifact clusters in peak beats. Final paragraph cadence is controlled and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses psychic rescue with undersea cable infrastructure in a way that feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Tropes (ghosts, ancient codex) are grounded in electromagnetic science and tidal mechanics. Specificity of the abandoned 1968 facility and lunar-tide portal creates memorable texture. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
