<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s guilt vs. preserver’s drive—are embodied in trembling fingers and micro-choices (restoring the portrait with arsonist knowledge). The final image of her future self at peace crystallizes earned change with visible cost. Minor slip: “analytically intuitive” is label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored portrait reveals her own face, reweighting the premise. Causal chain holds—each artistic clue because/therefore leads to the next, culminating in the tapestry’s instruction. Cost is legible in the volcanic tenderness of that moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive’s dusty halls and the tapestry fragment act as micro-setting that constrains choice; the fragment is literally woven into the new library’s entrance. Sensory detail is selective—faded threads, volcanic tenderness—filtered through Maya’s guilt-driven perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is signaled early and tightened when the portrait’s restoration forces Maya to confront her past. Escalation is causal: each artwork narrows options until the final tapestry forecloses hiding. Cost is the irreversible self-reckoning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of destruction vs. preservation emerges organically from Maya’s choices; the tapestry’s message “Fire destroys, but art preserves” is earned, not asserted. Final image of the restored portrait reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—trembling fingers, volcanic tenderness—and modulates with pressure. No dialogue, but interiority is character-specific and avoids therapy-speak except one instance. Patterned elision (years passing) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“volcanic tenderness”) is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor register drift in “analytically intuitive” but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise of arsonist-turned-archivist via ancient memory-tapestries is fresh; transformation test fails if names change. Risk-taking in lyric compression and non-linear time pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
