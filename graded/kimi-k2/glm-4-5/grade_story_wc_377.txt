<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s seasonal muteness and inherited duty give her a clear, embodied motive; the interior contradiction between silence and heightened perception is shown through her bell-tuning micro-choices. Yet her arc is largely observational—she “discovers,” “knows,” “works,” but the decisive cost of her final climb is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spectrum pulse at her death crystallizes the community’s new language and immortalizes wonder. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tuning session layers density until the final cadence shift. The Orientation Test is met early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering bluff and bell tower are tactile, wind-borne, and light-soaked; the iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains every tuning decision. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the final image of the sculpture glistening atop the bluff recharges the opening vista.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder via resonant light—is signaled early and escalates through each tuning session. One meaningful tightening: the fragment never dims, forcing Elara to sustain the spectrum even as her body fails. Cost is felt in her aging hands, though the final price is more elegiac than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: communication beyond language, the ethics of wonder, the cost of guardianship. Subtext resides in color pulses rather than exposition. The final spectrum offers a non-literal, resonant answer—no moralizing, only charged silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to vibration and hue. Syntax modulates with intensity; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful—seasonal shifts taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective and never muddies causality. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial gift,” “immortalized”) edges toward purple but stays within Elara’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of synesthetic sculpture with post-linguistic society feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes—mute seer, fallen star—are transformed through sensory specificity and communal stakes. Risk-taking (silent color language) heightens coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
