<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ethan’s meticulous nature is shown through concrete action (mapping cracks, noting mist-forms), but interior contradiction is muted; the “trembling certainty” is declared rather than embodied. Motivation crystallizes late yet feels consistent; the integration of the ticket punch as bodily extension supplies a visible cost that forecloses return to ordinary mapping.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of Ethan walking the city with altered perception reconfigures his prior life and signals irreversible cost. Causal chain holds—ticket punch summons vault, vault grants partial knowledge, knowledge rewrites perception—though the vault’s rules are taught more by atmosphere than action. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The starlit vault and copper box are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides Ethan’s choices; the ticket punch’s warmth and vibration act as micro-setting that constrains his grip and next move. Spatial choreography is clean; the cracks’ arrow pattern is tracked consistently. Environment charges the final image by persisting as altered vision aboveground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightened when the vault begins to flicker, forcing Ethan to leave with only partial knowledge. The cost is the inability to remain; this felt forfeiture narrows options and sets up the iterative return. Escalation is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of symbols increases until the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping hidden human truths emerges organically from Ethan’s occupation and the vault’s emotion-forms; no explicit moralizing. The final image of invisible connections reweights earlier mapping obsession into ethical responsibility. Subtext operates through gesture—the ticket punch’s beam translating fortress walls—rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinctively analytical yet lyrical (“geometric symphonies,” “encrypted light”) consistent with Ethan’s perceptual signature. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No POV drift; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Rhythm modulates with scene urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“starlit vault in mist,” “crystalline structure…shimmering with encrypted light”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple tasks. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Final line lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses mundane urban exploration with metaphysical cartography in a fresh synthesis; the ticket-punch-as-cipher feels inevitable once revealed. Tropes of mystical objects and hidden chambers are transformed through Ethan’s specific occupation and the Accumulative/Textural lens. Risk in non-linear vault logic pays off by reconfiguring surface reality.</comment>
