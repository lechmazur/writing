<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstract self-labeling ("molts personalities like Phoenix feathers"); the poet’s contradictory impulses are present but not fully embodied in micro-choices. The mission to “forge beauty from anarchy” is clear, yet the cost of each molt remains more asserted than dramatized. Elias functions as off-page backstory rather than relationship crucible, limiting pressure on the poet’s present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of the poet scattering seeds under starlight crystallizes the ongoing resistance with felt conceptual cost—beauty must be rebuilt nightly. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of rebuilding and molting tightens through density rather than causal turns. Orientation is established early; no teleporting props or timeline breaks. One minor drift: “luminous fracture” is repeated without reweighting until the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rusted open-air library is vivid, tactile, and constrains action: missing roof admits moonlight and weather, forcing the poet to work by night and guard against decay. Seeds and books intermingle as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions. Weather and decay subtly mirror the poet’s splintered psyche without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting knowledge from erasure—is signaled early and escalates through nightly rebuilding. Pressure tightens when the poet acknowledges “They’ll burn our stories,” yet the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; no single beat narrows options decisively. Cost is conceptual (endless labor, identity loss) rather than concrete. Agency is present but diffuse across montage-like beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty as resistance emerges organically from the poet’s actions and the library’s decay; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates through image—pressed flowers, seeds, rust—rather than statement. Final image reweights prior motifs without sermon: “beauty the authorities couldn’t burn.” Complexity is honored; no tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters decay and moonlight through the poet’s shifting personas. Compression and elision (“time moved differently when your identity shifted like moon phases”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Dialogue is absent, appropriate to solitary scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional metaphor stacking (“luminous fracture,” “cerebral cathedral”) risks overwriting but stays within voice. Rhythm modulates with scene needs. No loops or paraphrase drift. Minor filter-verb clusters (“the poet often wondered”) slightly dull immediacy mid-text.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a shapeshifting librarian rebuilding a ruined library with contraband seeds feels fresh; tropes of resistance and decay are transformed through sensory specificity. Risk-taking in structure (lyric montage) heightens mood without obscuring clarity. One near-echo: “beauty from anarchy” flirts with slogan but is earned by action.</comment>
