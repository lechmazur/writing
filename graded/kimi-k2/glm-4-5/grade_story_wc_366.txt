<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet guardianship and embodied loneliness are vivid; the final act of adding his stone and letter crystallizes a credible shift from isolation to lineage. Interiority stays concrete, but the “warmly observant” trait is asserted more than dramatized until the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s deliberate stone-stack and letter seal a new belonging. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact (glass, letters, stones) layers meaning until the final image reweights his solitude. Cost is palpable in the vial of seawater he pockets.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern room’s salt-oil scent and vibrating floorboard anchor every discovery; the sea-glass and stone stack function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elias’s final gesture. Fog, darkness, and beam rotation are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lonely custodianship versus inherited fellowship—tightens when the lamp dies and the hidden archive is revealed. One clear escalation: the discovery forces Elias to choose between silent routine and active guardianship of the chain. Cost is the emotional exposure of writing his own letter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of trans-generational guardianship emerges through concrete objects and actions; no moralizing. The final image of the relit beam “imbued with the presence of all who had tended it” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of solitude versus connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s reticent, sea-weathered perception; diction is spare yet textured (“the pause between thunderclaps”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on consistent interior cadence and sensory filtering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional lyrical lifts (“luminescent ache”) are earned. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to move”) is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The anonymous letter-chain-as-stone-stack tradition feels fresh and inevitable; it transforms the haunted-lighthouse trope into quiet ancestral stewardship. Specificity of the jade sea-glass marker and impossible stone balance gives the concept staying power.</comment>
