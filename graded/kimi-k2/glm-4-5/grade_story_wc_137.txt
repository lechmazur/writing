<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptic-to-believer arc is legible and embodied in her tactile handling of the tile, but the interior contradiction between doubt and wonder is stated more than dramatized; the final choice to open the tower feels earned yet slightly abstract, lacking a single on-page moment where the cost of that openness is viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower becomes a sanctuary, the tile a passage. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each transcription thickens the pattern until the final cadence reweights memory itself. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, but the reconfiguration is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tower, whales, and tile form a coherent micro-setting that constrains Elara’s choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; the unheard symphony threads through every beat, grounding the speculative premise in tactile atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal memory—signaled early. Pressure tightens as Elara moves from private transcription to public invitation; the cost is the exposure of her solitude, but the price is more asserted than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of interconnected memory emerges organically from pattern and whale song; the final image of the open tower reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. Subtext is carried by silence and resonance rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s precise perceptual bias. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “unheard symphony”) edges toward thesaurus drift but remains within the reflective register taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. A few stock phrases (“ancient migrations,” “celestial dance”) slightly dull specificity, but compression and clarity are strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of whale song, star maps, and memory-sharing tile feels fresh and inevitable. The quiet speculative premise avoids gimmickry; the risk of lyric quietude pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
