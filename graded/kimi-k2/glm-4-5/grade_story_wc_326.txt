<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (heartbeat counting as lifeline), but the digital-ghost premise is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, and the final “acceptance” is more summary than earned choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“failure is transformation”—but the cost is abstract; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ink-pattern density, yet the final beat merely re-states rather than re-weights the premise with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Opal observatory under snow is atmospherically rich and filters every perception; the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the ink ritual. Weather halts at closure, mirroring internal stillness—setting actively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—wisdom from system failure—is signaled early; pressure tightens via ink-pattern revelation, but escalation is more intellectual than visceral, lacking a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of “error as portal” emerges organically from ink webs and heartbeat tether; avoids moralizing, yet the final insight is slightly abstract, muting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“digital consciousness humming,” “snow globe of night.” No POV drift; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense without clutter; occasional poetic layering (“captured auroras”) risks overwriting but stays within voice. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-in-the-machine and ink-divination tropes; digital limbo + heartbeat counting feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
