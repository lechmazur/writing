<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich and embodied—her “steady hand” and “small frame radiating power” show contradiction between stature and authority. The final self-unmasking is earned by prior dread and ink-propelled choices. Yet the exile backstory is summarized, not dramatized, blunting the flaw-to-cost arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pretender is her own fear, time restarts, and the library’s collapse is the felt cost. Causal chain—ink → rune → revelation—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline dome, dissolving shelves, and dust motes are vivid and selective; the library’s decay literally constrains her final ritual. Micro-setting (ink-stained palm) doubles as charged object. A few floating spatial references (“shafts of light”) keep it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim truth/identity—tightens when messages bleed “like wounds” and the library begins to die. One decisive deepening: the pretender is herself. Cost is the library’s total loss, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-sovereignty emerges through concrete ritual and collapsing archive; no explicit moralizing. Final image—ink dissolving into light—reweights “power flows through truth” without stating it. Subtext in fluttering pages and bleeding ink carries the argument.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, elevated diction fits an ancient, timeless mind; rhythm modulates with urgency (“shelves crumbled into dust”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional ornate phrasing (“regally unpretentious heir”) nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“ink bleeding like wounds”) serve double duty. No loops or filler. One mixed metaphor—“time shatter” alongside “sand” dissolution—momentarily jars, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms the “lost heir reclaims throne” trope into interior self-confrontation via magical librarianship. Iron-gall ink as memory-key and library as psyche feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky collapse-of-setting gambit pays off.</comment>
