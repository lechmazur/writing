<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (preserve community identity) are clear and consistent, but interiority stays general; we see no contradictory impulse under pressure. His final declaration is credible yet lacks embodied cost—the bell is handed down, not wrested from him. Mira and the teens remain functional extensions rather than crucibles. Still, the intergenerational bond feels lived-in.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: scarcity → midnight runs → checkpoint news → expanded commitment. Closure is a public declaration (Decisive Change) that widens the mission; cost is implied in future scarcity, not yet felt. Orientation is swift; terra-cotta arbor anchors place and ritual. One micro-turn suffices under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and ridge provide spatial and social anchor; the antique bell is handled twice, constraining ritual timing. Sensory detail is selective—moonlight, still air—filtered through communal vigilance. Setting guides choice: the ridge’s isolation both protects and limits. No single object recharges the final image, so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signaled early and tightened by checkpoint news. Escalation is one deepening: “they will need more than we can provide.” Agency lies in Elias’s public expansion of the runs; cost is deferred, not dramatized. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Theme of communal resilience emerges through ritual and anonymous giving; no overt moralizing. Subtext lives in the bell’s silence and the youths’ nocturnal trust. Final declaration reframes anonymity as collective ownership, offering quiet resonance. Complexity is present but not sharply tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias; diction is calm, slightly ceremonial, fitting “amplified quiet.” No head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (Mira’s checkpoint warning). Rhythm modulates with scene tension. Voice is consistent yet not strikingly idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is restrained—no muddle. Occasional generic phrasing (“hope had not”) is minor. Strong paragraphing supports momentum. No artifacts in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</question>
<comment>Familiar refugee-resilience arc is refreshed by the anonymous-donation ritual and antique bell lineage. Specificity of midnight runs and terra-cotta arbor grounds the trope. No bold structural risk, but synthesis feels organic. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty.</comment>
