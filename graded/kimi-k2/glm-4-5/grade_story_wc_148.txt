<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“hovering at the threshold… suspended in that liminal space”), but the son’s contradictory impulses remain largely summarized rather than dramatized in scene; the final “whisper the truth” is earned by pattern rather than a visible micro-choice with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice now bears his own story, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned repetitions tighten toward the final image—yet causality between beats is more associative than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Copperlight repose, salt-sorrow scent, and the reef’s wreckage are vivid and selective; the lattice and door-scuffs function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—threading his own story before discovery—is signaled early and tightens once through the decision to write on the walls; cost is implied but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of inherited falsehood versus self-authored truth emerges organically from image and action; the final lattice image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed syntax, patterned diction, copperlight motif—remains controlled under pressure; POV is stable and perceptual signature is consistent, though no dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information load; occasional near-repetitions (“lighthouse prison off a jagged reef”) and stacked metaphors flirt with overwriting but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fable inversion feels fresh: the son’s redemption is quiet, textual, and spatial rather than dramatic; the lattice-as-confessional and copperlight motif are specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
