<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eira’s interior landscape—contradiction between duty and fear of silence—drives every strike, her synesthetic perceptions twisting color/music choices that reconfigure both space and stakes at the climax. Passivity never creeps in; each micro-move births a new color, evidencing a hierarchy of values with visible cost (felt aurora bloom migrates into white-light closure).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality holds under Accumulative lens: the aurora pattern steer/ bloom-into-white climax reweights meaning, the sculpted hush a Resonant Reconfiguration that forges “silence as presence.” Cost is palpable—held breath crystallizes before the final peal, homestead lost to wonder-as-essential. Timeline and POV remain rock-steady.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ice cavern’s crystalline acoustics behave like resonant tools—aurora light filters sculpt the strike pattern—directly steering tactics; cap raises slightly because removal would force new physics for the sound-light fusion. Spatial choreography tracks; environmental pressure tightens her reach and strike placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Primary stake—“certify wonder as essential to a numbed world”—escalates after each note locks another sensory layer; silence becomes weapon and gift. No slack reversals; cost tightens when prior peals eliminate escape, the final chord an earned renunciation of mere beauty in favor of transmissible silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from synesthetic palette → sculpted hush; ending image refracts all color into white without dictum, repricing silence itself as connective tissue of living beings. No sermonizing—wonder’s necessity is left vibrating, a resonant aftereffect rather than lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close tracks Eira’s select perception—“colors sing secrets”—and flexes cadence under pressure; compression (“hear the clarion call of distant stars”) remains coherent. Synesthetic stamp never lapses into diagnostic label and maintains perceptual signature to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythms accelerate with each bell strike; density high without figurative glutting because metaphors originate in the focalizer’s confirmed synesthesia. A couple synonym loops (“prismatic displays / prismatic peals”) knock a sliver, but not at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Voice specificity carries freshness—sound interpreted as visible color guiding choice—while using carried forward metaphors (aurora as sheet music) rather than borrowed quirks. The final refracted white light is a non-obvious inventive resolution instead of tidy triumph.</comment>
