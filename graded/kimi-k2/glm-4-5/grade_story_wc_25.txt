<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlo’s trait of recognizing walks is dramatized early and pays off when he tracks Vance, but the interior contradiction between his quiet pride and fear of discovery is only sketched. The final “shrug” and key gesture show earned restraint, yet the cost feels light for the word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the whisper system outperforms Vance’s shouts, crystallizing Marlo’s quiet authority. Causal chain is tight—maps, coin, acoustics all feed the payoff—but the absence of a visible price keeps it just below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The humming containers, rain puddles, and acoustic corridors are vivid and selective; the storm’s interference with electronics directly enables the whisper gambit. Micro-setting (the welded seams as “acoustic highways”) constrains tactics and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers beat shouts—is signaled early and tightened when Marlo positions himself at the junction. The storm and blackout raise cost, but the final victory feels frictionless; no tangible loss is dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of quiet mastery versus bluster emerges through action and acoustics rather than statement. The reweighted meaning of “whispers” lands in the final image, though the moral cost remains muted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, tactile, and filtered through Marlo’s sensory bias; the rhythmic listing of footfalls and metallic hums is distinctive. No head-hop; diction stays within the maintenance worker’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive, with only minor filter-verb clusters (“he seemed to notice”). Sensory specificity and sentence variety support momentum; no loops or mixed metaphors intrude on the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The acoustic labyrinth and whisper-navigation premise feel fresh, synthesizing maritime noir with subtle fantasy. Risk is moderate but coherent; the story commits fully to its quiet magic without gimmickry.</comment>
