<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s curiosity and protective drive are embodied in tactile micro-choices—tightening fingers on the hearing aid, whispering into it, sitting with the child. The final re-framing of the photograph shows earned change with visible cost: her grandmother’s warning finally fulfilled. Interiority stays specific and sensory, avoiding label-speak. Only the child’s voice slips toward generic innocence, keeping the score just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: each beat follows “because/therefore” from the urgent pulse to the garden, the recognition, the call to security. Closure lands on-page with the photograph re-framed and the hearing aid calmed—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis (how Elena links photo to predator) is motivated by prior emotional residue and does not break linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and twilight garden are vivid yet selective, filtering through Elena’s tuned perception. The hearing aid itself functions as micro-setting, constraining every move she makes. Final image of the re-framed photograph re-weights the space from mourning ground to vigilance site. A touch more non-visual sensory detail could have pushed it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting the child—emerges at the first frantic pulse and tightens with each step toward the garden. Agency is Elena’s: she decodes the warning, confronts the situation, and acts. Cost is the belated realization that her grandmother’s last sight was a failed rescue attempt. One clear escalation beat suffices under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of posthumous guardianship emerges organically from the plot rather than statement. The photograph’s re-weighting offers a resonant, non-literal answer: vigilance can outlive death. Subtext in the child’s “nice man” line carries chilling implication without exposition. Final paragraph avoids moralizing, letting image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrically compressed, and filtered through Elena’s precise sensory bias—“reeling hush,” “ethereal fog,” “frantic pulse.” Syntax modulates with urgency; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext. One near-cliché (“unspeakable fate”) is forgivable at this length and does not contaminate the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “resonance”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—contact-tracing the dead via antique hearing aid—is fresh yet grounded in emotional truth. The incidental heroism twist feels inevitable once the photograph’s latent warning is revealed. Specificity of the obsolete device and the grandmother’s last sighting transforms familiar rescue tropes. Risky compression pays off in a single charged image.</comment>
