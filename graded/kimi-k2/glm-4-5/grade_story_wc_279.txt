<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his “lilac unease” is embodied, not labeled—and his micro-choices (tilting a ridge of green sand) directly enact his social perceptiveness. The final renunciation of chalk carries felt cost. Yet the crowd remains a single undifferentiated mass, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mandala’s resonance converts zealot anger into wonder, a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible social cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added grain tightens the grotto’s acoustic pattern. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist and stone constrain every choice—sand sticks to dampness, whispers refract off curved walls. The tile flake functions as micro-setting that literally channels sound into Silas’s ear. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the grotto’s meaning be destroyed or embraced—tightens when zealots arrive. Silas’s agency (adjusting sand angles) escalates stakes by making hidden cultural memory audible. Cost is the irreversible dispersal of the mandala at dusk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: chaos is not the enemy but the medium of wisdom. The final image—collective hush turning from unease to contentment—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture and pattern, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas; perceptual signature is consistent (“whispers only he could fully comprehend”). Prose texture is lyrical yet disciplined, with purposeful repetition (“emergent hush”) that accrues meaning. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; high-density lines (“sand mandala seemed to amplify…”) advance both image and plot. Occasional soft filter (“seemed”) is voice-motivated. No loops or mixed metaphors; clarity remains intact at climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of chalk artist + acoustic grotto + sand mandala feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of zealots through art rather than argument subverts expected confrontation. Specificity of the tile flake and lilac unease prevents template drift.</comment>
