<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his trembling hands, the “weight of all the souls” he’s buried—but the shift from undertaker to keeper feels slightly abstract; the cost of this transformation is asserted rather than embodied. His stubbornness is named, not dramatized in a moment of costly choice. Still, the final image of sanctuary among the waves gives him a credible new identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: package → coordinates → descent → lens restoration → beacon relit. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias becomes keeper, the library’s beacon restored, cost felt in his permanent exile beneath the waves. The lens ambiguity (why it calls him) is left poetic rather than resolved, but this aligns with the accumulative/textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The salt-stained canvas, fractured glass catching rainbows, and the impossible geometry of the underwater library are sharply rendered and serve the stakes: the setting’s pressure (depth, ghosts, physics) forces Elias’s final choice. The lens itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rest for the wandering dead—intensifies when Elias realizes the lens’s purpose. One meaningful tightening: the moment he fits the last shard and the beam reconfigures the library into sanctuary. Cost is the loss of surface life, legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-rest emerges organically through the lens and the library; no explicit moralizing. The final image—beacon beneath waves—offers a non-literal answer to what “rest” means, reweighting Elias’s lifelong labor into eternal preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and specific to Elias’s undertaker’s gaze (“souls he’d committed to earth”). Occasional elevated diction (“impossible spaces”) risks register drift but stays within the story’s mythic tone. No head-hopping; POV remains steady.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with strong rhythmic control and vivid compression (“fish scattered like silver thoughts”). Minor scaffold in phrases like “weight of all the souls” and “chased stillness” but no loops or artifacts that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—undertaker restoring an underwater library with a broken lighthouse lens—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lost city, guiding beacon) are transformed through Elias’s vocation and the quiet inversion of burial into preservation.</comment>
