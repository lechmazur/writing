<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elina is vivid as the tactile, sensory archivist—“her duty to compile fragments” is shown through the chest, diary, and valve—yet her internal conflict is less embodied; vision gifts feel like granted magical skill rather than dilemma until the final quiet renunciation. Micro-choice at 700 words—“she shared this with the returnees”—lands as earned stance with cost, yet earlier stakes are soft and “visions [that] flood her mind” remain narrated not bodily felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the trumpet valve’s found-beat plus diary trigger a single deepening cascade that reweights exile-history and steers the group toward communal healing; closure’s Charged Poise in “home, at last, was … a shared understanding” earns its resonance. Linkage because therefore remains loose—vision leaps feel gifted rather than fought for—but the final image crystallizes stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor’s glistening stones and briny air frame immediate mood; “empty spaces where families … had been removed” smartly mirrors theme. Yet the micro-setting never physically constrains her—no doors slammed, no weather impeding retrieval—so constraint is thematic only, not tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to transform fragments into community repair”—is declared, but pressure accrues gently; tightening comes once when Elina chooses to tell the herald’s truth at cost of possible discord. Cost is soft (“anger softening to sorrow”) rather than palpable sacrifice; escalation remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of absences-redeemed emerges from concrete details—trumpet valve, herald’s sacrifice, returned faces—without abstract moralizing. Final resonance reweights earlier emptiness into “shared understanding” with credible poignancy; no final-sentence thesis delivered aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Lyric third-person close, rhythmic and sensory (“briny scent”, “glistening stones”) with consistent perceptual bias. No POV drift or dialogue missteps; filter verbs occasionally stack yet serve atmospheric compression rather than clutter. Final cadence, quiet and earned, stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Texture is lush but disciplined: “rain washed away the years of separation” is clean metaphor, not overwritten. Few loop penalties—minor repeated stems (“each revelation… each piece”)—dampen but never obscure the closing image. Read-aloud rhythm holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ocean-spray archivist as post-exile memory cartographer is new; “navigated absences” as archival method transforms exile cliché. No stock tropes; specifics (trumpet valve as herald’s mouthpiece) feel inevitable after reveal.</comment>
