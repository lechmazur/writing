<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. learned patience—surface in the trammel beat, but the interiority drifts toward summary (“she had learned patience”) rather than embodied contradiction at the moment of choice. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost (absorbing the memory into the card), yet the emotional layering flattens slightly under lyrical abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the memory is re-contained, the card re-weighted, and the orchard exhales—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful—roots cradle bones, guiding Elara’s path and constraining her kneeling posture at the climax. Micro-setting (the oldest tree’s root-stone) directly hosts the decisive act. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but tactile and kinesthetic cues keep it embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending a torn soul—signaled early and tightened once when the specter fights return. Escalation is accretive: each symbolic gesture (card, roots, whispered symbols) increases pressure until the memory yields. Cost is visible in the card’s added weight and Elara’s solitary vigil.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of renewal-through-loss emerges organically from the orchard’s life-death reciprocity and Elara’s sacrificial bargain. Final image of lantern-lit corridors reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the card’s scorched patterns avoids explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors Elara’s hushed intensity. Perceptual signature—fingers reading root-maps, dust motes as meaning—remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (“roots укрепed by the newly returned peace”). Minor scaffold in “fierce gentleness” repetition, but it serves motif. No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: necropolis-as-orchard refigures death into regenerative matrix; burned Tower card repurposed as soul-patch is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence without gimmickry. Specificity of root-bone interface prevents generic fantasy drift.</comment>
