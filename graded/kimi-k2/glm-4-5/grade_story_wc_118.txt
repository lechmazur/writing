<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The historian’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts toward summary (“felt a sense of purpose that transcends”). Embodied emotion is sparse; most reactions are abstract (“smiled, a rare expression”). Micro-choices are present but not sharply contradictory; the final preservation act is earned yet low-cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the historian recommits to preservation with a charged image of possible return. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern builds through repeated bronze-quiet echoes. No orientation debt. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening the landing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is vivid and specific—“curved walls,” “metal bones”—and its bronze quiet constrains perception. The hearth and tapestry act as micro-settings that guide discovery. Spatial choreography is coherent; the environment subtly shapes the historian’s movements and choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving stories before final fade—is signaled early. Escalation is gentle: each artifact deepens knowledge but never threatens immediate failure. No visible price is paid; tension remains atmospheric rather than tactical. One meaningful deepening occurs when dragons are linked to the axis shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory as living architecture emerges organically from setting and action. Subtext is carried by silence and bronze resonance. Final image of “world that might yet be again” offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Avoids overt thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-locked. Syntax and diction suit a solitary, reverent consciousness. Compression and elision are purposeful; “bronze quiet” is taught early and recurs with reweighted meaning. No dialogue, so voice carries full load effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“testaments to a world before the axis shifted”) flirts with register drift but stays within lyrical bounds. Density is high; few wasted words. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-dream world preserved in a missile-silo library—feels fresh and specific. Dragons as cosmic axis-keepers is an inventive mythic graft. Risk is moderate; execution is confident. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if setting or premise were swapped.</comment>
