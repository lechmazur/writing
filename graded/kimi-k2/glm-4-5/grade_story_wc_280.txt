<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s longing for an endless encore is vivid and embodied, but the interior contradiction—his need to let go in order to save the garden—remains stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final dissolution feels inevitable yet not fully earned by a prior micro-choice that visibly costs him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the garden is restored and Silas dissolves, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sung echo tightens the weave—though the midpoint could be sharper in showing the irreversible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The moonlit maze, moss-grown stage, and synesthetic orchard are selective and atmospheric; the tarot coin and synesthetic perceptions function as micro-settings that constrain Silas’s tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the garden’s rules (how song mends time) are learned more by assertion than by action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the garden’s survival—signals early and escalates as each sung echo tightens the temporal weave. One meaningful deepening occurs when Silas’s form flickers, showing the cost of giving spectral essence to the song; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of art’s endurance beyond death emerges organically from Silas’s final performance; the closing image of a young tenor discovering the garden offers a non-literal, resonant answer. No overt moralizing, though the “hope” motif flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with synesthetic metaphors (“tasted of thunder,” “petals tasting like laughter”) that remain consistent to Silas’s perception. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense, occasionally risking purple overload (“silver-blue glow that tasted of thunder”), but the cadence supports the aria-like structure. No loops or scaffold; information density is high, though a few stacked modifiers could be pruned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing a ghost’s farewell aria with synesthetic time-repair feels fresh; the tarot coin and orchard magic are particular to this voice. The premise could verge on familiar “ghost saves beloved place,” but the sensory specificity and final reprise lift it above template.</comment>
