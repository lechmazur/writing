<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carpenter’s twenty-year silence and craft-driven interiority are vivid, embodied, and contradictory—fear colliding with the irrepressible need to sing. Micro-choices (examining the fragment, stepping through ivy) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final smile carries earned cost: voice reclaimed, but solitude intact. Missing only a sharper flaw that complicates the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of silence → fragment → oasis → song tightens stakes by density and cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—song reweights silence from absence to generative possibility, halo fragment dissolving into wind bell as felt cost. Spatial logic bends, but the pattern is taught early and paid off. One causal hiccup: door “never existed before” is asserted, not seeded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is selective, sensory, and purpose-driven: rusted train vs. eternal garden mirror inner decay/rebirth. Micro-setting (broken music box, wind bell) constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent; ivy wall breach is legible. Garden’s impossible fruits risk whimsy but serve the closure’s reconfiguration. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming voice—signaled early and tightened once through song’s risk. Escalation is textural: silence thickens until song fractures it. Cost is emotional exposure; no external antagonist needed. Agency is renunciation of muteness, not victory over foe. Could use one more tangible forfeiture to reach 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as generative possibility, not void. Subtext in gesture (touching fragment, first tentative note) avoids statement. Final image—wind bell left behind—reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: reclaimed voice still echoes in abandoned field. No thematic echo violations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in carpenter’s taciturn perception; syntax mirrors patient craft (“quietly persistent hands”). Compression and elision taught early (“misting hush” as both weather and metaphysic). No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm modulates with emotional crescendo. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, musical, and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern, not ornament. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “impossible colors”) fits lyric mode. One mixed metaphor—“canvas of possibility” vs. “symphony of rebirth”—barely grazes clarity. Closure line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—silent carpenter revives circus magic through song—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes (abandoned circus, magical object) are transformed by specificity of craft and silence. Risky spatial bending pays off in closure. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty. No derivative echoes.</comment>
