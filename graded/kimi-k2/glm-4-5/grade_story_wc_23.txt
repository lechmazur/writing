<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific—navigator’s scars, grafted skin, and the bronze censer foot as talisman all reveal character under pressure. Motivation to guide others through “geography of loss” is dramatized in the midnight call and the bridge-building choice. The final smile is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “raw solace” is named rather than shown once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the navigator’s “Welcome home” crystallizes the reverse migration’s stakes while the censer foot’s heat marks the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Starlit signal station, bronze censer foot, and gibbous moon are vivid, selective, and constrain choices—censer’s heat dictates channel-building tempo. Sensory hierarchy reflects navigator’s priorities: bronze hum, screen pulses, ship lights. Micro-setting (console, transmitter) functions as crucible. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding reverse migration—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the midnight call orders “Build the bridge between tides.” Agency is navigator’s configuration of signals; cost is the censer’s near-burning heat. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of return-as-redemption emerges from concrete particulars: censer foot, scars, midnight riddles. Final image of blinking ship lights offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in “raw solace” and “geography of loss” is felt, not stated. Resists tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—weathered, lyrical, tactile. Syntax mirrors navigator’s meticulous care: “fingers tracing the edges,” “silver thread.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Dialogue minimal but subtextual: “Build the bridge between tides.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful: “geography of loss,” “silver thread.” Sentence variety supports pressure. One mixed metaphor—“geography of loss became tangible, navigable terrain”—slightly blurs, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: maritime navigation + lunar alchemy + spiritual cartography. Reverse migration as literal and metaphysical return feels inevitable. Risk in lyric compression pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
