<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maven’s interiority—“home as a moving tapestry of connections”—is vivid and embodied, but the leap from passive wonder to world-reshaping agency reads more lyrical than causally earned; the moment where feather-texture unlocks corridors comes at readerly cost because no prior scene showed her micro-decisions narrowing to this singular trigger.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (CR): mountain dissolves into “doorway between all homes,” cost felt as prior alienation paid off. Causality is accumulative/textural—density increase via feather-guided texture—but late-third appearance of stone + feather reads more enchanted than causally seeded; small cohesion slip at final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is lavishly textured—leather air, skylights of silver, corridors that re-knit themselves—yet remains always at functional pressure. Feather texture becomes micro-setting, a conduit that physically shifts architecture; environment constrains choice and recharges final epiphany perfectly. Spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake voiced early: “shape of home.” Pressure deepens through nightly seeding rituals, culminating in decisive reconfiguration. One tightening visible, no reversals. Cost is emotional forfeiture—former alienation—but paid in image rather than scene-level sacrifice, keeping upper band entry just out of reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: home as relational ligature across time. No overt moralizing; final tableau reframes prior images (mirror, feather, corridor) into non-literal answer. Emotional aftereffect lingers—the promise that belonging is portable—achieved through concrete transformation, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lush, arc-consistent lyric texture—“paper and ink cosmos,” “light the color of heartbeats”—controlled under pressure. POV never wavers; perceptual signature is Maven’s synesthetic noticing. Micro-elliptical syntax teaches feather-as-reading practice early; rhythm modulates with emotional crescendo without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose propulsive and image-rich; occasional stacked metaphors (“heartbeat-shaped corridors,” “hidden thunder drumbeat”) flirt with purple excess but under emotional ceiling. Rhythm breathes naturally; no significant loops or filter stacks. Opening and closing lines echo to satisfying acoustic effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms familiar “magic library” and “wandering seer” tropes into textured, felt universe. Crucial twist: library is not sanctuary but porous portal network. Bold synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though risk of enchanted-over-causal remains. Fresh yet cohesive.</comment>
