<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—she “touches the lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth” and “feels connected”—but the decisive choice to row out and reflect light is more asserted than dramatized; the meeting with Jim retroactively motivates rather than pressures. Embodied emotion is present yet flattens into gentle nostalgia. The final nod is credible but the cost is diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s purpose crystallizes while refracted moonlight fills the alcove, the cost being the night-long labor and the inheritance of her grandmother’s vigil. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each reflection adds density until the scene glows. Orientation is clear by line 6. One minor slip: coincidence (Jim already there) complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity survives.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor, moonlit water, and alcove’s darkness are filtered through Mara’s need to “reflect light,” so setting constrains method and supplies the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful—liquid mercury, swaying masts—without cataloging. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from fire escape to rowboat to rock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carry light into literal and moral darkness—is signaled early. Pressure deepens as oil wanes and darkness thickens; Mara’s agency is the steady reflecting. Cost is the night’s exhaustion and the quiet acceptance of legacy. No reversal, but the single meaningful intensification suffices for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited caretaking emerges through the gauge tooth and refracted moonlight rather than statement. Subtext rests in the unspoken recognition between Mara and Jim. Final image reweights the rose’s “ending” into a quiet continuance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile detail—“planters bolted to metal stairs,” “liquid mercury.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise. Dialogue is minimal but natural. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains Mara’s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“liquid mercury”) serve rather than clutter. Final paragraph achieves quiet cadence without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The canal-lock heritage and light-reflection conceit feel fresh against the urban-harbor backdrop. The rose petal and gauge tooth avoid cliché by functioning as tools, not symbols. Slight risk in the coincidental meeting is balanced by earned resonance.</comment>
