<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Father Michael’s renunciation of the repair is earned by prior guilt and the letter in his pocket; the contradictory impulses (fix vs. forgive) play out in the shop’s silence. Embodied emotion is sparse but credible. Secondary pressure from Ms. Eleanor is light yet sufficient to tilt the choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the priest chooses not to repair the heart, foreclosing the path of personal absolution and accepting the cost of ongoing guilt. Causal chain (Grant’s gift → letter → house purchase → silence of heart) holds. One transition (street → shop) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique shop’s ticking hush and stained-glass light constrain the decision moment; the heart itself serves as micro-setting. Selective sensory detail supports mood without clutter. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to spend savings on repair or on restitution—tightens once when the priest realizes the heart’s silence is the answer. Agency is renunciation; cost is the unhealed heart he must keep carrying. No external coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the heart’s transformation from symbol of mending to symbol of unearned forgiveness. Subtext lives in the silent mechanism and the unopened letter. Final image (melodies in the street) offers resonant, non-moralizing after-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Father Michael’s perception; diction is restrained, ecclesiastical without sermonizing. Dialogue between priest and Eleanor is spare yet goal-driven. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly free of loops; occasional elevated phrasing (“vibrant hush”) is purposeful. One minor scaffold (“he realized what he must do”) could tighten. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The clockwork heart as penitential token feels fresh; the grafting of prison contrition onto music-box repair is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of Thomas Grant’s craft and the priest’s house purchase prevent template drift.</comment>
