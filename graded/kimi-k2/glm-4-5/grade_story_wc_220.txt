<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bloodhound's sensory gift and history are made concrete through embodied action—rubbing the wax leaf, noticing prism-split words in grooves—rather than told. Each micro-choice (packing, redirecting toward the valley, holding the second leaf) stems from a coherent interior contradiction: duty to the dead vs. hunger for living reunion. Cost appears in the final beat: "once used his senses to find the dead; now they had led him to new life"—a renunciation of past identity priced in the image itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Achieves Accumulative/Textural lens closure: an earned tonal reconfiguration where distance becomes closeness not by literal compression but by shared epistemic key. Each shard (first cylinder, second cylinder, twin leaves) deepens pattern density until the very last line reweights earlier salvage into living garden. Causality remains intact while operating on pattern and revealed light; cost is the abandonment of eastward route and old self-concept.</question>

<comment>The settlement’s “mechanical breathing,” the phonograph grooves as readable terrain, and the twin leaves are sensory anchors that directly constrain tactics—the leaf is literally repurposed as lens to read coordinates. Micro-setting of hidden valley crops under fallen drone ribs crystallizes scale shift. These places are not backdrop but tools and barriers felt by paws, eyes, and memory.</question>

<comment>Dominant stake—translate distance into emotional closeness—tightens via each tinted revelation. Each new shard of information forecloses false eastward march and narrows path northeast; final image makes price explicit (abandoning former identity). No reversals needed; cumulative narrowing under Accumulative lens suffices.</question>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from pattern rather than lecture: knowledge as intimacy, home as shared hermeneutics. The twin leaves refracting one message across years makes theme tangible without statement. Final conceptual repricing—“home is not a place, but a truth shared”—is embedded in the image of two held-together leaves rather than declared, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, weather-worn, perceptually specific: “subtle color changes of buried flesh,” “light refracted differently across each ridge.” Syntax compresses under pressure (“bloodhound eyes...now noticed”), mirroring tracker concentration. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays locked to Silas, culminating in the final single-sentence crystallization. Experimental elision (groove-to-text) is taught early and paid off.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Clean line-level craft: every sentence pulls double duty (characterization + causality or atmosphere + constraint). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphor. Information density high—“he adjusted his course” compresses days of revised compass reading into three words without loss of propulsion. Final image line tightens further to cadence beat matching the character’s exhale.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>A familiar “post-war journey to lost Eden” premise is transformed through the bloodhound’s specific synesthetic method—reading coordinates via wax-filtered light. Salvage-world mechanics feel new because tools (phonograph cylinder as cipher-map) arise from character sense rather than genre checklist. Risky formal compression succeeds; closure image feels earned rather than imposed.</question>
