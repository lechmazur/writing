<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya’s somatic-marker coping mechanism is embodied and specific; the photograph ritual and pearl-of-stillness concept anchor her contradictory impulses. The final release of the photo earns renunciation with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, though “diagnostic label-speak” in “somatic markers” and “freeze-frame” slightly blurs embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each return to the photograph and the children’s request tightens the pattern until the final release reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as the photo vanishes. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Arboretum and cliffside are vivid, salty, tactile; the oyster shell micro-setting constrains the pearl metaphor that charges closure. Selective sensory detail mirrors Maya’s narrowed focus under stress. Spatial choreography remains coherent; weather and tide affect the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to carry memory without being consumed—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: teaching the children forces Maya to externalize her method, leading to the final release. Cost is visible in the photograph’s loss and her outstretched stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory and loss can coexist without denial or despair. Subtext operates in the photograph’s journey from talisman to relinquished object. Final image offers non-literal answer—stillness amid churning sea—without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Maya’s perceptual filter; diction is calm, horticultural, slightly lyrical. Rhythm modulates with stress: shorter clauses during somatic spikes, longer breaths in stillness. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful (oyster shell, pearl). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: PTSD coping recast as botanical grafting and pearl formation. Children’s request reframes private ritual into teachable stance. Specificity of salty arboretum and oyster shell grounds the concept; no stock tropes.</comment>
