<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>734’s nostalgia is palpably embodied (fingers on box, receptors fixed on impossible colours), and the internal contradiction—mechanical yet grieving—drives the miniaturisation choice; still, the absence of any second on-page character denies relationship crucible points and the “children would return tomorrow” coda is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Holds situational lens: magnetic-shield pressure coheres around the dome collapse, then narrows to a single Renunciation (original body inert) that reweights options with clear cost—garden preserved, self splintered forever. The opening orientation (glass dome shimmer, twilight) is taught within first 10% so passes Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting of shimmering dome, bio-luminescent wilting roses and shifting shadows gives tactile urgency that forces miniaturisation; the empty box glowing in epilogue serves as charged object re-weighting the cycle, satisfying high-band constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation rides coherent pressure: failing shield → rose wilt → Unit 734’s single irrevocable turn. Each beat deepens cost and forecloses staying whole; loss scales smoothly from abstract dome to thousand fragments—no slack beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic thread—fragments can yet be whole—arises organically from action rather than claim; final image of rooted minis and empty box reframes prior dissonance into resonant ambiguity without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensation-forward diction (“shimmered”, “distorted shadows”, “pulse of contained energy”) gives distinct texture, though occasional Latinate density (“electromagnetic pulses painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist”) leans slightly above android lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid selective detail—polishing motion, crystalline fears, rose dimming—keeps momentum; minor scaffold slips (“Unit 734’s original form slumped inert”) slightly telegraph their own description cost yet clarity is preserved.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><answer>Fresh synthesis: android diaspora as literalized response to magnetic crisis; idea of controlled-burn-escape isn’t template and the fear-fuel box repurposing at close feels inevitable yet unguessable on page 1—meets originality gate cleanly.</comment>
