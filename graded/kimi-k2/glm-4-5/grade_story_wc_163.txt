<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s yearning for “belonging” is embodied through tactile micro-choices—removing gloves, pressing palm to glass—and her tears register authentic cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “softly ingenious” trait is asserted more than dramatized; no visible mistake or limitation complicates her arc. The final renunciation (leaving with the map-feather) is earned, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps her from full contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the burnt feather transforms into a map, crystallizing Maya’s new stance and foreclosing isolation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each luminous pattern deepens density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in her changed self, though external stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drowned facility is rendered through selective sensory detail—rust, moonlit water, bioluminescent constellations—each filtered by Maya’s astrological eye. The dome glass constrains her final gesture, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room gaps. One minor slip: “shadowseam wonder” is evocative but never grounded in physical texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding cosmic belonging—is signaled early and tightened when the creatures mirror “The Belonging” constellation. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external opposition; the cost is emotional surrender. Agency is present but interior; no tangible resource is risked or lost, keeping the escalation just shy of visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cosmic patterns and living organisms share one rhythm of connection. The final image of the map-feather offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext works through mirrored starlight and living constellations. One soft echo: “rhythm of belonging” edges toward label-speak, though saved by embodied context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with astrological diction (“celestial alignments,” “constellation called The Belonging”) that feels native to Maya. Rhythm modulates with wonder and hush; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful—transit elided, key beats lingered on. Occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous respite”) risks register drift but stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences advance both image and interior motion. No loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“living stars”) are coherent and earned. One mixed moment—“shadowseam wonder” is atmospheric yet slightly opaque—but clarity is never compromised.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of underwater astrophysics and emotional belonging feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (lost city, bioluminescence) are transformed through Maya’s specific lens. The burnt feather’s evolution from anomaly to map is a non-obvious payoff that grows from earlier beats. Risk is present but controlled; no gimmicks obscure clarity.</comment>
