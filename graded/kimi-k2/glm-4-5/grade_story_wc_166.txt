<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation—to preserve memory against the ban—remains consistent, and her final anchoring is an earned renunciation. Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstraction (“cosmic verse on mortal skin”). The transformation is credible, yet the cost (immobility) is stated more than felt. Character reads as archetype rather than individual; specificity of voice and contradiction are limited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira crystallizes into a living manuscript, the cost visible in her rooted stillness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of gaps, moonstone, inscription. Transitions are smooth; no orientation debt. One minor causality slip: the moonstone’s dissolve feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garden is evoked with selective sensory strokes (“forbidden beauty,” “scents that evoked a world before the ban”). Micro-setting (moonstone speck) constrains the final act. Spatial anchors are clear; twilight timing supports tone. Could use one tactile detail to ground the anchoring moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of memory—escalates through the act of inscription. One tightening beat: anchoring forecloses escape. Cost is legible (loss of mobility) but could be sharper on the page. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. forgetting emerges through image and action, never sermon. Final tableau of starlit manuscript reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the moonstone’s pulse and the garden’s forbidden scents deepens resonance. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and aligned with tide-dancer POV. Syntax flows like water, then crystallizes in the final stillness. No dialogue to test. Occasional elevated diction (“obsidian grace,” “cosmic verse”) skirts purple but stays within stylized register. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; figurative language mostly purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“her dance complete yet eternal”) slightly dulls final cadence. No mixed metaphors or scaffold. High information density; every sentence advances image or theme. Minor filter-verb haze in two spots.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-dancer turned living manuscript in a post-ban garden. Nostalgia ban and gap-observation method feel non-generic. Moonstone speck and anchoring are specific inventions that charge closure. Risky lyric mode pays off. Avoids stock dystopia tropes through sensory specificity.</comment>
