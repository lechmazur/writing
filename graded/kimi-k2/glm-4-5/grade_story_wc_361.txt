<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ayla’s jittery interiority is embodied in tactile gestures (touching the pendant, adjusting her pack) and evolves into quiet confidence; the mentor’s absence functions as an off-page pressure that shapes her choices. However, the shift from courier to “deliverer of wonder” is asserted more than dramatized, softening the earned-cost threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pendant’s hand-off to the elder crystallizes Ayla’s renunciation of courier identity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image—“ground trembled…remembered”—reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway and village valley are filtered through Ayla’s urgency; the pendant’s shimmer against the lights and shoots through snow constrain her path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver the pendant before solstice—tightens once when the shortcut is revealed via extended encounter. The cost is felt in Ayla’s relinquishment of the artifact and identity, but the escalation is more lyrical than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder germinating in routine emerges through concrete events (extended encounter, shoots in snow) rather than statement. Final image of earth “remembering” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Ayla’s perceptual signature—“jittery relic courier,” “aurora-lit ridgeway”—with rhythmic variation. No head-hopping; compression (“Wonder grows…”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional lyrical clusters (“ethereal blue and green lights casting dancing shadows”) verge on overwriting without pattern-teaching. No loops or scaffold in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant’s encounter-extension mechanic feels fresh, synthesized through Ayla’s embodied experience rather than exposition. The transformation of courier into wonder-awakener is specific to this voice and world.</comment>
