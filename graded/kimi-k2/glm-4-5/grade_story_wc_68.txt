<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo’s interiority is vivid and consistent, but the “abrasive calm” trait is asserted more than embodied; the final choice to preserve the cog is legible yet feels slightly pre-announced rather than earned under fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to preserve knowledge reweights the premise with felt cost. Causality is intact, though the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught late; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sewer tunnels and submerged ruins are rendered with tactile specificity; the chronometer cog functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. A few generic “gleaming spires” phrases keep it from 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory vs. mandated forgetting—is signaled early and tightens once when the cog forces Milo’s stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Milo’s cataloguing and the Council’s erasure; the ending’s quiet refusal resonates without moralizing. A touch of abstract “wisdom” talk near the end slightly blunts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, cerebral, and consistent; free indirect style stays clean. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moments) edges outside Milo’s probable lexicon, keeping it below 8.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly crisp, but repetitive sentence stems (“sedimentary layers,” “competing narratives”) and near-paraphrase loops dull momentum. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The submerged post-plague archive-philosopher premise feels fresh; the chronometer cog as memory talisman avoids cliché. Risk is moderate—quiet rebellion rather than spectacle—but transformation is evident.</comment>
