<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clean-slate seeker’s interiority is vivid (“weight of my dirty past pressed down like water in my chest”), but the moment of meeting his younger self flattens into summary rather than embodied contradiction; the looped identity never collides with present stakes in a way that forces a new micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal loop lands cleanly—signing the ball completes the circuit and re-weights the premise—but the newspaper cluework is off-stage; the coordinates arrive pre-decoded, so the protagonist’s agency feels managed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake and cavern tunnels are sharply etched (“shattered mirrors” of reflected algae) and the baseball’s warmth against the cold stone constrains the final tunnel choice; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will empathy survive the loop?—is signaled early and tightened when the protagonist must sign the ball knowing it will erase another self; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the recursive image of the signed baseball: memory as both wound and gift. The final image reframes the entire cycle without moralizing, though a touch of explanatory gloss (“teach them again”) slightly dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is consistent, with lyrical compression (“jaded wonder washed over me”) that matches the cavern’s glow; no head-hop, and diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon even under metaphysical stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic, but occasional stacked modifiers (“delicately robust baseball”) flirt with overwriting; no loops or scaffold, and the final paragraph’s cadence lands with earned poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The time-loop empathy engine feels fresh, synthesizing familiar tropes through the tactile baseball and recursive newspaper clues; the risk of sentimentality is skirted by the protagonist’s quiet renunciation of linear identity.</comment>
