<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—scaled fingers on spines, pendant’s pulse against the chest—but the “dimensionally homesick” label is repeated rather than dramatized. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the guardian’s translucent edges and renunciation of place. Micro-choices (absorbing the pendant’s energy, stepping forward) align with the long-honed discipline of waiting. Still, the homesickness trait never complicates a present decision, keeping it just shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of light-bending, mist oscillations, and interiorized memories tighten until the boundary dissolves. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—guardian becomes “belonging everywhere and nowhere” with visible cost (translucence, abandonment of the garden). Causality holds: centuries of practice in interiorizing exteriors directly enables the final porous state. One minor drift: the cultist backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, but it does not rupture the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen roses shifting from white to indigo, light flowing in “currents,” and the weathered cherub create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the final choice—garden itself is left behind. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The boundary of light evolves from static backdrop to navigable medium, charging the closure image. No orientation debt; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform exile into belonging. Escalation is textural—pendant’s warming, roses’ color shift, mist thickening—culminating in the porous boundary that forces the guardian’s stance crystallization. Cost is legible: loss of fixed identity and place. Agency is active (drawing energy, stepping forward) rather than passive waiting. Could edge higher if the homesickness itself exacted an additional on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: uncertainty as the only constant, home as consciousness. No explicit moralizing; the final image of the garden as “another page” reweights prior exile without statement. Subtext operates in the pendant’s hum and the cherub’s ambiguous smile. The piece invites counter-readings—has the guardian transcended or merely displaced exile?—with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “foggy lucidity,” “liquid starlight,” “playground of possibility.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments at the porous climax. Perceptual signature is consistent: the guardian notices via texture, temperature, and refracted light. No POV leakage or register drift. Experimental compression (“dimensionally homesick”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—light as tide, garden as page—and never muddle causality. Minor scaffold: “the guardian realized with foggy lucidity” could be tighter, but it does not stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise fuses feral librarian, dimensional exile, and sentient light boundaries into a fresh synthesis. The “interiorizing exteriors” method transforms a survival trick into metaphysical transcendence. Risky lyric mode sustains coherence and heightens stakes. No close echoes; the cosmic-library trope is reconfigured through embodied specificity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
