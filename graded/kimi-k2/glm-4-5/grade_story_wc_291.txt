<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's face-blind condition is shown through her tactile method and memory of shapes, but interiority remains mostly summary; the final choice to accuse the assistant is stated rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear—ribbon → mask → guest list → assistant—but the decisive change (confession) happens off-page, softening closure; orientation is sound, lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Quarry’s mist and granite texture are vividly filtered through Elena’s tactile POV; the ribbon fragment serves as micro-setting that constrains her reconstruction and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—solve the cold case—is signaled early; pressure tightens as ribbon analysis narrows suspects, but the final narrowing to the assistant feels compressed and the cost is not dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of awakening dormant empathy emerges through Elena’s reconstruction of forgotten violence; final line states rather than dramatizes the reweighting, though the quarry’s lifting mist offers quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elena’s tactile perception; prose is controlled, with occasional elevated diction (“lance through what others could not see”) that slightly overshoots her register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, but two paraphrase loops (“furrowed hush” repeated, “methodical approach” restated) and one mixed metaphor (“lance through… hush”) dull the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Face-blind portraitist solving a mask murder via tactile evidence is a fresh synthesis; risk is moderate but stakes feel specific to this quarry and this ribbon.</comment>
