<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storyteller’s singular motive—translate texture into sound—shapes every micro-choice: rising at dawn, reading birds’ flights, caressing old fabrics, guiding the diamond to resonance. Copper-veined embodiment ties craft to flesh; contradictions (frailty vs fervor) are lived rather than narrated. The final stance crystallizes as earned endurance: he quietly accepts his twilight completion with tears that pay the cost of a lifetime’s strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure unit: the diamond hums an entire sentence, turning decades of pattern-translation into audible texture. The causal lattice holds—each step (reading birds → hand gesture → diamond pulse → echo amplification) links because/therefore. Time-span compression from youth to old age is legible in the 800-word window and deepens the cost (aging body, last speaker gone). No causal breaks or teleporting props.</comment>

<comment>Bone towers and canyon wind are not mere backdrop; they amplify and cradle the diamond’s hum. The micro-setting of the tunnel of echoes literally channels every sound and choice. Palette and acoustics shape what the storyteller can attempt at climax; texture is integral to outcome, justifying high band. Slight dip for occasional lush sentences but no loss of momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preventing total language extinction—intensifies with the death of the last native speaker and the tightening of time. One deepening suffices: the irreplaceable bird pattern he has never seen, compelling a final ritual. Stakes land as visceral ache, not abstraction. Cost rendered on the page: weeping and skin’s deepening grooves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of tactile knowledge and sonic preservation—the limits of skin and the expanse of echo. The final tonal hum offers non-verbal proof of theme without moral statement; complexity lingers because the newly audible sentence is untranslatable to the reader. Thematic question receives a resonant, non-literal answer: “bridge between worlds of sensation and sound.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare yet charged, lyrical cadence modulating with bird-patterned syntax reflecting the motif it translates. Perceptual signature is consistent across POV; external description and interior pulse share a copper-lit diction. Prose breathes through long, echoing sentences then tightens into percussion for the breakthrough moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Each sentence carries multiple functions—image, acoustics, tactility—without metaphor muddle. Rhythm accelerates or slows to match beats of flight capture and tunnel recording. Occasional stacked epithets (“pale light that filtered through the bone towers”) flirt with purple but remain functional. Few loops; scaffolding is tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh, non-precious integration of a dying language, copper-veined biology, and acoustic geology. Core premise (recording tactile glyphs as sound via bird choreography and flawed diamond) feels inevitable in hindsight, high-risk yet coherent. No familiar templates; transformation stands.</question>
