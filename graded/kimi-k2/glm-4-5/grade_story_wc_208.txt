<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is textured (“spirited,” “perpetually learning”) and her final renunciation of the GPS carries cost, but the slide’s agency overshadows hers; her contradictory impulses are asserted rather than dramatized mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the slide’s visions tighten the pattern until the sculpture crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift, closure is legible, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Storm-tossed archway and turbine-hum are vivid, selective, and ultimately charge the final sculpture; the setting constrains her movements and rhythm, though the offshore farm remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—artistic legacy versus personal disorientation—tightens once when visions force a reimagining. The deepening is clear, but the price (dead GPS renounced) feels external rather than extracted from her body.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of timewoven alliances emerges organically from the slide’s visions and the sculpture’s spiral; final image reweights prior material without moralizing. A touch of grandiloquence (“testament to timewoven alliances”) slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic control and perceptual signature (“turbine-hum reverie”). Occasional elevated diction (“scaffold complexity with simplicity”) nudges register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; minor loops (“spirited driftwood sculptor” twice, “turbine-hum reverie” repeated) and one mixed metaphor (“scaffold complexity with simplicity”) keep it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar portal-vision trope is refreshed by the wind-farm soundscape and driftwood sculpture; the synthesis feels specific to Elena’s craft. Risk is moderate, but the charged final image justifies the frame.</comment>
