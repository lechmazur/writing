<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the archivist’s contradictory impulses—clinging to analog craft while accepting obsolescence—play out in micro-choices (mixing inks, sealing the vial). The final renunciation is earned and carries felt cost. Minor drift into abstract self-diagnosis (“haunted euphoria”) slightly blurs immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer and ritual beat tightens the stake of irreversible loss. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sealed vial and turned back crystallize the cost without tidy resolution. No causality breaks; orientation is swift and functional.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty is more than backdrop; its flowers literally supply the restorative powders, binding setting to action. Twilight’s fade mirrors the archive’s end, charging the final image. Spatial anchors are vivid and consistent; one minor over-description of petals drifts toward ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—loss of analog purpose—is signaled early and escalates through each preparatory beat. The act of sealing the vial is the decisive tightening that forecloses any return. Cost is visible and felt; no external coincidence intrudes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory’s fragility emerges organically from the archivist’s ritual and the locket’s warmth. Final line reweights the entire sequence without moralizing. Subtext in the “regenerated covenant” phrase deepens on reflection, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through the archivist’s trained eye. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure—longer cadences in calm beats, clipped fragments at the end. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, and memory without redundancy. One minor paraphrase loop (“small moments” twice in two lines) is the only blemish. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise of obsolescence is transformed through the specificity of walnut-ink chemistry and the jetty’s living archive. The regenerated covenant feels fresh, not gimmicky. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
