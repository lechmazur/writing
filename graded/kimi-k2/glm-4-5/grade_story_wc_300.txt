<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inspector emerges quickly through sensory skepticism; her micro-choice to descend the unmapped passage crystallizes curiosity and propels the narrative. Internal contradiction—bunker scorn vs. compassionate mission—plays under stress and guides the climax. Final stance crystallizes with earned cost in the caves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: pearl-stasis crystallizes new mission beyond bunkers, with invisible crown as legible cost. Causal ‘because/therefore’ chain—discovery→confession absorption→light spread—holds under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves provide spatial choreography that alters choices—cool luminous body pressure—and restrains action; specificity anchors theme without expository drift. Micro-setting (body/specific object too) supports stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake teardown of isolation versus suffocating hush escalates through pearl absorption of hopes. Two causal turns: descent narrows option; confession flow tightens choice and forces renunciation of inspector role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes emerge from abandoned hope→renewal cycle without overt moralizing; final crown image reweights prior bunkers to relics. Conceptual repricing (CR) with invisible radiance as social cost for reader is legible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct third-person limited voice tracks inspector’s shifting awe and authoritativeness; compression and clean rhythmic control under pressure. No cliché ruminations, and pearls’ glimmer stays character-filtered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Clean lyric compression with high information density, propulsive rhythm under pressure. Zero figurative muddle; “crown of living light” precision lands without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of bunkers vs. hope through pearl as biological charge is fresh non-obvious synthesis. Crystal caves & seashell confessions add idiosyncratic cultural inflection without gimmickry.</comment>
