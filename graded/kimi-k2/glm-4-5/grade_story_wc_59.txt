<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elorian’s yearning is vivid and embodied, but the interiority drifts into abstract “hypothesizing” rather than concrete contradiction under pressure; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost feels more stated than viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—beauty cannot be assembled—yet the lens tilts late from causal to accumulative; the palace’s reversion is legible but the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The suspended palace and stalactites are evoked with tactile specificity; the egg’s glow and the softening stone constrain the climax, but the broader world rules remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore beauty—is clear and tightens when the device fails; the price is the egg’s fading light, though the escalation is more accumulative than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the failed resurrection of beauty; the final image of the faintly glowing egg reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature that favors shimmer and mechanism; occasional elevated diction edges toward the poetic but stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Prose is fluid and image-rich, yet a few stacked metaphors (“stone teeth,” “mechanical world of gears and pistons”) risk overwriting; no loops or scaffolds mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>The fusion of extinct-bird resurrection with steampunk elegy feels fresh; the premise is familiar but transformed through Elorian’s specific failure and the egg’s irreplaceable glow.</comment>
