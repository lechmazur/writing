<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Galen’s interiority is consistent—withdrawal, quest, awe—but emotions remain more described (“shivering bliss”) than embodied. The arc of refusal-return is legible, yet the micro-choice to stay feels stated rather than agonized. Earned, but cost registers late and lightly for one scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Selects Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, dreamtime tempo, and final CR of re-seeing the world. Orientation anchors quickly; transition to “multiple realities overlapping” functions as closure. Feels a beat long—but the repricing of perception after “he would finally return” pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse, night-shade glass, ringing crystal fruit do more than flavor: they supply tools (fruit, diagrams) and isolate risk. Spatial anchors stay coherent under surreal overlay—the setting actively narrows choices rather than merely decorating them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Primary stake—“shape of possibility” sought and glimpsed—remains singular and tight. Pressure rises not through adversary but by escalating sensual cost: cold-light disorientation, unsnapped boundaries. Final choice crystallizes: he must leave changed or remain lost; foreclosed options feel tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of perception and abandonment surfaces obliquely through images of puppetry, twilight, crystalline fruit. It avoids overt moral but does lean on explanatory coda (“understood now why he had withdrawn”). Still, the final image of “keeper of the spaces between realities” resonates without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Voice leans lush—perhaps one metaphor too many per paragraph (“shivered like tiny spirits”)—yet stays under Galen’s scholarly awe. Rhythm modulates with wonder; syntax never stalls action. Registers distinctly medieval-arcane without costume-showiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences mostly propulsive and varied; occasional soft filters (“there was a sound like”) but never obscure. No loops or scaffold; precision where needed (“phosphorescent vines,” “anatomical limitations”). A few elevated coinages skirt purple but stay functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Old motifs—knight-retreat, enchanted greenhouse, multiverse glimpse—feel reshuffled into fresh sensory logic. The marionette program as mystical cosmogram offers original hinge, and the inversion of “abandonment not from cowardice” adds earned wrinkle. Transformation stays specific to this voice.</comment>
