<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the shift from mystery to revelation is more narrated than dramatized through micro-choice. The final stance crystallizes, yet the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonlit glass reweights the stake with quiet conceptual cost. Causality is loose—travel and caretaker access are lightly sketched—but the final image reconfigures meaning without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral glass, and seasonal shift are selective and atmospheric; the etched window constrains perception and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the transition from studio to cathedral is compressed.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens through the glass revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the postcard redirects the quest, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of moonlight, glass, and bloom; the final image reframes the mystery without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence, though the epiphany edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific; the diction of “umbral tenderness” and “dawning hush” modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue appears; internal texture remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; rhythm varies, and figurative language is purposeful. Occasional stacked modifiers (“tender, umbral beauty”) flirt with excess but do not obscure clarity or stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of botany, glasswork, and lunar perception feels fresh; the cathedral-window twist reframes the generational question. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds.</comment>
