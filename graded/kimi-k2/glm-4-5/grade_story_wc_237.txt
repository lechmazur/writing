<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s crystallization affliction and rune-scholar vocation are vividly embodied; the micro-choice to whisper her grandmother’s charm halts the physical crisis and crystallizes her stance. Interior contradiction—fear of failure vs. desire to help—drives every beat. The earned cost is the irreversible shedding of the quill tip, sealing her renunciation of further attempts on her own scars. Only a slight excess of reflective summary keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene anchored by 40 words; causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Each rune stroke tightens density until the final image reweights the stakes: scars become cautionary stories, quill tip falls—visible cost. No teleporting props or causal breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock, moss, ink, tea steam, and the quill itself form a micro-setting that constrains posture, timing, and tool use. The platform’s tilt directly triggers the crystallization crisis; the shed memory scent anchors reflection without stalling momentum. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform personal scars into living warnings—signaled early. Pressure escalates via the approaching storm and internal crystallization risk; the final rune completion forecloses the option to keep her own pain private. Cost is the quill’s spent tip and permanent bodily record.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of alchemizing private pain into communal wisdom emerges through the rune act itself, never stated. The grandmother’s charm reprises as both comfort and tool, reweighted in the final breath-held silence. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the crystal cylinder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—luminescent ink “like living creature,” steam “miniature dragons.” Rhythm compresses under stress (“Panic surged… crystallization beginning”) then exhales with lyrical cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence layers image and consequence. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors or loops. The final paragraph’s syntactic slowing mirrors the held breath, then releases with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of magical inscription is refreshed through the crystallization curse and grandmother’s garden-shed superstition. The fusion of memory, body, and rune craft feels inevitable; the quill’s self-shedding tip is a non-obvious yet earned closure device.</comment>
