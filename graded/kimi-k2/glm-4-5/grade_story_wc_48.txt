<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; no concrete micro-choice alters the present beat. The “conflicted” label is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory action. Final peace feels asserted, not earned by visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: the seashell placed on the page crystallizes meaning. Yet the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught late; pattern of mist/motif repetition is not anchored early enough to guide reader. Causality between reflection and final gesture remains implied rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mist, ruins, and seashell are vividly rendered and filter through the novelist’s perceptual bias. Setting does not actively constrain choice, but the fragment’s glimmer in final light recharges earlier imagery, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to maintain artistic vision against market pressure”—is named but never tested in scene; no external or internal obstacle escalates. Tension is atmospheric, not causal. No visible cost is extracted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of art versus commerce is coherent yet abstract; it emerges through motif (spiral, mist) rather than dramatized conflict. Final image of fragment on manuscript offers quiet resonance without moralizing, satisfying the non-literal reweighting test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific. Syntax mirrors the novelist’s ruminative cadence; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“solemnize the culmination”) slightly strains plausibility under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and information-dense; figurative language occasionally stacks (“swirling hush,” “feral nexus”) but remains legible. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; final paragraph lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of writer seeking closure in mystical grove risks cliché, yet the spiral seashell as both muse and final seal feels specific. Risk is moderate; transformation of familiar material is more lyrical than structural.</comment>
