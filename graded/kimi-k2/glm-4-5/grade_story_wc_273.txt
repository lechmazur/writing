<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The albino tracker’s childhood drive is clear, embodied fear of slowed time, and interiority shows contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices (projecting the drone, stepping into ink) align with the central stake. A credible renunciation—acceptance of temporal flux—earns change with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: eclipse end triggers ink experiment → temporal disappearance reframes knowledge. Closure in Charged Poise articulates cost (bound to time’s fabric). One meaningful tightening sorts escalation via ink pattern mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Wind-carved shelters magnify temporal anomalies; micro-setting (ink on stone slab) alters disappearance vector. Specific, embodied detail grounds speculative premise. Rocks constrain drone pathing at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—unlocking temporal distortion—escalates via ink mechanics and eclipse aftermath. Tracker’s agency narrows options; disappearance forecloses safe return path. Cost: potential lost to time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through obsession with crisis-time, realized in mirror-shifting ink. Subtext in serene anger → wisdom through embodied cost. Ending image reweights premise: “We change our relationship to time” with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: visual-albinism bias, tracker’s precise sensory priorities. Rhythm modulates under disappearance pressure. No head-hop; interiority stays POV-bound, voice coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>High information density, clean propulsion, no scaffolds. Figurative language purposeful in ink-geometries. Read-aloud rhythm tight under final beat charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Temporal displacement via ink patterns reweights familiar crisis-time trope. Non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable. Earned risk: stepping into ink transforms both body and perception without mercy.</comment>
