<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—the yearning vs. rulership burden—drives every beat and final renunciation, but two “weight lifting from shoulders” glitches are stock filler.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal dream-path → physical climb → cobalt vision → starlight revelation tightens options cleanly; closure lands with an earned Resonant Reconfiguration and visible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Early, vivid anchoring of “maiden-voice moon” and razor rocks; ember constrains final standpoint, though one “lacy menace” phrase tilts decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Bleeding starlight heights escalation by making the choice to embrace or resist cosmic burden, with cost traced to the altered reflection in the pool.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Royal cage vs. ancient magic framed through concrete particulars; the boundary between duty and self is reopened rather than solved, avoiding moral didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyre-like interiority and controlled rhythmic uplift; compression in the final stanza charges closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dense, propulsive sentences; no loops until two “gilded cage” verb repeats—minor scaffold penalty—yet clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Familiar magical ridge trope refreshed by disenchanted royal POV and cost-bound starlight; late choral Maera feels under-personalized but doesn’t diminish overall freshness.</comment>
