<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prophet’s interiority—especially the paradox of “precognitive forgetting”—is embodied in tactile gestures (chalk, driftwood) that force micro-choices under fog. Flaw: the climactic “add a final spiral” action feels externally narrated rather than a last-ditch re-weighting driven by the foretold amnesia.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens sustained; each driftwood marker gathers and then releases a future-memory into fog, tightening stakes through density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the hum is located but will be forgotten, achieving Earned Stasis with audible cost captured on the page (“soft, patient, and profound”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Garden and fog act as mutable geography that hides/reveals props (arch, tapes driftwood), directly constraining every placement and search vector. Condensation on the arch and tape hiss provide multisensory anchors without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>One clear dominant stake: locate-and-keep a sound memory before it’s erased. Pressure intensifies steadily as options narrow to the chalk-drawing climax; the caretaker arrival adds external pressure that validates the quest rather than resolving it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the inevitable slip of memory—emerges from action (each mark erodes) rather than assertion. Final hum is the non-literal answer that reweights all earlier tape voices and forgotten echoes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Liquid, slowed syntax mirrors the prophet’s hush and fog-dulled perception. Driftwood placement rhythm (“With each placement…”) teaches the reader to expect accretive loops that payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Clean ear with only minor redundancy (“remember remembering” echo twice) and no obstructive loops. Precision in sensory descriptors (“shimmering with condensation”) delivers density without spill.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: the idea that a sound can age like moss, captured in a metal sculpture, is an inventive re-purposing of memory-art concepts. Risk is moderate; accretive structure justifies lyric disorientation.</comment>
