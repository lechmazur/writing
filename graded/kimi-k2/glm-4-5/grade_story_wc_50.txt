<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s reflective nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tracing gears, mapping light angles—yet her interiority stays concrete; the final renunciation of immediate gratification for long-term echo-storage is earned and carries visible cost in her sustained solitude and labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s awakening reweights the entire cavern into a living archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflection pattern tightens the density until the final thrumming beat crystallizes the cost of endless custodianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its veins and angles literally calibrate the mechanism. Light on stone constrains every adjustment Elara makes, and the final swirl of reflections charges the closing image with earned wonder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve communal memory—tightens through daily mapping of shifting light; each measurement forecloses leisure and deepens the solitary cost. One clear intensification: the cavern warms under her attention, signaling the irreversible fusion of keeper and archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory’s survival demands sacrifice of present comfort. The final image of “wonder stored where reason could keep it safe” reweights every prior scene of patient labor without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, mirroring a locksmith’s tactile mind; perceptual signature filters every description through angles, gears, and faint clicks. Rhythm modulates from meditative long sentences to the staccato of the timer’s first click, tightening with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“wonder in the cellar of reason”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances either mechanism detail or emotional charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The conceit of harvesting echoes via reflected light angles feels fresh and inevitable; the locksmith’s craft is transmuted into metaphysical repair. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant final image, transforming a familiar “save the culture” trope into intimate, tactile myth.</comment>
