<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli’s pacifism and inherited sorrow are embodied in micro-choices—detaching the crystal, steadying hands, tears that mirror ancestral salt—yet interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “profound longing” rather than concrete contradiction. The gravitational lightness is dramatized as both enabler and gauge of hope, fulfilling the 9+ test of embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final stitch opens the locked dimension with undeniable conceptual cost—the dissolution of the ship and Eli’s bodily departure. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each meditation session and tear-tracked photograph tightens the pattern until the cadence shift in the last paragraph reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The recycled ship’s groaning panels and ghost-haunted corridors constrain every move; the meditation chamber’s temporal rift is anchored through tactile detail (“quantum energies pulsed”). The shimmer of dried tears on photographs functions as micro-setting that guides the stitching, charging the final image when the ship dissolves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension or remain the last lonely human—tightens through each stitch; one wrong move could collapse the bridge. Agency is continuous: Eli’s renunciation of violence and embrace of compassion drive every escalation, with the visible price of irreversible bodily departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of compassion as humanity’s true legacy emerges organically from Eli’s choices and the crystalline tear’s reweighting at closure. No moralizing; the final image of weightless crossing reconfigures meaning without statement, achieving resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during stitching and breathes in the final drift. Perceptual signature—“spectral ghost of Earth,” “haunting silence”—remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous understanding”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor (“flower after endless winter”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes post-human transcendence, Buddhist compassion artifact, and gravitational emotion into a fresh, inevitable arc. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration; no derivative echoes.</comment>
