<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but generic; “insatiably creative” is asserted rather than embodied. The final renunciation—giving pieces of herself—lands as a felt cost, yet the contradiction between surrender and control remains abstract. Micro-choices are present but lack specificity to this pruner alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of wonder builds until the seed’s rainbow reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—“to save something precious, one must sometimes give pieces of oneself.” Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Verdant parapet and waterfall are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the pruner’s pulse. The transformed seed casting rainbow on moss constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: surrendering part of herself to charge the seed. Cost is legible on page; pressure deepens through pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-through-surrender emerges from concrete action, not statement. Final image of the seed waiting “between worlds” offers non-literal resonance. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific—“leaves above held their breath.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional soft loops (“the pruner began her method by capturing essence…”) but none obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent; no mixed metaphors at peak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar motif of artist-mystic is refreshed through tactile seed-weaving and color-preservation conceit. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk lies in lyrical density, not gimmickry. Specificity of orchard craft and waterfall energy grounds the fantastical.</comment>
