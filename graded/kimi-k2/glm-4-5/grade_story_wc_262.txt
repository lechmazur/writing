<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is vivid—her spatial imagination and psychometry are embodied in tactile handling of film—but the “unused love” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat. Micro-choices (threading the film, tracing sprocket holes) align with motive, yet the climactic promise to “give you voice again” feels slightly unearned because prior stakes for her personally are only hinted at. Still, the contradiction between caretaker and voyeur is present and the ending carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph thickens the emotional residue until the final image reweights the entire booth as cathedral. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena’s stance shifts from passive reader to active releaser of stored love, cost legible in the tear and the hushed thunder. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Minor ellipsis in how the letters actually fuse with celluloid is allowed under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The projection booth is rendered through precise sensory triangulation—red safety bulb, dusty beam, warming celluloid—and the film strip itself functions as micro-setting that constrains every action. Spatial choreography is flawless; distances and tools track cleanly. The final beam carrying “forgotten lyrics” recharges the booth’s atmosphere, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—locating and releasing unused love—is signaled early and escalates via accumulating emotional density rather than causal reversals. One decisive tightening: Elena moves from private reading to public projection, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is visible in the tear and the audible vibration of “hushed thunder,” though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme of abandoned affection as archival material emerges organically from the film’s chemistry and the projectionists’ unsent letters. Subtext operates in gesture (finger on sprocket holes) and silence. Final image of light carrying “forgotten lyrics” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—Elena notices through vibration, temperature, spatial expansion. Syntax modulates with emotional rise, and patterned elision (“unused love,” “hushed thunder”) is taught early and paid off. No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional figurative layering (“cathedral,” “quantum archive”) risks overwriting but stays within taught pattern. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Final third remains clean, sustaining momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Premise—psychometric projectionist harvesting unsent love from celluloid—is fresh and fully committed to. Tropes of haunted cinema and crystal gazing are transformed through tactile specificity and emotional specificity. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
