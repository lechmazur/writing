<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s shifting identities are embodied in the ritualized smelting and tide-cycle, but interior contradiction is more asserted than dramatized; the final synthesis is resonant yet feels lightly earned because the cost is poetic rather than viscerally staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide recedes to reveal a new composite self. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each moon-phase plate adds density—yet the causal linkage between smelting and identity shift is implied more than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vivid, selective, and purposeful: water level dictates access to texts and physically triggers the identity migration. The crystalline ceiling and cold forge flames are sensory anchors that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder through cyclical self-dissolution—is signaled early. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; the rising tide tightens the ritual frame but does not force a visible trade-off beyond poetic acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of identity as fluid archive emerges organically from the librarian’s ritual and the library’s own contradiction. Final whispered line reweights the premise without moralizing, though the insight remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through a contemplative yet mechanical sensibility. Syntax mirrors the tidal cadence; no POV drift or register clash. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with rhythmic variation and strong verbs. Occasional stacked modifiers (“wintersun serenity,” “story-silver”) flirt with overwriting but remain legible and pattern-consistent. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The fusion of lunar identity cycles with a submerged library is fresh and non-obvious. Tropes (librarian, moon phases) are transformed through tactile world logic and ritual specificity; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
