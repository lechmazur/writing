<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness drives every choice: it shapes her artistic method, her navigation of the guild, and her final epiphany about soul-pattern portraiture. Internal contradictions (precision vs loss) surface through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The shift from literal sky-mapping to invisible bonds earns closure via renunciation and visible cost—the tree’s loss and her pocketed coin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final etching of patterns redefines portraiture itself. The causal chain—coin indentations → algorithmic key → soul mapping—is tight across the tree’s last night. Each compression holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens, ending in charged poise as dawn breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The tree trunk library is felt through touch maps, moonlit constellations, and a trembling stillness before demolition. The hidden compartment constrains the find; the coin’s metal texture charges the act. Setting steadily narrows options—plaster, time, impending collapse—until the walls shimmer with faces only Elara can read.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens from gentle exploration to frantic dawn etching; each beat costs: stolen coin, broken plaster, burnt fingers. Stakes pivot from salvaging sky to immortalising essence as the bulldozer noise rises. A single choice—press pattern into clay before destruction—makes the decisive change without external rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of perceiving beyond the visible emerges through concrete particulars: touch instead of sight, coin indentations instead of faces. The final image of indistinct faces shimmering on the wall offers a non-literal answer about human connection. No tidy moral is stated; ambiguity lingers with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural voice modulates from tactile wonder to urgent rasping rhythm as dawn approaches. Free indirect style never leaks beyond Elara’s sensory logic. Lines compress (“the grain spiralled like breath”) under pressure without overwriting. No dialogue; percussive diction echoes demolition beats.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences breathe with tree rings—long reverberations in moonlight, staccato scrapes of coin on clay. No redundancy; each image advances the fractal sequence. Rhythm tightens alongside stakes. Vocabulary stays within Elara’s artisan lexicon until the crystallised pattern re-weights perception.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The face-blind artist armed with fractal precision through a centuries-old coin feels fresh yet inevitable. Soul-pattern portraiture subverts both classical and algorithmic art clichés. The tree’s final gift—an untranslatable coin method—charges a universal theme of connection without flattening complexity.</comment>
