<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied, but the tutor’s contradictory impulses remain muted; the final whispered name feels more ritual than earned choice, so cost is present yet not fully scaled to the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing needle reconfigures meaning and forecloses the old stasis. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the lace pattern’s late reveal slightly strains causality but is paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Islet, petrichor, salt, and dew are selective and POV-filtered; the compass and lace act as micro-settings that constrain ritual choices. Weather and light subtly mirror the emotional arc without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightened once when the needle locks on his heart. The cost is felt but diffuse; escalation is more cadence shift than irreversible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation through ritual attention emerges organically from ritual particulars; the final hue of apology resonates without moralizing. Subtext in compass and bonsai avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is slow, lyrical, and consistent; syntax mirrors the tutor’s cadence. No dialogue, so no risk of convergence. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is sonorous yet disciplined; occasional stacked modifiers (“cerulean regret,” “transcendent beauty”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ghost-ship compass as memory lodestone and lace as instruction manual feel fresh; synthesis of bonsai patience with maritime grief is non-obvious. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
