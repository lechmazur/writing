<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but remains high-level; moments like “precisely playful” are told rather than dramatized in micro-choice, so the epiphany cost feels generalized rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure delivers the promised Conceptual Repricing—“walkers also choose their paths”—with charged image of sunrise through vines; beats accumulate rather than rely on causal linkage, coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Bunker and storm frame mood beautifully, but the vine-filtered sunlight only decorates the final beat without altering tactics; it satisfies specificity but stops short of constraining the closing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Storm-catalyst escalation is sensory and unifying; one meaningful pivot—dream-transcendence—that crystallizes “fate vs free will” with unmistakable cost of perpetual triple-vision burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically through journey; final line reconfigures premise non-didactically, avoiding moralizing despite temptation.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is lush and consistent, compressing without head-hop; occasional overwriting (“ethereal grit of the place settling into her bones”) is still aligned with lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm propels, metaphors mostly clean; minor scaffolds like “each passing season” and stock “surrendered to sleep” dull precision but never obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—vision restricted to past/future—feels fresh and fully embraced; synthesis with reciprocal destiny gives satisfying inevitability.</comment>
