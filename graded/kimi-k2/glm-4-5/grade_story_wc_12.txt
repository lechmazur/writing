<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Father Michael’s interiority is vivid—trembling fingers, embodied awe—but his contradictory impulses (faith vs. techno-heresy) are asserted rather than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of volume for silence is earned, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Sarah remains a prop, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the indigo flare and ensuing hush reweight the premise, showing silence as active exorcism. Causal chain holds—each loop pedal press tightens the sonic cage—though the dimensional-anchor rules are taught late. Cost is legible in the priest’s drained stillness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s “unraveled stillness” is palpable, pressing on eardrums; the indigo paint and loop pedal serve as micro-setting that constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects track. Environment charges the final image when symbols flare and fade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Sarah before integration—signaled early. Escalation is causal: each loop layer narrows the entity’s options. The rhetorical question “Can that which is eternal…” forces a visible falter; cost is the priest’s exhaustion and the entity’s dissolution. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-power emerges organically from the priest’s method; no moralizing. The indigo void reweighted from threat to key offers conceptual repricing. Final image—“echoes lingering like afterimage”—invites reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is ecclesiastical-technical hybrid: “sonic architecture,” “dimensional anchor.” Rhythm modulates with pedal layers; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—priest notices frequencies and pigment absorption—holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“plumb the depths”) fits clerical register. Metaphors cohere—indigo “absorbs light”—and do not clog climax. One mixed moment: “muffled clarity” is conceptually clever but slightly opaque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Loop-pedal exorcism fused with indigo void-paint feels fresh; tropes of possession and techno-ritual are transformed through specific sensory choices. Risky synthesis pays off: the final silence-as-weapon reconfigures genre expectations without gimmickry.</comment>
