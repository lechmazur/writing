<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Poet’s insomnia and “photosynthesize pain into beauty” motive are stated, not dramatized; no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Final renunciation (to die awake so others dream) is asserted rather than earned through visible cost. Interiority drifts toward lyrical summary rather than specific, character-bound perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: poet’s death crystallizes centuries of lullabies into the shell’s living memory. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern taught early but escalation is diffuse, lacking a decisive tightening beat. Orientation holds; shell, postcard, and blossoms remain coherent spatial anchors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Shell’s pearlescent walls and bioluminescent blossoms are vividly rendered and constrain the poet’s nightly ritual. Galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (reef-shadow scent, off-key wind) supports atmosphere without clutter. Spatial choreography stays clean across centuries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform sleepless suffering into communal rest—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through blossoming coverage, but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. Conflict remains abstract; poet’s agency is observational rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting pain into communal beauty emerges through image and action rather than statement. Final reprise of lullabies reweights the opening insomnia as generative legacy. Subtext is present but occasionally diluted by overt poetic declarations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Consistent lyric-omniscient voice with controlled poetic diction; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates between long breath and fragmentary pulse, mirroring sleepless cadence. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ensconce themselves within its mysteries”) slightly exceeds character lexicon but remains coherent within mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; metaphors stay coherent. Minor loop: “shyly unstoppable” and “half-sung lullabies” repeat without new pressure. Density is high; each sentence advances image or stakes. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic postcard, bioluminescent armistice, and centuries-spanning insomnia feels fresh and inevitable. Premise risks whimsy but grounds itself in sensory specificity. Risk-taking (centuries in 700 words) succeeds via accumulative texture rather than causal compression.</comment>
