<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—thumb on granite, ribbon as meditation—but the “spectral mentor” remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final renunciation (ribbon nearly gone, mentor’s work “complete”) is legible, yet the cost feels generalized rather than embodied in a single, costly micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the monument reframes grief from individual to collective, with the ribbon’s depletion as visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification via butterflies, poems, ribbon knots—held cleanly to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse dusk, granite dust, and migrating monarchs are vivid and selective; the bench and ribbon function as micro-settings that constrain Elias’s path. Final image of amber wings against glass recharges the opening dusk light, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape collective grief—tightens once when Elias commits to the communal monument. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each poem-knot and butterfly cluster increases density until the final reconfiguration. Cost (ribbon spent, mentor departed) is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: ribbon, butterflies, poems, stone. Final image offers non-literal answer—migration as shared transformation—without moralizing. Subtext in the mentor’s silence and the villagers’ wordless awe deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in tactile craft; perceptual signature centers on stone dust, ribbon texture, wing-beat air. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; free-indirect style stays consistent. Rhythm modulates with dusk calm and migratory urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but occasional stacked metaphors (“thundering calm,” “wildness within stillness”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Minor register drift toward the oracular in mentor’s quoted lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Gravestone carver + spectral mentorship + butterfly migration is a fresh synthesis; grief reframed as collective flight pattern feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in final image. Avoids stock tropes through sensory specificity.</comment>
