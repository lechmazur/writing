<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction clear in the skeptic/convert arc, embodied in tingling skin and shifting taste, but motivation leans abstract (“understand why”) rather than rooted in personal loss or gain; final acceptance still feels inevitable because the compass choice is dramatized with costly fusion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Situational under coherent natural/atmospheric pressure that crystallizes one decisive choice: the tactile convergence with the storm man under auroral vote. Closure in the dissolution ring image bears unmistakable cost—eternal symbiosis with no exit shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Lavender bluff, aurora, humming roots, and metal-tongue ozone create specific immediate ground; final reprise of lavender flowers widening beneath fused bodies ties environment to transformation. Setting doesn’t constrain a later tactic, so capped at 7.7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>One clear stake signaled early—will the skeptic accept weather-carrying? Middle tightening arrives when the compass burns and salt tears foreshadow intimate cost. Convergence choice reconfigures identity under live forest vote; price is fusion, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of reluctant stewardship versus symbiosis emerges through the sensory arc; final dissolution of ring into skin answers without didacticism. Tension between human memory and elemental duty lingers with earned ambiguity.</comment>

<comment>Voice is luminous but tactile; metallic-to-sweet taste shifts mirror interior states; prose rhythm pulses like aurora without drifting into purple. Distinct texture in phrases like “forests holding elections through rustling leaves.”</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft dense but propulsive; no loops, mixed metaphors minor (“memories of rain on childhood windowpanes” flirts cliché but is forgiven for sensory payoff). Occasional hyphenated compounds feel coined yet coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh weather-carriers as hereditary ecosystem stewards avoids trope checklist; “forests holding elections” is a fresh, non-sentimental device. The symbiosis climax feels inevitable yet non-derivative.</comment>
