<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Loran’s quiet enthusiasm vs. “stellar doubt” tension is embodied in the shaky coin toss and trembling fingers, but the interiority leans on labels (‘stellar doubt’ ‘cosmic focus’) rather than contradiction, and Korin drifts into observer status so status pressure dissipates—yet the cost of broadcasting humanity’s evolutionary signature lands palpably.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear causal lens: contraction forces the choice → static bursts filtered → coins decide → input coordinates triggers rebirth. Closure (fold inward to begin again) lands with conceptual cost—humanity may not recognize itself after rebirth—and the obsidian/coin spiral reframes earlier shots.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The ambered observatory and contracting skybox are immersive; obsidian slab and vibrating coins constrain Loran’s final decision, re-charging the final image. Only minor haziness: spatial relation of coin spiral to slab could be 5 cm or 5 m—doesn’t hinder the beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—determine rebirth vs. witness death—ratchets with each shrinking light-second. Tightening is single: realization spiral replaces annihilation with fold. Coin formation forecloses prior dread, cost is the unknowable new universe, felt in Korin’s hush and Loran’s tremble.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme of cyclic death/rebirth emerges through ambered contraction imagery and spiral coin pattern; unobstructed by overt moral. Final realization reweights earlier pessimism without a slogan. But “wavelength align with purpose” skirts echo-laden abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question>
<comment>Voice is elevated sci-fi poetic with perceptual signature; however, diction slips toward ornate (“cosmic amber glow” “evolutionary signature align”) under peak tension and Korin’s internality is ventriloquized through Loran.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Strong cadence and selective sensory detail (“amber fracture”, “compress galaxies”). Minor diction echoes (“quiet enthusiasm” repeats) and one mixed metaphor (“static bursts telling”). Overall clarity sustains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Universal contraction as decision-oracle via coin prophecy feels novel; neither fortune-teller nor apocalypse trope alone. Spiral fold resolution transforms stock entropy into fresh cyclical rebirth. Slight derivative shimmer in ‘broadcasting evolutionary signature’ trope, but execution feels specific and earned under pressure.</comment>
