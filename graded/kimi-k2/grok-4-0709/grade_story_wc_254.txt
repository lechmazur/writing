<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s aesthetically driven trait is embodied in every beat—his tactile tracing of quartz, the deliberate paraphrasing, the final whispered verse—so motivation stays vivid. Interior contradiction is present: awe versus fear of the colonnade. The Earned Stasis (renunciation of conquest for communion) is fully earned and carries visible cost: the atrium’s boundaries dissolve, leaving him forever changed. Minor slip: “tremor of certainty” is labeled more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is tight; orientation is anchored by word 60. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the colonnade’s hum shifts from barrier to invitation, crystallizing Elias’s stance. Causal chain—ban lifted → poet enters → paraphrase → boundaries dissolve—is clean. Cost is legible in the final image: the frozen lake cracks in release, a felt ecological price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake are not backdrop; the quartz pillars literally constrain action and their glow charges the final image. Micro-setting (pillar under his palm) guides the paraphrase choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: muted sky, lantern-moth hush, scent of forgotten blooms. Spatial choreography is flawless—no drift in distances or object states.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: dissolve sacred boundaries without desecration. Pressure tightens once: the hum’s shift from threat to acceptance hinges on Elias’s paraphrase. Agency is active; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is visible: the lake cracks, the atrium’s aura is forever altered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as respectful transgression—emerges through action, not statement. Subtext lives in the shift from “ban” to “invitation.” Final image reweights earlier motifs: the lantern-moth hush becomes an open door. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what else the dissolved veil may release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—cloud-shadow metaphors, lantern-moth hush. Syntax modulates with intensity: longer cadence for awe, clipped fragments for the tremor of certainty. No head-hopping; POV distance remains intimate. Diction stays within poet’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Figurative language is selective—no purple overload. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Rhythm mirrors scene: soft hum builds to tremor then release. Opening and closing lines are crisp and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: poet as boundary-dissolver via linguistic paraphrase, not conquest. Transforms the “forbidden sanctuary” trope into an aesthetic communion. Specificity of cobalt veins, quartz hum, and cloud-shadow diction makes the world irreplaceable. Risky lyric mode pays off in a charged final image.</comment>
