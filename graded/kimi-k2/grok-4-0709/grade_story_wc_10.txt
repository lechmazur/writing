<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “translate silence into music” is clear and intensifies, but interiority drifts toward poetic summary (“terror of the capsize…grief for lost shipmates”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final choice is earned, yet the cost is more asserted than dramatized on her body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the first audible note reweights the premise with felt cost—her tears and softening face show the price of reopening sound. Causal linkage holds: capsize → silence → conservatory → tuning fork → heat-map → sound, all within 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Winterglass Conservatory is vivid, selective, and purposeful; frost-etched panes and ice-lilies constrain movement and supply the thermal apparatus that enables the final act. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the dome’s glass becomes an active resonator at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sound—is signaled early and tightens once: the heat-mapping attempt risks emotional exposure. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the silence. Cost is visible in her trembling hands and tear-brimmed eyes, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as both wound and canvas, music reborn from emotional heat. The final image of “music born from emotion’s heat” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity lingers—sound returns, yet the world remains fragile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature favors synesthetic imagery (“reds flaring…blues shifting”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s sensorium. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive, but occasional poetic overload (“silent symphony…secrets kept from a noiseless void”) slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Premise—global silence reversed by emotional thermography—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure is justified by the theme. Specificity of “ice-lilies” and “thermal lenses” grounds the fantastical in tactile detail.</comment>
