<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grim optimism is embodied in every beat—his dice rolls, notebook scribbles, and final step through the door all spring from the same contradictory impulse. The chipped die as emblem of imperfection is a deft, character-specific anchor. Interiority stays mathematically precise yet emotionally legible. Only the “missed opportunity” regret is slightly abstract, keeping it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the staircase’s rupture reweights the premise and carries visible cost in Elias’s wondering if freedom is another illusion. Causal lens holds—each proof line tightens options until entropy halts infinity. Orientation is immediate; no drift. A hairline slip: the rupture’s mechanics feel slightly off-stage, nudging it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The staircase is evoked through tactile pressure—cold stone, echoing steps—rather than panoramic description. The dice and notebook function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image of the flattening steps recharges the opening vista. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rupturing perpetual motion to seize regret’s texture—is signaled early and escalates via each theorem. One decisive tightening: the proof’s completion triggers the tremor. Cost is felt in Elias’s lingering doubt. Could be sharper if the rupture exacted a physical toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of endless motion versus entropic decay, never sermonized. The chipped die’s reprise at the end reweights the motif of imperfection. Final image invites reflection without moralizing. Slight abstraction around “texture of missed opportunity” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is mathematically lean yet haunted, fitting Elias’s POV. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the tremor, longer proofs during calm. No head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“quod erat demonstrandum”) feels earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances proof or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“machine running out of unseen fuel”) are precise. One mixed image—“slippery regret”—slightly muddies clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical proof and metaphysical prison; the staircase as literalized perpetual-motion machine feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the abstract stakes pays off. Near-echo of Borges is transformed through Elias’s embodied struggle.</comment>
