**Evaluation strictly under Global Scope, Gates, Lens (Hybrid: lyrical-accumulative) and Non-Closure Accumulation Cap –– no adjustment to Q9 independent scores.**

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desperation is vivid and embodied, but interior monologue slips toward diagnostic self-awareness (“override primal urges”) and an emotional telegraph beats that cost some specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly in a Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures the hush into captured essence. Causality holds under an accumulative lens; only the second-half exposition lulls weaken crisp linkage.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Temple’s crushing silence and bioluminescent corals are selective and charged; the vial later becomes micro-setting that constrains final action. Spatial choreography remains coherent within the single-scene frame.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival vs transcendence—tightens via dwindling oxygen; pressure crystallizes in a final act that trades flight for stillness, legible cost on the page.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ephemeral memory as theme emerges through scent and stillness rather than statement. The ending image distills longing into glowing vial, offering non-direct answers that reweight the premise.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person interiority is consistent; diction modulates under panic without register drift. Only occasional filter-verb clusters (“she knew”/“she realized”) blunt immediacy under peak pressure.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Highly textured prose avoids purple overload; rhythm serves panic/awe. Template cadence in “she… then she” runs and a density of metaphors at climax warrant minor deduction.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines survival, scent-memory, and aquatic hush in a non-obvious synthesis. Risk—stillness-as-action—heightens stakes without gimmickry, yielding inevitability after hushed foreshadowing.</question>
