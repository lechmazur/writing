<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—reporting neighbors yet secretly aiding them—are dramatized through the whittling ritual and the bouquet exchange; the blank mask and theatrical narration externalize the split while the final “cultivated lightness” lands as earned endurance with visible moral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira leaves with the augmented bouquet, Elias remains in Earned Stasis, and the turbines’ hush reweights the premise. Causal linkage holds—each whittling stroke and absurd narration tightens the risk—while the final image crystallizes the cost of complicity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse, turbines, and brittle bouquet anchor every beat; the turbines’ drone and slicing blades externalize the mandate’s pressure, while the bouquet’s dried petals constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to mourn without detection—tightens once: Mira’s arrival forces Elias to risk exposure. The whittling-as-camouflage escalates the danger, and the final hand-off exacts a visible moral price, though the beat count is minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the absurd narration masking grief: lightness as complicity. The turbines’ remade hush and the “renewed” bouquet reweight the premise without moralizing, leaving a resonant aftertaste of complicity and endurance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—mock-epic baritone against blank affect, perceptual signature tight. The patterned elision of true feeling is taught early and paid off in the final tableau; no head-hopping, diction stays within Elias’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional stacked metaphors (“whirlwind ballet”) flirt with overwriting but serve the performative mask; no loops or scaffold, final image lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia is familiar, yet the grief-laundering ritual via mock-epic whittling feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of the bouquet, turbines, and blank mask transforms the trope; the moral calculus is non-obvious and lingers.</comment>
