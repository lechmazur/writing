<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to “touch borrowed time” is vivid, but her interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“furiously tranquil pulse”) that tells rather than dramatizes contradiction. The seed-saver identity is stated, never weaponized in a micro-choice; the acorn-cap placement feels inherited, not personally urgent. Still, her embodied tremor under cold and the final smile give us credible emotional progression with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the vortex re-opens, inheritance reclaimed, cost felt in the phoenix’s departure and thawing atrium. Causal chain (egg → cap → entropy reversal → portal) holds without gaps; no orientation debt. One minor slack: the “texture of borrowed time” is declared, not given tactile payoff inside the visions—slight CR shortfall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound glass, starlight mirrors, and the acorn cap’s runic glow are selectively detailed and directly enable the entropy-reversal ritual. Spatial choreography is immaculate; distance from pedestal to vortex center tracks. The atrium’s cold literally constrains Elara’s kneeling and timing, charging the final thaw with tangible consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“borrowed time”—is signaled early and tightened when the cap must be placed before the phoenix flutters away. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: failure means sealed inheritance forever. The price (phoenix lost, atrium thawing) is legible, yet the middle lacks a beat where Elara questions or risks actual bodily harm, keeping pressure one-note.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of temporal stewardship versus entropy emerges through ritual action rather than statement; the oak cap’s ordered growth opposing chaos is elegantly understated. Final image of “seeds of time to plant in fertile chaos” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. One echo too on-the-nose: “texture of borrowed time” is repeated rather than finally embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly bound to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors chill, star-reflected light and soil-scented wind. Syntax flexes from long incantatory lines to short shivers under cold, mirroring her “furiously tranquil” tension. No head-hopping or register drift; occasional adjective stacks (“wild serenity—untamed energy wrapped in peaceful glow”) flirt with excess but remain legible.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—slow frost etchings accelerate into vortex hum. Information density high: one sentence often layers sensory, symbolic, and causal work. Minor loop: “furiously tranquil” appears three times with diminishing returns; trimming one would sharpen peak beat. Metaphors stay coherent (ice/order vs. chaos) and never obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Temporal phoenix hatching from a seed-saver’s heirloom is fresh, and linking entropy reversal to an oak acorn cap gives concrete mythic tech. The vortex-inheritance trope nods to familiar portal fantasy, but grounding it in agrarian seed stewardship particularizes the concept. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot surprise—yet the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
