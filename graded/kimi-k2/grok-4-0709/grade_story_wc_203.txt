<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s ghost-sight and childhood trauma anchor motivation, but interiority drifts into summary (“he knew better”) rather than embodied contradiction. His final winding of the barrel is a decisive micro-choice that costs him solitude, yet the shift feels slightly neat given the prior weightless exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: anonymous call → arrival → ghost manifestation → ceiling discovery → winding reversal. Closure lands on-page with luminous dissipation and felt cost—Elias is left “in quiet solitude.” One minor causality wobble: the childhood ceiling accident is told, not dramatized, but it primes the final image without breaking linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Abandoned circus office is vividly sketched—peeling posters, erratic fluorescents, sagging panels—yet the dust-pattern clue is the only moment setting actively constrains choice. Micro-setting (ceiling cavity) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: free trapped performers vs. Elias’s need to uncover ceilings’ secrets. Pressure tightens once when ghosts point upward, forcing the climb and winding. Cost is visible—spectral release leaves Elias alone—but escalation is single-beat, not cumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden histories and illusion’s fragility emerges through the cracked barrel and dissolving ghosts. No overt moralizing; final solitude reweights earlier wonder into elegy. Slight abstraction in “fragile threads of forgotten lives” keeps it from higher resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—toolkit clinks, dust motes, brass etchings observed with technician precision. Rhythm modulates with tension: longer sentences for atmosphere, clipped fragments under ghost pressure. No POV drift or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous wisps,” “eternal loops”) edges toward decorative but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing elevator tech, ghost lore, and circus myth into a compact haunting feels fresh. The mainspring barrel as soul-cage is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is moderate—ghost story in abandoned venue is familiar—but execution transforms trope through tactile detail and causal closure.</comment>
