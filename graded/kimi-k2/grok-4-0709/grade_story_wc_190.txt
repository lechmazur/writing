<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—teaching silence while still haunted by his own loss—surfaces in micro-choices (pole rhythm, pauses, vial demonstration). Mira’s shift from frantic chatter to whispered thanks is embodied in breath and posture, not labels. The cost is felt: Elias relinquishes his own protective hush to offer it to her. Minor slip: Mira’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each refracted image and hushed pause layers density until the final crystalline stillness reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the shared silence now cradles both souls, cost visible in Elias’s relinquishment of his own shield. Orientation is swift; the drifting terrace and gondola are anchored by sensory cues within 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism terrace is not backdrop; its refracted light and echoing acoustics actively shape Elias’s teaching method and Mira’s surrender. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when Mira’s breath visibly stirs its crystals. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and surfaces track across every pole stroke. One minor over-description of “vaulting expanse” slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can silence be taught as comfort—tightens through Elias’s calibrated pauses and Mira’s rising unease. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mira’s exhale stills the vial, foreclosing her frantic option. Cost is legible: Elias must reopen his own wound to offer balm. No external coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refracted light and the storm glass: order from stillness, beauty from internal weather. Subtext lives in gesture—the vial passed back with whispered thanks carries more weight than any declaration. Final image of dawn fracturing through prisms offers a non-literal answer: silence, like light, can be both prism and balm. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the gondola’s glide and the hush’s swell. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices sound levels and light refractions with professional intimacy. No POV drift; Mira’s interior is inferred only through observable breath and posture. One near-purple phrase—“silent symphonies that danced on the edges of perception”—is forgiven for pattern consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes without redundancy. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—storm glass as emotional barometer, prisms as both beauty and constraint. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor filter verb cluster (“he began,” “he started”) in one beat costs 0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The floating prism terrace and storm-glass pedagogy synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh emotional engine. The concept of teaching silence through atmospheric optics feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with near-lyric accumulation, yet clarity holds. Deduction for faint echo of “storm glass as heart” motif from prior published works.</comment>
