<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with “texture of time” is vivid and embodied in tactile design work; the retrocognitive trap forces a credible, costly renunciation of the fragment. Interiority is specific—hedge geometry as felt knowledge—but a few lines verge on abstract “reverie” labels rather than embodied contradiction, capping the score just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the halo fragment disintegrates, snapping the retrocognitive hold and leaving Elias with a charged poise—new maze, lost fragment, felt cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each vision layer tightens the pattern until the hyperbolic warp ruptures it. One minor orientation wobble—exact spatial anchor on the bridge arrives late—but it serves the disorientation effect, so penalty waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not backdrop; its breathing vines and hyperbolic curves physically trap and then steady Elias, constraining the escape geometry. Sensory detail is selective—moss, leaf-rustle, light motes—filtered through his designer’s eye. Micro-setting (the halo shard) also functions as charged object, meeting the 9+ gate, but the garden itself could have been leveraged one beat deeper to breach 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery over time’s texture—faces a clear test: the retrocognitive flood threatens permanent entrapment. Escalation is one sustained tightening under Accumulative lens; each historical vignette increases density until the hyperbolic gambit ruptures the loop. Cost is felt—the fragment’s loss and the lingering gritty residue of time—but the trade-off is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just under 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: obsession with mapping infinity collapses into acceptance of time’s rough, ungraspable weave. The fading photographs motif threads through visions and final disintegration, reweighted at closure without overt statement. Subtext is carried by geometry and texture rather than moralizing. A hairline slip—“quaking reverie” used twice—leans toward label, preventing 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under retrocognitive pressure. Perceptual signature—hedge designer’s spatial lexicon—remains consistent. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“hyperbolic expansion,” “spectral particles”) skirts register drift but stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon, capping at 8.3.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. One paraphrase loop—“quaking… quaked… quaking”—and a filter-verb cluster (“he felt”) in the crisis beat blunt momentum slightly. Otherwise, sentences advance multiple jobs, and the final image lands clean. Artifacts are minor but visible, disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—living hedge mazes as portals to retrocognitive time—feels fresh and specific, synthesized through Elias’s craft rather than ornament. Hyperbolic geometry as escape method is non-obvious yet foreshadowed. Risky lyric compression pays off in the closure image. No close echoes detected. Slight reliance on “fading photographs” trope keeps it from 9.0.</comment>
