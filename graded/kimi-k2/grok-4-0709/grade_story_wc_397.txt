<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—seeking death yet volunteering to salvage life—are embodied in her tactile use of the parasol tip; the final renunciation of passive surrender is earned through prior beats and carries visible cost as she trawls on in the storm. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “changed self anchored” edges toward summary rather than embodied state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fold in patience becomes acceptance charged by the windborne sigh. Causal chain holds—botched euthanasia → altered senses → volunteering → capsized boat → final stance—each beat tightening options. Cost is legible in the final image: she stays to trawl, path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure system: groaning ice dictates tactics, capsizing boat forces choice, wind fractures camp. Parasol tip functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges closure. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens when the capsized boat’s hum mirrors her own postponed death, forcing acceptance. Escalation is coherent under situational lens: environmental pressure crystallizes stance. Cost is felt in her decision to remain amid the storm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of endings as beginnings emerges through concrete particulars: parasol tip shifts from relic to trawling talisman, grandmother’s summer shade reconfigured into arctic solace. No moralizing; final image reweights premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with perceptual signature of altered senses—“reality slipped through her fingers like melting snow.” Patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor mixed metaphor—“patience woven thin”—does not obscure causality or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist turned volunteer trawler offers fresh synthesis; parasol tip as arctic divining rod is specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
