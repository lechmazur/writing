<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scientist’s curiosity vs. visceral fear—plays out in embodied beats (tingling fingers, greening skin). The final surrender is earned by prior struggle and costs her human form, visible on the page. Minor slip: “circuitously sincere” is asserted more than dramatized in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s hybrid state crystallizes the stake and carries felt cost (loss of full humanity). Causal lens holds—storm → leaf → transformation—without gaps. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mossy trellis and storm-wet air are vivid, selective, and constrain her final rooting. The linden leaf fused to her palm becomes micro-setting that charges the last image. One minor spatial drift: “under the trellis” vs. “at the nursery’s edge” could tighten.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she resist or surrender to metamorphosis—tightens once when she stops struggling. Cost is visible: irreversible bodily change. Agency drives the turn; storm pressure is coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of surrender-as-survival emerges through concrete events; final image of fused leaf reweights earlier plant studies without moralizing. Subtext in her roundabout self-talk avoids explicit thesis. One soft echo of “beauty in yielding” near end, but resonance remains earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet precise, with plant-biased perceptual signature (“chlorophyll hues,” “bark-like yet flexible”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—longer sentences calm, fragments spike during transformation. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. One minor loop: “reconstructing not just the trellis, but her very purpose” restates prior beat. No artifacts in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical science and body-horror metamorphosis; transformation trope is grounded in specific horticultural detail. Risky surrender resolution feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
