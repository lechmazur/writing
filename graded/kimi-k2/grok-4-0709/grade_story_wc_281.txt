<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alex’s affectionate skepticism is embodied in micro-choices—handing Mia the geode, whispering “Let’s try”—and the final embrace shows earned softening. Interiority stays concrete: “fractally precise” visions overwhelm rather than diagnose. The cost is felt when his shoulders soften against her fear of disinterest. Minor slip: “willowglass hope” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: static shock triggers telepathy → geode grounding → somatic mapping → joint light painting that reconfigures their bond. Closure lands in the final image—intertwined light trails and pressed geode—with relational cost: skepticism “softened, not erased.” Orientation is anchored by word 60. One causal leap (pill recall coinciding with shock) is allowed under situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The studio’s LED wands, tripods, and neural-network light trails constrain tactics: they become the medium for translating telepathy into art. Muscovite sliver doubles as micro-setting, taped to a light wand to refract fractal beams. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. Setting charges the final image rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can they bridge communication—tightens once: chaotic telepathy → devised somatic map → joint creation. Agency is Alex’s throughout; coincidence (shock) only complicates. Cost is the emotional exposure when Mia’s doubt surfaces and Alex’s skepticism must bend. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of “illuminating hidden pathways” emerges from concrete action—light painting literalizes emotional mapping—without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the geode passed hand-to-hand, the synchronized wand strokes. Final image reweights earlier skepticism into fragile, earned connection. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile and specific—“mica-flecked crystal,” “willowglass thin and resilient”—with rhythmic variation under pressure. POV stays locked in Alex; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual: “Come help me illuminate…” carries dual meaning. Occasional elevated diction (“fractally precise”) is justified by altered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or tactic. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“light trails mimicked neural networks” sustains the fractal motif. Filter verbs are minimal; strong verbs (“refracting beams,” “pressed between them”) carry motion. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy pill recall + light painting + somatic mapping yields a non-obvious emotional diagnostic. Tropes (telepathy, crystals) are grounded in specific relationship stakes. Risky compression of sci-fi and lyric modes pays off in the final image. Transformation test: story collapses without these exact elements.</comment>
