<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s inner drive—“to preserve the color of wonder”—is vivid and embodied in every micro-choice, from opening the locket to kneeling in moss, but the final beat risks sentimental summary rather than raw, contradicted emotion. The insatiable creativity is shown in pruning gestures, not merely labeled. Interiority remains specific and textured; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual thread of mist, seed, spell, and planting accumulates until the final image reconfigures meaning—the orchard glows anew. Closure is legible as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + Earned Stasis): wonder is transplanted, the cost the subtle shrinking of the “fading hue” in her own world. No orientation debt; physical and temporal anchors arrive within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The waterfall’s mist, mossy stone, and shimmering seed integrate with every move; the setting does not merely frame but guides—water’s roar softens to a hush that cues the crossing. Mist becomes semi-permeable veil at closure, charging the final image. Sensory choices are selective and purposeful; no spatial drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“wonder is waning”—is signaled in paragraph two and intensifies via each beat: threshold moment at the seed, trans-planar harvest, planting, visitation rush. One meaningful tightening: the act of capturing essence forecloses staying in the luminous world. Cost is felt—she loses some iridescence of her own realm—but lightly dramatized; still passes the bar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete choices: pruning as an art of care then trans-dimension grafting, the subtle critique of adults’ “mere science.” Final image reweights rather than moralizes. Sentiment flirts with explicitness—“eternal dawn”—but avoids thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate voice is lush yet exact: “mist-kissed vines clung,” “radiant hush.” Syntax breathes with rise and fall of ritual; no filter-verb glut. Perceptual signature is Elowen’s orchard-eyed gaze; no POV leakage. Occasional lyrical lift is earned by pattern and closure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control and concrete diction; nearly every line doubles duty. Minor scaffold stems (“as if”) and near-redundant phrases (“glowing serenity,” “radiant calm”) occur in two adjacent beats, warranting a small deduction but never obscuring clarity or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusing orchard craft with trans-realm agriculture feels fresh; the heirloom seed trope is revitalized through tactile pruning verbs. Closest analogue might be Studio Ghibli pastoral portals, yet the specificity of pruning choreography and waning-wonder anxiety carves distinct space.</comment>
