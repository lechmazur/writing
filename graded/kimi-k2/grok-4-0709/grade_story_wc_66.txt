<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, hushed vow—but the “teach dust to tell stories” motive is asserted more than dramatized until the final dust tableau. The moment he rests his hands carries earned cost, yet earlier beats lack micro-choices that complicate his stance. Still, the contradiction between meticulous copyist and outlaw broadcaster is embodied in the act of cloaking lyrics, giving him specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dust’s luminous vignettes crystallize the new narrative ecology, cost paid in Elias’s exhaustion. Causal chain—radio discovery → cloaked lyrics → dust learning—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each broadcast thickens pattern until the alcove itself reconfigures. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, perpetual mist, and glowing dial are not backdrop but instruments: the mist hides the signal, the embers power the radio, the dust becomes screen and speaker. Spatial choreography is tight—bench, dial, drifting motes track cleanly. One slip: “thistled calm” is vivid but never tactilely grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving stories under surveillance—tightens once: the risk of detection forces the cloaking tactic, narrowing options. Cost is visible in Elias’s nightly vigil and the final spent stillness. Escalation is single-arc but sufficient for 700 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of resurrection-through-fragments emerges from the dust’s silent re-enactments, never sermonized. The requiem lyric “embers weaving forgotten dreams” reweights the opening image of ember alcove into a living archive. Subtext carries in the radio’s heartbeat pulse—technology as clandestine womb.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a copyist’s tactile diction—“faded scores,” “cryptic refrains.” Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for misty description, clipped fragments during tuning. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains Elias’s hushed, ink-scented focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters around the dust motif without clogging beats. Occasional poetic overlap—“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous”—is pattern-taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses steampunk pirate radio with particle-narrative magic; feels inevitable yet fresh. Transformation test passes—swap dust for pollen and the emotional arc collapses. Risk in lyric density is rewarded by closure clarity.</comment>
