<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—yearning for sound yet fearing the cost of failure—surface in micro-choices (tracing cracks, adjusting touch). The final strumming sequence crystallizes her values and exacts a visible emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test. A slight reserve: the hedgehog’s presence, while atmospheric, never pressures her choice, so relationship-as-crucible is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove’s silence is not broken but “enriched,” a felt conceptual shift. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each strum deepens pattern until the porcelain sings. Cost is legible in Elara’s tears and the knowledge that “her work had just begun.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The alder grove, porcelain insulator, and even the hedgehog’s quills function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: the cracks dictate fingering, the grove’s hush demands gentleness. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The porcelain’s evolving state (cracked relic → resonant heart) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sound—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: silence thickens until the first faint hum reweights it. Agency is Elara’s iterative strumming; cost is the emotional toll and the open-ended labor ahead. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of empathy as shared rhythm emerges through action, not statement; the cracks become “intervals waiting to be played.” Final image of enriched silence offers non-literal answer: connection without noise. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “more sculptures awaited.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with symphonic cadences taught early (“her thoughts weaving like movements”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara hears visual patterns. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Compression and elision (“the world had fallen silent long ago”) are taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves pattern, not ornament. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Rhythm modulates with scene needs—long breaths for discovery, clipped pulses for strumming. Minor elevated diction (“symphonically minded”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—music from fracture analysis in a silent world—is fresh and fully committed. Porcelain insulator as instrument-heart transforms trope of broken relic into resonant vessel. Specificity of hedgehog’s dawn cue and alder bark scores anchors universals. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
