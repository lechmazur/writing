<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt over infecting his lover is palpable, but the interiority slips into summary (“gnawed at him”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final integration of remorse is dramatized through taste-alchemy, yet the lover’s absence keeps relationship pressure off-stage. Motivation is clear and stakes personal, but the micro-choice to absorb the orb feels slightly under-cooked in cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias re-enters dawn “sanded smooth,” the cost felt in the pavilion’s tremor. Causal chain—tidal sign → dig → descent → absorption—holds under a lyrical lens. Orientation is swift; dream logic is taught early and paid off. Minor drift: the staircase “gave way” too easily, blurring agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Desert rain, slick battlements, and coral ice walls are vivid and selective. The tidal pool’s salt-veins and bioluminescent coral constrain Elias’s next move, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; fortress-to-pavilion transition is dream-elastic yet legible. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; a colder tactile shock would sharpen the shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-redemption from guilt—is signaled early and tightened when the orb’s scenes lock onto his betrayal. Absorption is the decisive act that forecloses denial; tremor signals cost. Pressure is coherent but single-note; no external obstacle complicates the descent. Escalation is lyrical, not causal, yet sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of remorse-as-flavor emerges organically through Elias’s gift and the coral vaults. Subtext avoids moralizing; the final image of dawn-lit smoothness reweights the premise without sermon. Coral lattice as frozen regret is a fresh metaphor that resonates. Slight risk of abstraction in “world’s unspoken regrets,” but context grounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is sensorily precise and consistent: “taste memories…bitter remorse like overripe fruit.” Dream-grammar (“mind teetering on the edge of waking”) is taught early and held. No dialogue; interior monologue stays chef-specific. Minor drift into elevated diction (“repository for the world’s unspoken regrets”) but recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and coherent (“coral branches frozen in eternal winter”). Density high: each sentence advances image or motive. One mixed moment—“ground gave way” + “unnatural strength”—slightly muddles causality, but clarity survives.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef + coral regret-vault is a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Dream logic and culinary alchemy transform familiar redemption arc. Specificity of salt-crystal cartography and bioluminescent coral anchors the fantastical. Risk is moderate; payoff justifies it.</comment>
