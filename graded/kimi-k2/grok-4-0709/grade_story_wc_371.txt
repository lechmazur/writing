<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet guilt and gentle resolve are embodied in tactile micro-choices (crumbling bread, testing soil). The contradiction between passive watching and active redemption is held in scene, not summary. Final renunciation—accepting tenuous absolution—carries visible cost as he kneels amid the mosaic. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard’s shift from normalized decay to revealed sacredness reweights Elias’s guilt. Causal chain—bread memory → guerrilla act → mosaic uncloaking—tightens options and meaning. Cost is legible in the kneeling image and the lingering scent of vanished ovens. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Overgrown palace, weathered pavilion, and bread’s yeasty scent are filtered through Elias’s selective attention. The mosaic’s exposed birds constrain his next act and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; vines and cracked fountains track across beats. Environment subtly guides every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming apathy into awe—escalates via each guerrilla seed planted. One decisive tightening: uncloaking the mosaic forces a public reckoning with neglect. Cost is the irreversible exposure of his family’s failure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: bread, seeds, mosaic. No explicit moralizing; the sacred is revealed through tending ruins. Final image of winter courtyard holding secret warmth offers non-literal answer to “redemption in the ordinary.” Subtext operates in silence and scent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual bias—yeast memory, soil give, faded azure wings. No head-hopping; distance tightens under pressure. Diction is spare yet lyrical, matching his heuristic gentleness. Rhythm modulates with dusk’s hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is sparse and precise—“living shroud,” “faint yeast”—never muddling action. High information density without clutter. Final line crystallizes scent and silence into charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “ruins reclaimed” trope is refreshed through guerrilla gardening and a vanished bakery’s bread as relic. Specificity of mosaic birds and heirloom seeds grounds the concept. Risk taken in quiet lyric mode pays off in resonant closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
