<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prophet’s interiority is vivid—eyes “like polished sea glass,” kelp-tangled beard—but motivation (“turn obstacles into instruments”) is stated more than embodied; the final choice to compose rather than flee is earned yet cost is abstract. No contradictory impulses shown mid-scene; emotional arc is steady rather than layered. Single POV holds; no second character on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide harmonizes with the orchard’s song, a visible before/after shift. Causal chain—cloud reading → fractal sketches → dubbed music → tide tamed—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchored by line 3. Cost is conceptual (restless euphony resolved) but felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is immersive: salt-tolerant apple trees bobbing like notes, driftwood lashed by vines. Micro-setting (whalebone mallet, etched planks) constrains the final composition. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and motion; spatial choreography coherent. No driftwood count or physics slips.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard’s survival against leeward tide—signaled early. Escalation via tide’s approach tightens options; prophet’s agency drives the turn from threat to symphony. Cost is the abstract surrender of control to harmony, legible in final image. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-art emerges organically from prophet’s actions; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in fractal patterns as both beauty and survival tool. Final image reweights premise: chaos becomes orchestra. Complexity embraced without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“clouds gathered in fractaled whorls,” “apples bobbed like notes on a staff.” Perceptual signature distinct; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no register drift. Compression purposeful; no dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern. Minor loop: “fractal” overused 3× in 40 words mid-scene (−0.2). No mixed metaphors or clarity breaks. Final paragraph cadence crystallizes closure effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating orchard orchestra is fresh; trope of weather-mage transformed into sound-sculptor. Fractal music concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyrical mode pays off. No derivative echoes. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
