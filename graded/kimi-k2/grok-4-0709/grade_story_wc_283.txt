<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eland’s interiority—“quiet rebellion against fate”—is specific and active, contradictions visible in tension between solitary duty and need for shared wisdom. Cost arrives when he chooses to catalog his own memory (the tarnished button) rather than only others’, locking the climax to prior cause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds from first tremors to closing cliff groan; causality is present but lyrical. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Eland reverses the hourglass, but the cliffs physically release rather than collapse—cost crystallized in the jar he seals anew, knowing wisdom must be left behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Warehouse and amber walls function as micro-setting, constraining Eland’s movement and sight-lines; the canyon echo reverberates against glowing walls, charging the final harmonic release. Orientation anchor (“amber warehouse beneath the cliffs”) appears in first paragraph; spatial scale is consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominate stake is crystalized early: cliffs collapsing in prophecy. Tension escalates through rising tremors and progressive clarity of the echo; the catalog of buttons tightens until the final reversal reshapes destiny itself—price paid in personal story embedded in the buttons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through accumulation rather than statement: prophecy transformed from doom to woven possibility via shared human stories. No moralizing, yet ending reframes the amber slab from immutable fate to malleable fabric. Final resonance: silence unearthed is a silence full of future listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical but precise, shifting registers to mirror escalating tension—from languid amber glow to urgent button sorting. Word choice and syntax stay within plausible artisan lexicon, never drifting into abstraction. Sensory filter stays consistent, grounded in Eland’s tactile cataloging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured and propulsive, no loops detected. Occasional elevated diction (“incoherent murmurings from the earth’s own voice”) aligns with mythic register. Information density high: e.g., lines 3–4 compress history of fossilized amber and present reverberation without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—warehouse of time-governing amber plus prophecy unscrambled by humble buttons—feels refreshingly non-obvious. The button-catalog trick is grounded; no borrowed mythology. Specificity of wax-sealed sound as key device heightens risk without gimmickry.</comment>
