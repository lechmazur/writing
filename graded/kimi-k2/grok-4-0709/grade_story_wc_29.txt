<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“hands trembled slightly,” “quiet, cautious smile”), but the cosmic-trickster motive is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to broadcast interference is earned yet the cost feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from taunting signal → decoding charts → calibrating emitter → crowd calming. Closure lands on-page with a visible shift in the protest and a felt vigilance in Elara, satisfying the cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The basement station is tactile—“sticky dials,” “ozone from sparking wires”—and the antenna tower reappears in the final image, constraining her reach and charging the last beat. Selective sensory detail mirrors Elara’s narrowed focus under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community fracture) is signaled early and tightened when tonight’s protest is targeted; Elara’s interference narrows options and forecloses the tricksters’ immediate escalation. Cost is legible in her lingering vigilance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of manipulated belief emerges organically from the signal-decoding plot; the ending’s quiet reconfiguration invites reflection without moralizing. A touch more ambiguity about the tricksters’ reality would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and filtered through Elara’s scientific precision—“vector,” “subsonic frequencies”—without jargon overload. Rhythm modulates with tension, and no POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“ethereal grit,” “galactic board”) edges toward overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-trickster premise is familiar, yet grounding it in a campus radio station and subsonic mood control gives fresh, specific inflection. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent; transformation is evident.</comment>
