<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s blitheness is embodied in humming and gentle pruning, but the interior contradiction—cheerfulness against spectral regret—never fully collides in a micro-choice; the final act of placing the case is tender yet feels pre-ordained rather than wrestled with. Motivation to “discover the shape of intentions” is clear, but the cost is more spectral than personal, softening the earned edge needed for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silo absorbs the released echoes, and Elias’s dawn placement of the case crystallizes a before/after of redeemed silence. Causal chain (find → decode → lead grave → release) is intact under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the tapestry’s map is the single tightening beat. Cost is felt in the hush after crescendo, though it could be sharper on Elias himself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The cobalt silo’s curved walls literally amplify sound, turning whispers into symphonies and guiding Elias’s decoding; the grave of forget-me-nots reprises the tender organization motif. Sensory selection is biased by Elias’s gardener eye—loamy soil, velvet shadows—anchoring place without catalog. Micro-setting (tapestry on crate) constrains the decoding action, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncovering buried intentions—tightens once when the tapestry map points to the unmarked grave; agency is Elias’s methodical untangling that forecloses mystery. Pressure escalates via spectral voices rising in volume, a clear Accumulative intensification. Cost is vicarious (lovers’ regret) more than personal, keeping it just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption through remembrance emerges from the tapestry’s decoded apology and the gardener’s act of re-interment; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in the frayed threads and the silo’s echoing hush. Final image of dawn light on the case reweights the “velveteen gloom” into quiet absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with velveteen/cobalt/starlight motifs woven through syntax that mirrors Elias’s gentle cadence. Compression is purposeful—no filler between discovery and decoding. Perceptual signature is gardener-patient, noticing soil texture and thread tension alike. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical but avoids purple excess; each figurative phrase (“winds that carried secrets,” “threads frayed like unraveling thoughts”) advances atmosphere or stakes. Rhythm modulates with tension—long sentences during discovery, clipped fragments as voices swell. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One mixed metaphor (“jagged silhouettes in the night”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic notes—midnight cemetery, buried regret—are refreshed through the gardener’s blithe POV and the tapestry-as-cipher device. The sovereign case’s transformation from coin-holder to echo-vessel is a fresh inflection. Risk lies in lyric density, but coherence holds. Could edge higher with a sharper personal stake.</comment>
