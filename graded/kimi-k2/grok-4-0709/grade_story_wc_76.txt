<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven compulsion is embodied in tactile micro-choices—trembling fingers, counter-clockwise turns—yet the interior contradiction between hope and dread stays vivid. The final renunciation (“if this victory was merely another illusion”) lands with earned cost, though the family backstory is slightly over-summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from yoyo discovery → reverse-engineering → hunger stone ignition → beam inversion. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the reversed beam spirals inward, time hesitates, and Elias steps beyond fate while acknowledging possible illusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, seabed, and workshop are filtered through Elias’s precise, clock-maker gaze; kelp, barnacles, and gear teeth all constrain movement and tool use. The hunger stone’s glow recharges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—undo the shipwreck—is signaled early and tightened by each reverse-tick of the clocks. The final activation forecloses retreat: the beam reverses, tide pauses, and Elias pays with existential uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of time’s irreversibility versus human defiance emerges through concrete mechanics rather than statement. The hunger stone’s famine warning reweights the victory into possible curse, achieving conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, metallic, yet haunted. Syntax mirrors clockwork precision (“neatly inventive twist”) and emotional fracture (“bleak exhilaration”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or causality. Minor register elevation in “inexorable” is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The counter-clockwise clock maker reversing time via a rune-etched yoyo and famine stone feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk-taking (time reversal without tidy confirmation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
