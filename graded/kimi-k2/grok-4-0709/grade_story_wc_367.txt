<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s interiority is vivid—her “shadowed elation” and embodied laughter anchor her spectral presence—but the story never tests her motivation against a live obstacle; her choices remain ritualistic rather than adaptive, so the arc feels circular, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blackout prophecy crystallizes cost, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of light and shadow reweights the stake. The ritual sequence is coherent, though causality between laugh and blackout is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass wick, and starfield are rendered with tactile specificity; the wick’s optics constrain Elowen’s method and charge the final image. Spatial anchors are immediate; only the “digital world” remains a vague backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reshaping society via recovered shadows—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as light amplifies, but the cost is conceptual (future blackout) rather than felt on-page; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming communal memory from digital amnesia emerges through the ritual’s imagery without overt statement. The final silhouettes of “shared newspapers” reweight prior shadows, offering quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; diction (“spectral remnants,” “ink in water”) feels character-bound. No dialogue, but free-indirect texture sustains POV. Occasional syntactic grandeur skirts purple but stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering rarely stalls momentum. A few near-repeats (“ancient shadows,” “shadowed elation”) echo rather than loop. Strong cadence control under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fusing spectral lighthouse keeper with optic-engineered shadow-weaving feels fresh; the print-newspaper elegy is specific, not generic. Risky lyricism pays off in the final image’s reconfiguration.</comment>
