<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—solitude vs. alliance—remains embodied and specific; the final renunciation of pursuit carries visible cost in the emptied tube and fading pigeon. Micro-choices (unfastening, refastening, whispering) reveal hierarchy of values. No stock phrasing; voice stays coherent. Only the “shadow” follower remains off-page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias refuses the invitation, sealing solitude with the pigeon’s departure; cost is legible in the re-fastened empty tube. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of storm imagery and solitude deepens until final charged poise. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Courtyard, dusk, jasmine, and ivy walls are filtered through Elias’s meteorologist gaze; the fountain and pigeon tube become micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy (damp earth, distant thunder) mirrors internal tension. Final image of zone’s glow on horizon reweights earlier calm. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity vs. intervention—signaled early; pressure tightens when coordinates tempt alliance. One decisive tightening: refusal to follow the message, paid with solitude’s cost. Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Agency clear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of integrity amid chaos emerges from Elias’s choices and storm records, never stated. Final image of empty tube and distant glow reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in pigeon’s “weary eyes” and Elias’s whispered encouragement. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—precise meteorological diction, lateral associations, measured syntax—remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. Rhythm modulates with tension. Dialogue absent, so no voice convergence. Compression and elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language purposeful (“storms recorded faithfully, one intuitive step at a time”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports cadence. Minor filter verbs (“he sensed”) do not dull immediacy. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm recorder as monk of data, rogue zone as sentient weather. Folklore and ley lines woven organically. Risk in quiet refusal ending pays off. No derivative echoes; premise transformed through Elias’s specific vocation and solitude.</comment>
