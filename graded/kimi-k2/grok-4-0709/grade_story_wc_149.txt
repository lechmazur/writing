<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “shadowed embers” eyes and the bead’s pulse in his palm anchor us—but the ghost bride’s choices remain off-stage; her “lovingly venomous” guidance never forces a micro-choice from Elias that visibly costs him until the final beat. The debt’s emotional weight is felt, yet the bride’s agency is spectral summary rather than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s stillness and Elias’s “mournful elation” crystallize the cost of love repaid. Causal chain is lyric-accumulative; each cameo tightens the orchard’s awakening and saps Elias’s vitality, but the ghost’s vanishings rely on poetic ellipsis rather than because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass fogged with “enchanted fruits” and the bead’s carved runes create a micro-setting that literally channels spectral energy; the final thaw spreading “in hushed waves” recharges the initial frost. Spatial anchors are clear, sensory bias is Elias’s, and the orchard’s transformation is causally tied to the bead’s glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—lifetimes-old debt—escalates as each cameo awakens more trees at visible cost to Elias’s stamina. One meaningful tightening: the bride’s final “debt is repaid” dissolves her and completes the orchard’s bloom, foreclosing reunion. Pressure is coherent under lyric-accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of love as both poison and salvation emerges through the “lovingly venomous” motif and the toxic-healing blossoms; no moral is stated. The ending’s “mournful elation” reweights the orchard’s glow as both triumph and bereavement, inviting reflection without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined—“vines twisted like forgotten spells,” “moonlit venom”—and sustains a consistent alchemist’s cadence. No POV drift; even the ghost’s speech is filtered through Elias’s perception. Compression in final paragraph tightens rhythm to match the vanishing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“frost-laced evening,” “wilted roses”) risk purple tint yet serve the enchanted register. No loops, clean grammar, and the final image’s hush lands without clutter. One mixed metaphor—“false dawn illusioned the horizon”—slightly jars.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard + ghost-bride debt is a fresh synthesis; the bead as conduit for spectral resonance avoids cliché. Risk lies in lyric excess, but the specificity of “venomous beauty” blossoms and inherited karmic debt feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
