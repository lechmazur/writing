<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—elegant manipulator vs. would-be truth-teller—drives every beat; the moment he threads the puppet-self to the stick crystallizes the cost of his reversal. Lena’s absence is felt as pressure, not device. The serene mask never slips, yet the embodied tremor in his ink-stained fingers shows the strain. One more dramatized micro-choice under fire would have lifted this to 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the campfire stick becomes wand and constraint, the dome’s hush now charged with ethical cost. Causal chain holds—argument → doubt → inversion of craft → puppet plan—without gaps. Orientation is swift; the radar dome anchors by line 3. One tightening beat suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dome’s fractured moonlight and geodesic ribs filter every choice; the campfire stick’s charred tip is micro-setting that constrains gesture and meaning. Sensory selection is urgent—echoes, creaks, meteor hush—never decorative. Final image of moonlit marionette threads dome acoustics into the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. profitable deceit—is signaled in Lena’s shouted accusation and tightened when Elias threads the puppet-self. One meaningful deepening: from elegant lies to subversive truth-telling, with visible cost (loss of patron income, risk of seedy-bar backlash). Agency is decision, not luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Elias’s embodied struggle rather than statement; the half-lit epiphany motif reweights from manipulative gloss to raw honesty. Final image of moonlit puppet rehearsal offers non-literal answer: art can expose its own deceit. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is urbane yet tactile—“ink-stained fingers,” “meteor hush”—with rhythmic control that breathes under pressure. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices angles of moonlight as calligraphic strokes. One near-cliché (“cosmic dust”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, motive, and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent—“fractured patterns,” “meteor hush.” One mixed metaphor (“quiet starfall”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: decommissioned Cold-War dome as confessional theater, calligraphy inverted into puppet subversion. Risky, yet every detail is grounded and inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
