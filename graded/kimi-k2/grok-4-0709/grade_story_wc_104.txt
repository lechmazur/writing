<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation to safeguard the seeds despite physical restraint is consistent, embodied through micro-choices (wrist-shuffle, finger-cipher). Interiority lacks over-therapy yet roots in prior off-page history without more contradiction shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: each decoded key leads in sequence to vault activation, paid with literal chains and looming looters. Closure delivers felt cost—barriers self-seal, canvas collapses—legible under narrowed lens of impeding to protect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prize-booth corpse of stuffed bears and tilted piano bench anchor spatial clarity early. Setting constrains movement (counter chain, hidden slot) and supplies usable cipher, charging the final image of funhouse dips swallowing pursuers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—keep vault seeds from looters—governs rising pressure of invasion footsteps. Tightening arrives as final key turn forecloses his own escape path, sealing tunnels with visible, self-inflicted closure cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from seed-to-resilience arc without sermon: the future is born of patient defiance, dramatized in chained captor who unchains tomorrow. Final green-shoot vision reweights prior destruction imagery without direct thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is Elias’s perceptual filter: tactile study of micro-engravings, taste of iron on wrists, auditory crunch of looters’ boots. Compression (patterned “staggering grace” tether) modulates with stress and is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose reads aloud with controlled cadence; high-density metaphors (DNA-fletched arrow) never stall momentum. No paraphrase loops, no filter-thought stacks. One line of reportage-speak (“looters disguised as liberators”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Binds archetype (liberator enchained) to fresh kernel: carnival lock-step as decoding crucible for heritage seeds. Transformation survives name/place swap; combination feels inevitable and specific, risk of lyric density supports rather than girds.</comment>
