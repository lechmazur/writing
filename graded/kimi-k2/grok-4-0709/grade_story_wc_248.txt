<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s guilt vs guardian’s love—are embodied in trembling fingers and volcanic sobs; the final sketching beat crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Motivation stays rooted in Mira’s deathbed promise, intensifying through each artistic breadcrumb. Interiority is specific (“analytically intuitive” mind as forge) and avoids label-speak. Only the off-stage Mira keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s fire redefined from destruction to preservation, cost paid in weeping recognition. Causal chain—relief → mosaic → portrait → tapestry → full sketch—tightens options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift. One transition (surface to chamber) is seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Archive corridors, alcove, chamber form a micro-setting that constrains movement and discovery; the charcoal from Elias’s pack becomes tool-as-setting. Sensory detail is selective (crumbling stone, faded tiles, gouged canvas) and filtered through Elias’s analytical gaze. Final tapestry fragment charges the closing image. Slight over-reliance on visual keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise—tightens when each artwork forces Elias deeper; the portrait’s gouged eyes escalate internal cost. One decisive turn: choosing to portray the tapestry’s missing design, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of fire-as-purification emerges from concrete acts and images; no moralizing. Final tableau of lovers amid erupting mountains reweights the arson as necessary rebirth. Subtext in vandalized eyes and slashed canvas speaks louder than exposition. Complexity lingers: destruction and preservation entwined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—analytical yet lyric, volcanic yet tender—consistent in diction and rhythm. Compression (“tender as lava cooling into fertile earth”) teaches the pattern early. No dialogue, so no register clash. Psychic distance stays tight; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers insight and image. Occasional elevated phrasing (“volcanic tenderness”) is earned by voice. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere. One mixed metaphor (“simmering passion beneath calm exterior, tender as lava”) barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist as guardian via artistic archaeology. Familiar tropes—lost civilization, deathbed promise—are transformed through tactile artifacts and reversed fire symbolism. Specificity of chisel-mark analysis and tapestry reconstruction anchors originality. Risk-taking in lyric structure pays off.</comment>
