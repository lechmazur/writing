<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession with what trees witness is embodied in tactile micro-choices—kneeling for the sextant, aligning its lens, aching hands—yet interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “mundane miracle” rhetoric rather than raw contradiction. The final renunciation (pocketing the sextant and resuming work) is earned, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally stinging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured degree of sorrow layers density until the map pulses, reconfiguring Elias’s stance toward the labyrinth. Closure lands as Charged Poise—moonlit map glowing, his own grief beginning to knit—yet the felt cost is more atmospheric than viscerally priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stormlit tower is no backdrop; its wooden veins, moonlit corridors, and creaking beams actively supply the sorrow Elias quantifies, constraining every dial-turn. Micro-setting (the alcove’s pooled mercury light) charges the final image when the map glows in resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the trees’ witness—tightens when Elias realizes he must deconstruct sorrow to reach it. One clear deepening: mapping grief shifts from curiosity to personal healing, with the cost of laborious precision etched in aching hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through concrete particulars—sap like tears, rings like grief arcs—without moralizing. Final image of moonlight knitting brass and heart alike offers resonant, non-literal answer to how loss endures and transforms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, storm-tinged, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every beam and splinter through Elias’s arbor-centric worldview. Compression (“moonlight pooled like spilled mercury”) is taught early and paid off in the glowing map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, each sentence layering sorrow’s measure or timber’s whisper. Occasional lyrical surplus (“mundane miracle” twice) nudges overwriting but never stalls momentum or muddies closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Quantifying sorrow with a sextant that heals in moonlight is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the device’s revival and use feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
