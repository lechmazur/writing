<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning to open the vial yet fearing its grief—drives every beat; the final kneel and sob crystallize a credible renunciation of avoidance with visible cost. The aromatic caution trait is embodied (hesitant inhalations, trembling fingers), not labeled. Only minor slip: “wiser now” edges toward tidy epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias seals the vial, accepting perpetual grief rather than erasing it; the cost is the tear-stained moment he now carries forward. Causal chain holds: orchid blooms → scent triggers memory → vial opened → grief faced → vial resealed. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s humid air, ultraviolet script, and orchid’s luminescent veins actively constrain Elias’s choices—he must kneel amid the pollen patterns to grieve. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; no static cataloguing. Micro-setting (the vial’s facets under UV) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why smells trigger tears—tightens once: the orchid’s bloom forces the confrontation. Escalation is accretive: scent intensifies → memories flood → collapse. Cost is legible in the sob that “shook his frame.” Could edge higher if the trade-off (sealing vial = carrying pain) were more explicit earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the orchid’s resurrection paralleling Elias’s emotional revival; no moralizing. The final image of sealing the vial reweights the premise: memory’s scent is both wound and lantern fuel. Subtext in the mother’s etched line avoids overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“petals unfurled slowly… tears welled”). Perceptual signature is consistent—botanical lexicon, scent-driven memory. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“aromatically cautious”) fits the lantern-broker persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, memory, and action. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“crystal shadows,” “genetic whispers”) serve rather than obscure. One mixed image—“orchid grieved its own extinction”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Combining extinct-plant resurrection with scent-memory grief is fresh; the vial-as-lantern concept synthesizes tropes organically. Risk in lyric density pays off. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without the orchid’s specific bloom and the vial’s inscription.</comment>
