<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-driven micro-choices (carving, pressing the handle to the bob) are embodied and escalate under pressure; the final integration of confessions into the clock’s rhythm earns a credible renunciation of secrecy with visible cost—the inscriptions fade, their essence absorbed—yet the interior contradiction between haste and diligence is more summarized than dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendulum’s resumed swing reweights the village’s stalled harmony, the cost etched into the brass. Causal linkage holds—each inscription incrementally releases guilt until Elias acts—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; the pause in the pendulum’s arc is the taught pattern that pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge, clock tower, and brass bob are vivid, selective, and constrain choice: the ridge’s shadow times the fishermen, the bob’s polished surface mirrors Elias’s turmoil and later absorbs the inscriptions. Micro-setting (rake handle as confessional relic) charges the final image. One hairline slip: “heat miraged off the obsidian” edges toward cliché, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal balance through personal absolution—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias realizes the bob’s pause equals the village’s fracture. The decisive act (transferring inscriptions) narrows options: secrecy is foreclosed, guilt is externalized. Cost is visible—the handle’s faded carvings mark forfeiture—though the escalation is single-note, not multi-turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from Elias’s tactile acts; no moralizing. The final image—the pendulum swinging while the village below subtly heals—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how shared balance is restored. Subtext in the etched regrets and mirrored brass deepens without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“searing reverie,” “incrementally releasing”). Perceptual signature—Elias’s clock-winder precision—filters every detail. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; internal monologue stays within lexicon. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he saw… he felt”) near the memory flash prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and read-aloud clean; figurative language is purposeful (“pendulum… metronome of fate”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“latent power,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds Elias’s likely idiom, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of clockwork, guilt, and tidal ritual feels inevitable and fresh; the rake-handle-as-confessional is a non-obvious device that transforms a mundane tool into a moral ledger. Risk in the lyric, accumulative structure pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes.</comment>
