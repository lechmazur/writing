<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory gift and ambition collide in embodied micro-choices (planting the seed, inhaling the stench). The final renunciation of conquest for “quiet undercurrents” is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (the village’s repulsion, her own nausea). Minor slip: the grandmother backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly diluting the family-custom payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corpse-flower’s stench reweights the village’s fear into adaptation, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost (“strange purity” amid revulsion). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each journal entry and doodle layers density until the final image reconfigures meaning. No causality breaks; the seed’s payoff is seeded early and paid late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treetop village is more than postcard: swaying bridges, mist, and the seed’s suspended pot constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara’s nose filters every detail. Micro-setting (the aerie hut, the pot) functions as setting that alters tactics. One minor drift: “wildflower hush” is lovely but risks overwriting if repeated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning collective fear into hopeful adaptation—is signaled early and tightened through Elara’s experiment. The corpse-flower’s eruption forces a public test; the village’s decision to stay carries visible social cost. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of serenity within motion emerges organically from Elara’s experiment and the village’s choice, never stated didactically. The corpse-flower’s paradox (death attracting life) reweights the premise in the final image. Subtext in the doodled wrappers quietly reframes past as map for inner peace. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the “eternal sway.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to stench without losing clarity. Perceptual signature is consistent: every scent note is filtered through Elara’s vocation and mood. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays clean. Minor elevation in diction (“cadaverous odor”) fits the heightened moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors or purple stacks. One paraphrase loop (“serenity within motion” echoed twice) is minor. Final image crystallizes without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: corpse-flower as catalyst for communal adaptation, journal-doodles as ancestral tech for inner mapping. Tropes (ambitious herbalist, mystical village) are transformed through sensory specificity and communal stakes. Risk in lyric mode pays off—the hush-to-stench arc heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
