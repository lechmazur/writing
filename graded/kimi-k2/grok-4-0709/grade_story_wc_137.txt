<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s skeptical kindness is embodied in every micro-choice—her steady hands on the tile, the deliberate inhale before she risks belief—yet the interior contradiction between doubt and care is dramatized rather than labeled. The final renunciation of pure skepticism is earned by the causal chain of memory-transcription and carries a visible cost: Kai’s memories are now visitable but forever separate. Only the brother remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible is not tested; the score caps at 8.7.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile’s final pulse reweights Elara’s stance from doubt to wonder, and the cost—memories now distinct yet forever beyond physical reach—is legible in the last image of her lighter descent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases until the unheard symphony resolves into peaceful resonance. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tower’s open dome, etched star-maps, and migrating whales constrain Elara’s ritual timing and supply the celestial alignment that unlocks the tile. Sensory selection is urgent—wind chill, stone’s worn grooves, whales’ subsonic tremor—filtered through her skeptical attention. The final image of silhouetted whales against moonlit waves recharges the opening vista with new emotional weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—untangling entangled memories—tightens once when the tile’s patterns bloom and force Elara to choose between safe doubt and risky kindness. The cost is the irreversible separation of memories; agency is hers, not coincidence. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of transcription: belief as an ethical kindness rather than intellectual surrender. The whales’ unheard symphony becomes a non-literal answer—wonder accepted without proof—delivered through image, not statement. No final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during pattern-tracing and breathes at closure. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices mathematical symmetries before emotional ones, hears whale song as “inaudible yet profound.” No dialogue, so voice evaluation is internal coherence only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without redundancy. Metaphors (“patterns like forgotten constellations”) are fresh and internally consistent. Zero loops or scaffold; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The synthesis of magic-square mathematics with grief-work feels inevitable and specific; the trope of “magic object reveals truth” is transformed through skeptical kindness rather than wish-fulfilment. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reweighted image.</comment>
