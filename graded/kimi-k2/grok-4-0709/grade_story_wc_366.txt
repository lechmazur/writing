<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and “warmly observant” trait are embodied in micro-choices—stacking stones, selecting sea glass, kneeling amid ghosts—yet interior contradiction remains muted; the ache is named more than dramatized. Motivation (“bottle the feeling of safety”) drives every beat, but the cost feels generalized rather than personally stinging at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: anonymous chain → lamp failure → stone ritual → quiet release. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lamp relights, but the gentler glow of the chain persists, reconfiguring the ghosts’ ache and Elias’s duty. Orientation is immediate; no causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Whispering Rock Isle, the lantern room, and the stone cairns are rendered through Elias’s practiced eye—salt-etched glass, pebbled shore, spectral outlines—each detail constraining his tactile ritual. Micro-setting (the seven-stone tower) becomes the final charged object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: extend the chain’s safety to the haunted. Escalation is a single deepening—lamp outage intensifies the ghosts’ ache, forcing Elias’s ritual. Agency is renunciation/continuation: he gives the chain to the dead, not just the living, at visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through image rather than statement: safety as portable, fragile, communal. The sea glass migrates from anonymous gift to ghostly balm, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the stones’ wind-whispers and the ghosts’ wordless reach.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is maritime, weather-wise, reticent. Syntax is spare yet rhythmic—“the way the waves curled like secrets”—matching his quiet precision. No dialogue, so voice is carried by filtered perception and ritual action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive; occasional lyric lifts (“luminescent ache”) earn their place. No loops, no scaffold, strong verbs. Metaphors are consistent—sea glass as bottled twilight—without muddle. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse-ghost trope is refreshed by the anonymous stone-message chain and the transfer of safety to the dead. Specificity of maritime ritual and tactile detail elevates the premise above cliché. Risk is modest but execution feels inevitable.</comment>
