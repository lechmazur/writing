<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is vividly embodied (curled “like dried petals”), his interior contradiction (preserve vs. wither) is active in every beat, and the final micro-choice—releasing the raw-truth message—rings from prior build. Still, his shift toward “sharing not hiding” is articulated rather than enacted; the cost reads as declared rather than lived on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure reaches a legitimate Charged Poise: the return of Aria with a reply crystallizes Elias’s narrowed options—he is now “balancing on the edge of hope and despair.” The meteorite, the mapping ritual, and the paper trails all converge in that single charged moment. A fractional deduction because the friend’s reply happens off-page; the moment remains felt yet partly secondhand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Attic’s single skylight constricts both vision and freedom; the book-stacks form literal barriers he must weave paper trails around. Sensory density is selective—paper scent, dust motes, meteorite coolness—filtered through avian courier priorities. Meteorite pendant and pigeon cage serve as micro-settings that tighten final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Central stake—will he ever transmit honest song—tightens precisely once via sending the un-reinvented message. Meteorite and dust-mote mapping are persistent constraints that alter tactics rather than solve obstacles. Cost is visible in his “withering fear giving way” though the actual price remains internal rather than external.</comment>

<comment>Theme blooms quietly: preservation lies in sharing rather than hoarding. The refrain of withered vs. blooming loops from pigeons to paper to heart-garden without ever naming its moral. Final image of trails “intertwining” reweights earlier secrecy without overt statement; a hint of sentimentality (“tears bloomed”) keeps it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<comment>Voice maintains consistent diction—antiquarian, bird-centric, wounded romantic. Syntax modulates: longer incantatory sentences during “mapping chaos,” clipped fragments before release. One near-lapse into elevated therapy-speak (“bloom and wither cycle”) slightly dulls immediacy but recovers quickly.</comment>

<comment>Prose is textured and mostly precise; however there is moderate figurative density in the “swirl of dust motes as constellations” strand across multiple sentences, and a minor scaff-fold loop (“each one…each one”). Neither artifact touches the closure unit, so penalty remains light.</comment>

<comment>Pigeon-courier in dusty attic + healing via alien meteorite + dust-mote star maps gives a rare synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. The reinvention lies in literalizing “paper trails” as breadcrumb-loops through labyrinth shelves—not a novelty gimmick but an organic constraint. Minor deduction only because the friend’s reply remains generic.</comment>
