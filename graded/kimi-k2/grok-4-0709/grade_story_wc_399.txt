<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elar’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority is mostly abstract ("wisdom echoes," "quiet triumph") rather than embodied. The final choice to consecrate the parapet is motivated, yet the cost feels reported rather than lived. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene; the character moves with near-perfect certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parapet’s binding of wisdom’s echo creates a before/after legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—prophet’s arrival → clearings → descent → consecration. Orientation is anchored early; no drift. Cost is conceptual (wisdom anchored, Elar vanishes) but thinly felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silken pavilion, shifting sands, breathing stone parapet—details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elar’s peripheral perception. The kinetic parapet becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: prophet’s disruption → conjured clearings → parapet awakening → consecration. Agency lies in Elar’s ritual, which forecloses the path of letting wisdom fade. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation versus oblivion emerges through concrete action (consecration) rather than statement. Subtext resides in Elar’s peripheral seeing—truth grasped sideways. Final image of dunes resettling offers quiet resonance without moralizing. Some abstractions (“echoes of ancient wisdom”) edge toward pseudo-profundity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured—“starlit robes,” “whisperfield calm,” “shadows dancing just out of reach.” Perceptual signature is distinct: peripheral awareness as method. Syntax modulates with intensity; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“kinetic parapet,” “ley lines”) stays within Elar’s esoteric lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is selective; no mixed metaphors. Minor scaffold: “whispers” recurs in pavilion, prophet, and ley lines without new pressure. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph could lose one layer of summary without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar desert-mystic tropes are refreshed by peripheral perception as active method and kinetic parapet as living relic. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate—quiet consecration rather than spectacle—but stakes stay personal. Derivative echoes (“prophet descends from night sky”) remain recognizable.</comment>
