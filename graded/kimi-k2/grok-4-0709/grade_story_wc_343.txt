<comment>Elias’s curiosity drives every beat from first telescope glance to final fold of phrasebook; interior contradictions (longing vs isolation) are embodied in trembling hands and racing heart. Micro-choice—deciding to kneel and translate chalk inscriptions—alters tactics mid-scene. Renunciation of anonymity by embracing future explorers carries felt social cost ("carrying the promise of wonders yet to be charted"). No slips; curiosity never reduced to label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Causal lens holds: each beat’s therefore linkage leads from starling murmuration → hopscotch grid → multilingual translation → luminous coordinate map. Closure delivers Earned Stasis: Elias gains knowledge map yet remains airborne and socially isolated—cost legible ("The antique airship sailed into the night"). Orientation anchored by word 30; zero discontinuities.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Antique airship functions as floating observatory; hopscotch board embedded in deck physically constrains translation posture, then reappears in final chart. Starling murmuration doubles as shifting sky-map itself. Micro-setting triumphs: deck texture (dust on palms) and faint auroral light guide map choices. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake is explicit yet grows: “to chart the next great discovery.” Pressure tightens one turn: translation of hopscotch marks → tangible map. Agency propels escalation; no coincidence rescue. Cost is felt final image: alone with map in gondola night—social currency spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from specifics: lonely pursuit of knowledge vs communal sharing of skies. Stranded luminance reweights from mere atmospheric detail to moral imperative for future cartographers. Final sentence delivers quiet conceptual repricing without sermonizing. Earned ambiguity around solitude retains complexity.</answer>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature via map apprentice’s selective noticing (astronomical detail, tool heft). Prose modulates under wonder and urgency, rhythm tightening during translation sprint. No head-hop; single POV disciplined. Phrasebook Latin-Arabic sky-nomad blend handled consistently.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose propels rather than pads: each sentence layers action, description, and character goal. Filter verbs minimal and voice-driven (“Elias’s notes filled pages”). Micro-specificity (“brass telescope… dog-eared phrasebook”) sharpens without clutter. No loops or metaphors muddle peak beats. Clean grammatical ride.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of starling murmuration + multilingual hopscotch + “stranded luminance” feels novel yet inevitable. Ancient map trope repurposed through linguistic decoding game; payoff not twist but deepening. Specificity (bird glow, chalk dialects) prevents template feel. Risk (quiet closure) rewarded with lingering aftereffect.</question>
