<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eron’s calm is embodied in micro-choices—silent breaths, zigzag steps, the steady reel—so the renunciation at the end carries felt cost. Interior contradiction is muted; we sense longing but not simultaneous competing impulses, keeping him just shy of 9-band depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the release of the orb reweights the premise—possession is not fulfillment—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of resumed sleepwalk and mending patterns crystallizes the cost without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden, rail spike, and sleepwalking constellations are vivid, selective, and directly constrain tactics; the spike pierces the intangible, the constellations spotlight the target. One more sensory anchor in the body (heartbeat, breath) would have nudged 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture vs. release of the goddess-echo—tightens once when Eron hooks and then frees it. The cost is visible (loss of possession), but the pressure curve is gentle; a sharper mid-scene trade-off would have lifted the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communion over possession emerges organically from Eron’s final choice; no moralizing line intrudes. The feral lullaby motif reweights from threat to benediction in the release, achieving resonance without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the garden’s pulses. Occasional elevated diction (“transliterates emotions”) edges toward register drift but remains consistent with the mythic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. One mixed metaphor—“hooked something intangible yet real”—momentarily blurs physics, a hairline slip that keeps it just below 9-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of fishing, sound-garden, and sleepwalking constellations feels inevitable in hindsight; no close genre analogues. The risk of a non-causal, accumulative design pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
