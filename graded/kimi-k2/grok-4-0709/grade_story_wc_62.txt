<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his obsession with grief’s shape is embodied in the chisel, the ribbon, the circling steps—but the mentor’s guidance is too expository and the final shift to abstract carving feels slightly unearned, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop of ribbon and butterfly swarm deepens the pattern until the marble receives the new, non-literal carving. Closure lands as Charged Poise—grief reconfigured from stone to woven storm—yet the mentor’s fade-out could carry a sharper cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s dusk light, vines, and migrating butterflies are vividly selective, filtering through Elias’s perception; the ribbon physically bridges stone and air, charging the final image. One could wish for a single sensory detail that constrains the carving choice more explicitly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—discovering grief’s living shape—tightens as each circuit of ribbon and butterfly swarm intensifies the pattern; the final carving renounces inscription for abstraction, foreclosing the old method. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as migratory, collective, and poetic rather than static stone. The poem-trading custom and butterfly map weave into the final image without overt statement, though the mentor’s didactic whisper edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors the dusk thunder; POV stays tightly anchored to Elias’s perceptions. Occasional elevated phrasing (“thundering calm”) risks register drift but remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, propelling the accumulative design; only minor loops (“thundering calm” twice, “fiercely meditative” echo) and one mixed metaphor (“wings forming patterns of loss and renewal”) slightly dull the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The butterfly migration as living grief-map and the heirloom ribbon as ancestral pathfinding offer a fresh synthesis; the risk of abstraction is mostly rewarded, though the mentor’s spectral presence flirts with trope.</comment>
