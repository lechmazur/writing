<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “thistle-blown hope” and bleeding hands embody motive—but the retrocognitive gift is asserted more than tested; no moment shows its limits or cost under pressure, so the final choice feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the repaired prism ignites the beacon, reconfiguring the world for survivors. Causal chain (vision → star map → thicket retrieval) holds, though the shard’s exact agency in calming chaos is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion and wind-torn thistles are tactile and atmospheric; the pavilion’s star map physically guides the search, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clear, but the wider ruined city remains a picturesque backdrop rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—is signaled early and tightened when the shard’s recovery becomes the test. One clear escalation: aligning prism with star paths to rekindle beacon. Cost is conceptual (years of doubt) more than visceral, but still legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the prism’s journey from shattered relic to guiding light; the final beam reweights prior “coincidences” as purposeful without moralizing. Subtext in the shard’s hush is evocative, though its mythic weight is more declared than explored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation that mirrors wind and hope. Sensory filtering is character-specific; Elara notices “thorny vines” and “ethereal songs” in ways that reveal custodial vigilance. No POV drift or register slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, occasionally risking purple (“extinguished dreams,” “fragile promises of rebirth”) but never obscuring action. One paraphrase loop (“thistle-blown hope” twice in close proximity) nicks perfection; otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-keeper is familiar terrain, yet the retrocognitive archaeology and “shard of hush” offer fresh inflection. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, though the shard’s mythic properties skirt deus-ex-machina convenience.</comment>
