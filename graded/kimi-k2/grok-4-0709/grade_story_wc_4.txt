<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is consistent and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the “quiet magic of collective healing” is stated rather than dramatized as a personal risk. The final renunciation—fading into the background—earns mild resonance yet lacks a visible cost on her own heart.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural reweights communal grief into shared bonds. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photograph adds density until the cadence shift in the village square. Cost is felt in the communal exposure of pain, though Elara’s personal price remains off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender scent and rusted metal are vivid, selective, and mirrored in emotional arcs. The vines climbing the ruins function as micro-setting that constrains the timeline and charges the final image of nature reclaiming loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting communal pain—is signaled early and escalates through each villager’s micro-choice to add an arc. The mural’s completion tightens the collective stake, though the cost is borne by the group more than by Elara herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges organically from the arcs of the photographs and the vines’ slow reclamation. Final image of “mended hearts” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing, though the insight is slightly generalized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually anchored in Elara’s calm gaze. Occasional elevated diction (“transmuting our hurts into something beautiful”) edges toward the poetic but stays within her archivist register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Minor loop risk in repeated “as vines climbed” refrain, yet it serves the accumulative pattern and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival puzzle-work with communal grief ritual; the photograph-arc device feels specific and inevitable. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold structural gamble—but the concept lands coherently.</comment>
