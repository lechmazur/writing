<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet compulsion is embodied through tactile noticing and micro-choices (picking up the shard, entering the unlocked cottage). The interior contradiction—yearning to preserve wonder while fearing its erasure—drives the final ritual. The earned cost is the shared secret he now carries, a hushed burden that forecloses naïveté. One slip: “inadvertently profound” is asserted rather than dramatized in the moment of insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each displaced object layers density until the final cadence shift sanctifies the house. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s understanding reweights every prior “alive” house, and the cost is the irreversible knowledge that homes absorb souls. The shard’s journey from perfumer’s bench to ritual center is causally tracked. Orientation is anchored within the first 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bay’s spring hush and breathing cottages are filtered through Elias’s biased perception; cherry-blossom snow and lapping water constrain his stealthy approach. The orris-root shard itself becomes micro-setting, absorbing sound and guiding the ritual. Final image of the sanctified cottage recharges every sensory cue. One minor drift: “weathered docks” could be any docks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand the houses before wonder fades—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each displaced object tightens the pattern until the ritual reconfigures meaning. Agency is Elias’s deliberate gathering and arranging; the cost is the silence he now inhabits. No reversals, but the deepening is decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accretion of ordinary lives into “shards of hush”—the soul of a house. Subtext lives in gesture: the unlocked door welcoming him, the postcard’s mute foreignness. Final image reframes the entire bay as a living archive without moralizing. The insight feels earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is hushed yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the rising stillness. Sensory selection is idiosyncratic to Elias’s vocation: tide rhythms, net placement, gull-cry duration. No dialogue, so compression and lyric pattern carry the load. The perceptual signature is consistent and charged.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence layers texture or advances the ritual. Figurative language is sparse but exact—“shard of hush” is taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold. One elevated phrase—“silent inferno of revelation”—skates the edge of purple but is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The conceit of houses as accumulative souls is fresh, and the orris-root-as-silence device is specific and non-obvious. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, yet it heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
