<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her boots scrape, her palm hums, her mentor-loss fuels a credible quest. The final smile and pragmatic packing crystallize her arc without tidy epiphany. Minor: the “philosophy born from watching too many worlds crumble” edges toward summary rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s rebirth pulse reweights the tower city and her own loss into beginnings. Causal linkage holds—each discarded assumption tightens tuning until the signal resolves. Cost is felt in the gorge winds that now “whisper promises,” a visible constraint on descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted spires, creaking bridges, and lunar-lit gorge are selective, tactile, and pressure the climb. The Hollywood fragment as micro-setting constrains the final tuning and charges the closing image. One minor drift: “skeletal frameworks” is slightly generic amid otherwise sharp detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding renewal in endings—is signaled early and tightened by each discarded assumption. The shard’s pulse delivers a single, meaningful turn that forecloses despair and reconfigures options. Cost is conceptual yet legible: the mentor’s death remains irreversible, the city still ruined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges organically from Elara’s actions and the shard’s glow; no moralizing summary intrudes. The final image of winds carrying “fresh starts in every silenced echo” offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior abandonment. Avoids tidy binaries—renewal coexists with irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—pragmatic, sensorily precise, with a restrained lyric lift under lunar light. Syntax and diction remain consistent with a celestial interpreter’s trained perception. No dialogue present; internal monologue avoids filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “rusted spires clawed at the sky,” “serenely electric glow.” Rhythm modulates with ascent and tuning beats. One minor loop: “birthing gales that now carried seeds” echoes “birth” concept twice in two lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing Hollywood glamour detritus with cosmic signal work is fresh and specific; the shard’s reprise feels inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
