<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—vengeance vs. need for closure—surface in embodied micro-choices (twisting the fob, tripping the lantern). The final renunciation of open confrontation in favor of recorded betrayal carries visible cost: she forfeits direct revenge for a quieter, more haunting justice. Interiority stays concrete, though “quest for vengeance disguised as closure” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each false start tightens Thorne’s options until the planted doubt snaps the deal. Closure lands on-page—the watch fob captures the fracture, Elara slips away—cost is the unspent bullet of direct revenge. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rotting pier’s salt-stink and lantern flicker constrain movement and hide; the watch fob itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (oil fire’s hiss, crate glass underfoot) filters through Elara’s urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—escalates through three causal feints that delay Thorne’s deal. Each false start raises the risk of exposure; the final tightening forces the merchant’s recoil and the audible fracture. Cost: Elara’s forfeited chance at direct violence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust as fragile cargo emerges through the hush-truce’s rupture rather than statement. The watch fob’s antique gears echo the larger machinery of betrayal. Final image of dawn breaking over a pier “heavy with the echo of justice” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is salted noir-lyric (“moonshine runner’s daughter,” “comforting unease”) yet stays inside Elara’s perceptual limits. Syntax tightens under pressure—short beats during the fire, longer sinuous lines in retreat. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“lantern light that flickered like uneasy stars”). One paraphrase loop (“the hush endured… the hush splintering”) slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise clean, no mixed metaphors or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar pirate-market noir is refreshed by the acoustic revenge premise—capturing betrayal’s sound rather than blood. The watch-fob recorder feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks.</comment>
