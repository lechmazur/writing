<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s stoic wonder and engineer mind ring clear; her micro-decisions (re-welding valves, sighting angles) directly drive every next beat and her final stand of hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc cleanly set; because/therefore links (flood → rerouted pipes → revived hydro-system) tighten stakes and land with felt cost and earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The derelict terminal is more than backdrop—its hydro-plumbing failures and vine-choked light shafts steer every tactic; terminal star-maps charge final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the building and its promise) intensifies as each burst pipe shrinks viable options; water’s gradual redirection is one clear rise of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting hope from ruin emerges through concrete acts (redirected rain grows seed walls) without overt statement; final bioluminescent algae reprises promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Close third-person feels particular: an engineer eye tallying angles and flow rates; the quiet, precise diction remains steady even under wonder’s glow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is trim: vivid nouns and clean verbs (“choked with vines,” “bioluminescent algae stirring”) carry atmosphere without overwriting; no loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis—abandoned carnival aftermath meets spaceport archaeology—yields a non-gimmicky rejuvenation fable driven by sextant geometry and broken pipes.</comment>
