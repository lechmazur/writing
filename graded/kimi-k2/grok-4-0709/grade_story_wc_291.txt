<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s prosopagnosia and methodical nature are dramatized through his forensic sketching and tactile investigation; the final empathy awakening is earned by the ribbon’s reprise and the memorial’s cost. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tension between detachment and the felt fear he paints into Lila’s eyes. The flaw of emotional dormancy is confronted, not cured, leaving a credible residual ache.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The causal chain—ribbon → 1987 ball → Lila’s ID → portrait submission—lands a decisive change with felt cost at the memorial. Orientation is clear by line 4; the inferred lens is Causal. Closure satisfies the cost test: Elias’s softened stance and the family’s closure are legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist and damp earth constrain Elias’s movements and echo his interior fog; the ribbon’s texture and crimson color are revisited in the final portrait, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; the studio and quarry shards are anchored without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—identifying Jane Doe—tightens when the ribbon narrows the timeline to one masquerade; the portrait submission forecloses anonymity and extracts a visible social cost at the memorial. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves the case.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the unification of opposites: anonymity vs identity, detachment vs empathy. The final image of the half-removed mask offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thematic echo; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and filtered through Elias’s perceptual limits; “furrowed hush” and “lanced the core” maintain rhythmic control. No head-hopping; interior texture stays consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Minor filter-verb clusters (“he began,” “he knew”) appear but do not stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia with forensic portraiture feels fresh; the ribbon’s journey from clue to memorial centerpiece transforms a familiar cold-case trope. Specificity of the 1987 masquerade anchors the premise.</comment>
