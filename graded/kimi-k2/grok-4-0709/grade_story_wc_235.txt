<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—"feral nostalgia gnawing at my edges"—but the jealousy of past selves is summarized rather than dramatized in real time, blunting the emotional cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll becomes the vessel that converts envy into narrative, with the cost of relinquishing raw experience for crafted story legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll and candle anchor the micro-setting; the grave reappears in dream to constrain the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling foreseen death with lived freedom—tightens once when the narrator chooses to chronicle rather than relive; cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the price of narrative control is the loss of unmediated experience. Final image of the drying scroll reweights earlier freedom without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent; “jaded wonder” modulates from fatigue to reluctant awe under pressure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“timelines bleeding like ink on wet paper”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Grave-as-premise is familiar, yet the lucid-dream chronicler’s metanarrative twist feels fresh; transformation test passes—story would collapse without this specific voice and frame.</comment>
