<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's self-loathing surfaces through embodied contradictions (fierce repose vs ticking maze), but interior swings from guilt to absolution come dangerously close to therapeutic self-analysis; passivity in mid-scene could cost immersion yet micro-choices at the tapestry bench rescue legibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the decisive thread-tugging yields a Decisive Change—time restarts and Elias's chains of guilt transmute into redemption on the page with a visible gasp from villagers. Causal linkage (each unraveled thread foreshadows a trivialized queen) holds the inferred Causal lens throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Limited physical setting, yet the platinum crevasse of labyrinths and sonic-absorbing tapestry function as "environmental tools," constricting tactics and embedding cost (tactile maze burns/de-curses). Herringbone cobbles and frozen thunder are selective sensory anchors rather than decorative wallpaper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes flip from “undo the curse” to “unravel my fault”; the tapestry’s border itself turns adversary. One tightening through string-thread decoding narrows options until forgiveness becomes the only exit, generating a felt cognitive toll.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Redemption-as-self-engineering emerges organically from Elias’s maze-turned-platinum-map; no didactic moralizing. Threads whispering past regrets function as a non-literal answer (CR) that reweights queen-sacrifice into life-sacrifice hierarchy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Free-indirect style stays coherent under storm-lull punctuation; em-dashes and breathy insertions mirror chessboard thinking. POV never slips beyond Elias’s sensory envelope, and sensory verbs filter through strategic cognition (“fibers whisper like moves on a chessboard”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, concise prose with propulsive cadence; each unravel-and-clarify sentence advances either guilt pressure or closure knowledge. Only a slight filter-verb cluster (“he began to winnow”) in one line nudges rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Queen-for-life metaphor feels inevitable despite familiar redemption arc; frozen-thunder reprise queuing forgiveness is a precise, non-obvious synthesis. Risks of lyric beauty over plot substance are trimmed by visible self-lacerating cost.</comment>
