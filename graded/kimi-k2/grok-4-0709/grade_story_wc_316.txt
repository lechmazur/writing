<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—detachment vs thaw—is embodied in micro-choices (gripping the blade, placing the brain at center) rather than summary. Motivation stays rooted in trait: Kai’s numbness persists until the unified chant melts it. The final renunciation (shared identity) costs the illusion of pure autonomy—felt cost on page. Brief drift toward label-speak (“inner frost”) narrowly avoids deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant lens held cleanly: causal because/therefore linkage from clone demand → trial → vivify → integration. Closure delivered by Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged entity crystallizes options under rewritten stars with emotional thaw as visible price. No teleport props, no false restarts. Cost and change are legible at final line.</comment>

<comment>Floating stones form the ring that constrains the duel’s footwork; the rewriting sky above literalizes temporal instability. Jar and blade both evolve states mid-scene: jar shatters, blade hovers. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; only slight drift into cosmic spectacle risks white-room blur. Strong micro-setting anchors choices.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—custody of the self—escalates under each causal pivot: stakes start as ownership of legacy, tighten when trial decrees vivify must happen now, finally foreclose when only merger or annihilation remain. Agency drives every turn; no luck rescue. Emotional thaw framed as irrevocable cost.</comment>

<comment>Unity-through-tension rises organically from concrete specifics: mirror fight resolves not in domination but dialectical balance. Final image reconfigures “survival” from singular endurance to shared embodiment. Theme resists moral; numbness overcome yet individuality surrendered. No abstraction outweighs lived particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Narrator stays strictly behind Kai’s altered perceptions; perceptual signature filters cosmic detail through detached yet aching tone. Syntax mirrors split psyche—cool, clipped, then widening rhythm under heat. Dialogue carries subtext; clone’s sneer “You are but a shell” advances position more than literal insult. No POV drift.</comment>

<comment>Prose is taut: “gripped the hilt, channeling the method” does triple duty. Rhythm rises under arena pressure without purple drift. Minimal scaffolding; loops confined to thematic echo (“numbness/ice/unworthy”) serve pattern, not redundancy. No clarity obscured at closure; final cadence lands with crystalline charge.</comment>

<comment>Neural custodianship duel transposes classic doppelgänger fight but grounds it in neuro-philosophic stakes and cosmic dojo setting. Integration of Zen blade plus star-shadow weapon is fresh synthesis rather trope swap. Risk taken (merge rather than victory) elevates stakes. Derivative echoes minimal due to specificity of ego death context.</comment>
