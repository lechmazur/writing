<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s guarded-warrior interiority is vivid and embodied; the “warlike serenity” refrain threads through every beat, culminating in the unbending of her own walls. Motivation (“what mirrors don’t show”) is dramatized, not stated, and the final absorption of the confession lands as earned cost. Minor slip: the “flesh-eating seed” feels slightly external to her psyche rather than an organic extension of her flaw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake stills, the orchard quiets, and Elowen’s guardedness visibly cracks—cost is the quiet toll on her serenity. Causal chain holds: failed illusion → expanding-circle ritual → seed deployment → confession thaw → curse lift. One micro-turn (realizing she must unbend herself) tightens stakes under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cursed lake and spiraling orchard are rendered with tactile specificity—acidic fruit bursts, frozen steel water—each detail constraining movement and choice. The vortex itself becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image as it stills. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the confession to lift the curse—is signaled early and escalates through each widening circle. Agency is continuous: every probe, dodge, and planting of the seed narrows options and raises bodily risk. Cost is visible in the final “quiet toll” on her serenity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden inner truths emerges organically from the lake’s demand for revelation and Elowen’s mirrored struggle. The confession’s whisper reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—lake calmed, orchard stilled—offers a non-literal answer to “what mirrors don’t show.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, compressed, and war-serene: “soldier’s chant before dawn assault,” “blade at rest.” Syntax modulates with pressure—tight clauses under attack, longer breaths during reflection. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains Elowen’s throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“petrified admission”) edges toward register drift but stays within the druidic lexicon. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates during orchard assault and exhales at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest structure is transformed through the flesh-eating seed as both weapon and key, and the “warlike serenity” tonal fusion. The frozen confession as literalized regret feels fresh, and the orchard-vortex is a memorable micro-setting. Risky compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
