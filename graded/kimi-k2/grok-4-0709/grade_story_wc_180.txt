<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory grief-driven persistence and Lila’s anxious witness create a crucible; the quartz eyes and ribbon crystallize interior stakes. Motivation to “bridge generational wisdom” is dramatized through the mid-air retrieval of the notebook and the accidental quartz-fusion of the ribbon—visible cost on the page. Interiority stays embodied (slippery bark, swinging bag) without therapy-speak. Only the late reveal of the notebook feels slightly convenient, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused ribbon reweights “deciduous vows” from loss to cyclical renewal, felt cost in Elias’s grudging descent and Lila’s tear-bright understanding. Causal chain holds—gust dislodges bag → spill reveals notebook → shard fuses ribbon—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: how the shard embeds itself mid-fall is elided, but the image’s charge overrides the gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is no backdrop; height limits movement, apples become missiles, vines require mending. Sensory triangulation—sunlight through cracked glass, bark under fingernails, pendulum bag—anchors urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rafters to pews. The setting constrains the final choice: descent is the only safe path, making the orchard’s persistence the closing emblem.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—passing on impermanence—tightens when the notebook’s accidental fall forces Elias to enact, not preach, renewal. One meaningful deepening: the ribbon’s transformation from memento to fused artifact. Cost is visible (risky climb, shard cut, emotional exposure). Coincidence (gust) complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of cyclical vows emerges through concrete objects (ribbon, notebook, quartz) rather than statement. The final image—quartz-threaded ribbon—offers a non-literal answer: vows shed and regrow like leaves. Subtext in Lila’s smile and Elias’s wink avoids moralizing. Complexity lingers: grief remains, but its form is altered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: Elias’s feisty idiom (“Bah! Wisdom doesn’t come from safe perches”) contrasts with Lila’s tremulous urgency. Syntax mirrors physical strain—short clauses during slip, lyrical stretches in reflection. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Elias’s quartz-filtered perception. Dialogue carries subtext (notebook drop as unspoken apology).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “lush orchard spanning the rafters” marries setting and metaphor in one stroke. Rhythm accelerates during the slip, breathes during ribbon fusion. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“verdant labyrinth”) is earned by voice context. One mixed metaphor—“nurture a lush orchard”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cathedral-as-greenhouse, quartz-eye mending, deciduous vows as literal leaf-cycle. Familiar grief arc is re-angled through accidental pedagogy and artifact alchemy. Risky height setting heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: swap any element and the emotional calculus collapses.</comment>
