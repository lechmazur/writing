<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“wild theory gnawing at her mind”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; Jax’s obliging warmth is consistent yet lacks a micro-choice that alters their status. The final shared laugh lands as earned stasis, though the cost feels generalized rather than sharply personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: theory → device → lever pull → sideways proof → reversal to seal nexus. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (“proof came at a price”) and lingering constraint (“forever altering the hush”). Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent cliffs, indigo-silver vortex, and “mechanically warm” device are selective and POV-filtered. The magnetic nexus constrains the final choice by threatening to pull them sideways, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove sideways time—is signaled early and tested on-page. Escalation tightens when the lever locks and the temporal eddy threatens absorption; reversal costs the chance to explore further. Agency is clear, though the price could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of temporal multiplicity emerges through the branching holographic awakenings rather than statement. Final image of “awakenings both subdued and shared” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Jax’s gentle humor softens isolation, but thematic complexity stays safely within mid-high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent: scientific precision (“temporal readings veered laterally”) braided with lyrical warmth (“icy warmth”). Distinct perceptual signature in Elara’s cataloguing gaze. Dialogue is spare but natural; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“blanket of silence”). Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) stays within Elara’s academic lens. Final paragraph cadence crystallizes the hush effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sideways-time via magnetic nexus and alien winged creatures is a fresh synthesis; the subdued awakening motif transforms a familiar SF trope into a quiet temporal shift. Risk-taking is moderate—conceptual rather than structural—but the integration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
