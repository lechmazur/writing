<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is textured and embodied (“his breath steady despite the chill”), his motive-to-see-value seeds early, and the final rip-to-insight shows credible endurance/renunciation. Minor slips: passive voice phrases and a few stock metaphors keep it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A single, continuous scene with a clear causal arc: stone-ripple → reading → prism glow re-weight. Orientation is anchored fast, closure lands on-page (earned noctilucent image), felt cost visible in Elias’s renewed craft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pearl Bay’s micro-setting evokes body, tools, and environment (strip of sand, prism mist) that pressure choice. Mist/prism reframe the tide of light in the ending, anchoring individuality and sense memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via impending factory intrusion and Elias’s personal ticking clock; ripple-moment crystallizes his stance. One escalation beat is clean, but the off-screen threat remains abstract, slightly blunting felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Value-in-mundane theme emerges organically from glass, ripples, and mist layering. Final image reframes the “quiet wonders” as prismatic codex—subtle, non-moralizing, resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tight third-person free-indirect voice (“his mind wandered deeper”) with varied sentence rhythm matched to pressure. Perceptual signature vivid; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant rhythm, high density, zero loops. One stretch of near-generic “glowing insights” metaphors nicked 0.2, otherwise crisp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar “quiet artist vs. encroaching industry” frame is remade through glasscraft ripple-to-cosmos turn. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk tension lowers because factory menace off-page.</comment>
