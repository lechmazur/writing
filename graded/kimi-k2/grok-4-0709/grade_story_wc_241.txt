<question>1</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Interior contradiction—“calculations vs father’s chaos”—drives every micro-choice, culminating at lantern. Embodied emotion (hands pounded, pocketed sliver) balances risk & restraint convincingly. Final renunciation carries cost felt by Elara and reader. No amnesia, no tidy epiphanies.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>This is a single-scene quest; the lamp is discovery, not coincidence. Causal linkage: graffiti → mica lantern → library moment re-weights “traverse responsibly” to “teach by example” with earned constraint. Closure as Charged Poise forecloses both statistical purity and reckless abandon. One transition (street to library) legible under continuous lens.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rain, book-damp scent, fogged windows form micro-pressure that alters tactics—wet pages demand careful flame, charging the lantern scene. Mica shard as portable setting constrains later choices. Sensory economy; every drizzle drop is felt, never scenic filler.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Primary stake—“how to confront uncertainty responsibly”—narrows steadily: graffiti, lantern, final vow. Price visible: she extinguishes flame, forfeits absolute control. Causal linkage holds; escalation is deepening, not added threats.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciling chance with responsibility grows organically through action, not speech. Final image (shard in pocket) resolves metaphorically without sermon. Contradictions remain unsolved but newly weighted.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dense, clover-melancholy diction remains internal to Elara’s perceptual signature. Syntax breathes with emotional tempo; humid compression followed by crisp final line. No drift into exposition loops.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Minimal scaffolding; every clause pushes goal or metaphor further. Mica glow and petrichor vivid yet controlled. One minor repetition of “lucid contradiction” nudge but never jars closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Probability professor + subway graffiti hunt is fresh angle without gimmick. Father’s relapse reframed through mica lantern avoids sentimental recovery. Risk pays without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
