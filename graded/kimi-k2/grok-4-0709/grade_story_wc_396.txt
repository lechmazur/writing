<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her calm intuition and shadow-laced nature manifest in concrete micro-choices (arranging mirrors, weaving visions). Motivation to “map empathy onto action” drives every beat, culminating in earned reconstitution. Minor slip: “courageous anomaly” is asserted more than dramatized, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the re-forged orb crystallizes actionable empathy, foreclosing passive waiting. Causal chain—fragment → mirrors → orb → descent—holds without gaps. Cost is felt in the orchard’s “nascent melt” and the stilling floes. One micro-turn suffices; lens is Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and constraining: frozen apples, groaning floes, attic mirrors etched with lost harvests. Environment guides choice—ice limits routes, mirrors enable reconstitution. Final image of glistening apples reweights the orchard as thawing hope. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unity before Council verdict—tightens as each mirror glimpse converts sorrow into actionable pact. Escalation is causal: each vision mends the orb and narrows Elara’s options toward decisive descent. Cost is implicit in the “weighted breath” and orchard’s sigh.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-as-action emerges organically from the reconstitution ritual; no explicit moralizing. Final image of thawing apples offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in shadows’ whispers and mirror visions deepens complexity without drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm and shadow-soaked diction. POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Compression (“weighted breath,” “shadow-ink”) serves pressure. Minor echo of “calmly intuitive” twice, not enough to cap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sensory specificity (“apples frozen mid-bloom,” “jagged edges reflecting distorted glimpses”) advances stakes. One mixed metaphor—“shadows whispered intuitions”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fusion of lighthouse orchard, shadow-borne peacekeeper, and empathy-forged crystal feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image. Premise avoids stock templates; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
