<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—detached performer vs. emerging vulnerability—is embodied in the moment the mask cracks when he hears the chimes’ harmonic chord. Mara’s micro-choice to don the cloak and unhook the logbook crystallizes her shift from certainty to doubt with visible cost. The only drag is a touch of diagnostic label-speak (“protected vulnerability”) that blunts immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance flips from seller to seeker of conscience, cost registered in the shard’s hollow echo and the quieting chimes. Causal chain holds—campfire threshold → climb → chime oracle → unhooking—without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse gallery, wind chimes, and dawn light are not backdrop but instruments: chimes dictate tactics, breeze enforces urgency, mirror shard catches first sun to amplify sound. Micro-setting (cloak, shard, logbook) constrains choices and charges the final image. One minor drift: “breezy lighthouse” repeats without fresh sensory angle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s decision to reveal or conceal—tightens once via the chimes’ oracle; unhooking the logbook forecloses denial with felt familial cost. Elias’s parallel crisis adds secondary pressure without diluting focus. Escalation is coherent under situational lens: external wind and internal doubt converge to force stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing doubt emerges through concrete objects (cloak, shard, chimes) and actions (unhooking), never stated. Final image—lighthouse as “beacon not of unwavering light, but of nuanced glow”—reweights premise without moralizing. One soft echo of “cloak of doubt” as label near end trims the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; perceptual signature shows in Elias’s synesthetic decoding of chimes and tactile handling of shard. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” vibe) nudges register drift under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive, and image-dense; sentences advance multiple jobs. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“cloak of doubt” worn yet also “shroud that invites questioning”—muddies physical logic for a beat, but clarity recovers before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise of “conscience for hire” is familiar, yet transformed through wind-chime oracle and hollow shard as diagnostic tools. Risk-taking in merging external oracle with internal crisis pays off; specificity of sail-cloth cloak and logbook unhooking anchors universals. No close echoes.</comment>
