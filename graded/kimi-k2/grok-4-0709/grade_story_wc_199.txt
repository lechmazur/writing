<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s orderly seed-sorter persona, initial quiet precision, and decisive pivot toward leaf-reading form a believable arc with embodied internal conflict. The moment she “pokes” the moonstone dust into the monument crystallizes her values and re-defines her agency, foreclosing her purely methodical path with a playful, felt cost. Quiet but earned Earned Renunciation/Resonation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: seed-sort → monument because folklore → moonstone prod → leaf divination → guardian emergence → renewed world-vow. Closure unit (charge leaf dance + felt cost of abandoning safe routine) lands on the page with visible transformation under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Zero contradictions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ashen-skyborne arbor is rendered with selective, live detail (whirled leaves, moss light, scent of forgot rain) that constrains choices and supplies a lifting, ethereal resource at climax. Specificity backs consequence: the sky is tangible yet transformable, embodying stakes world and self.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode falling leaves to save the gray world—escalates through monument-building and guardian summoning, each step narrowing possibilities and raising visible cost. No off-page luck; every beat intensifies under protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: renewal through remembering the forgotten. The silent leaf dance delivers a resonant, non-literal answer reweighting the arbor’s future without tidy moralizing. Consequence is felt in environmental color shift.</comment>

<comment>Lyrical, moss-drenched interiority is steady, specific, and unreliable only as warranted by wonder. No head-hopping; every line propels character and cadence at once. Rhythm tightens under emotional peaks (leaf blizzard).</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Compressed, sensory-dense prose with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is spare and purposeful; every sentence advances scene or spiritual climate without overwriting. Moonstone glint → leaf-veined gold → vine-flower spirit image chain is precise.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—orderly sorter vs. chaos of memory and prophecy—is a fresh angle, not a trope checklist. Synthesis occurs in the final tree-bloom image that recharges every earlier seed-sort and forgotten-snippet beat. Feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
