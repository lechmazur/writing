<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elias’s gloomy cheerfulness is textural and embodied in humming beats, but interior monologue wobbles into thematic echo near the end; the change he presses on himself arrives too late to earn full causality leverage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulatively-Lyric; the pattern is taught and closure lands as Charged Poise, yet the composite chronology (star charts, the logbook, cello) feels somewhat forced into the accordion triple→single beat squeeze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Half-finished cello and seashell function as micro-setting anchors; their physical constraints (hollow body, tactile vibration) make one pivotal retelling beat unplayable otherwise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is the fleeting-direction epiphany; pressure rises through hummed resonances but the coil never snaps—cost stays intellectual rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme asserts—life’s riddle is to cherish transience—via image rather than declaration; the final lament leaves enigmatic warmth without moral tagline.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Voice merges myth-buster jaunt and melancholy lyricism cleanly; however the celestial diary entries are filtered through neutral omniscience, briefly eroding perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and avatar-propulsive, with only mild figurative clump around “compass drawn in sand.” No loops, but one register spike into philosophical plural compasses jars.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar constellation-ruin trope is re-transliterated via earthy cello seashell, but not yet revelatory; the risk stays modest, reframing myth rather than smash-cutting it.</comment>
