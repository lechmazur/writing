<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—save her family’s orchard—drives every beat; her embodied fear and wonder under inversion are vivid. Interiority stays concrete, but the final leap into the glider feels slightly under-costed; we don’t feel the physical risk of gravity normalizing. Still, her contradictory awe and desperation ring true, and the choice to seize the arrow tip is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Lira secures the arrow tip and races home, a decisive change with implied cost—her grove’s fate now hinges on one relic. Causal chain holds: inversion → water path → grotto → relic. One transition (glider launch to grotto) is seamless. The lens is causal; each beat narrows options until the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and inverted rivers are not backdrop; they actively steer Lira’s flight path and force tactical dives. Sensory detail is selective—liquid-silver cascades, crimson fruit bubbles—filtered through pilot priorities. The grotto’s upside-down soil and silent echo-swirls charge the final discovery. Setting constrains choice throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled early and tightened by the ticking inversion hour. Mid-story, the water-flow reversal forces a micro-choice: dive against the upward current or abort. Cost is visible: time dwindles, arches begin to collapse. No external antagonist needed; environment and clock supply coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience emerges through the arrow relic and echo-guardians, never sermonized. The broken tip reframes prior whispers into tangible hope, reweighting the planet’s mythos. Final image—Lira soaring with the fragment—offers a charged poise: salvation possible yet unguaranteed. Subtext stays implicit, avoiding moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, mirroring a pilot’s alert sensorium: “whispering canopies,” “liquid silver.” Syntax modulates with gravity shifts—short clauses under inversion, longer sweeps during glide. No dialogue, so internal coherence is key; perceptual signature remains consistent. Compression (“whirling silence”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers action, atmosphere, and stakes. Metaphors are fresh and apt—“crimson bubbles” of fruit—without clutter. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates under pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“convergence that held the planet’s secrets”) fits the mythic register and never stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Gravity inversion as navigational puzzle, orchard planet as living archive, and silent echo-guardians synthesize into a singular vision. Familiar tropes—quest relic, dying grove—are transformed by the inversion mechanic and water-path navigation. The final image feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky world-building choices pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
