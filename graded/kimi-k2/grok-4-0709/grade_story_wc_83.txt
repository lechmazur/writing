<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amir’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in trembling fingers and whispered equations; the contradictory pull between vengeance and renewal is dramatized in the final reach toward the homeland pool. Interiority is specific, but the epiphany “to draw from it not vengeance, but renewal” arrives as a tidy label rather than earned contradiction, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Amir’s vow to “awaken what the world had buried” crystallizes a new stance with felt cost. Causal linkage holds—each perturbation tightens toward the homeland pool—yet the lens tilts slightly lyrical, not purely causal, which is acceptable under Hybrid. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory’s glass-and-steel fragility constrains every move; the geode’s quartz lattice literally bridges sensor and memory, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—humming capacitors, storm clouds below—filtered through Amir’s physicist eye. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate and perhaps redeem the lost potential—is signaled early and tightens with each perturbation. The final narrowing to the “vast reservoir over his homeland” forces a trade-off: touch the pool or let it drift. Cost is visible in the shuddering observatory and the trembling reach; escalation is coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of buried potential emerges from Amir’s hunt and the geode’s refraction of memory; no explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: potential is not abstract energy but the unlived lives of the dead, now a resource for renewal. Resonance is earned through concrete particulars, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is physicist-poet: precise diction (“perturbation theory,” “quantum foam”) braided with lyric cadence (“bleeding among the ruins,” “intangibly tangible”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Amir notices atmospheric anomalies before emotional ones. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated phrasing (“exhilaration laced in sorrow”) risks register drift but stays within Amir’s heightened state. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent. Final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses drone-strike trauma with quantum scavenging in a floating observatory—fresh synthesis. The geode-as-amplifier and homeland pool are specific inventions, not tropes. Risk-taking (lyric physics grief) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
