<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile reading of wood grain and the pilot logbook feels character-specific—but the “featherly determined” trait is asserted rather than embodied in a costly choice. The final renunciation (accepting loss as necessary distance) is earned by the preceding pattern work, yet the emotional cost is more stated than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias reweights his childhood loss from random tragedy to sacred necessity, visible in the final looped grain line. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each juxtaposition of wood grain and weather code thickens the pattern until the threshold insight crystallizes. Cost is legible in the phrase “ready to bridge those necessary distances with newfound reverence,” which concedes ongoing burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The drifting prism terrace is more than backdrop; its fractured light and faint chimes mirror Elias’s splintered memory and supply the hush that makes the final insight audible. The salvaged logbook and weathered table function as micro-settings that constrain his method and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—tightens through each cross-referencing beat until the final reconfiguration forecloses simpler grief. Pressure grows via pattern density rather than external opposition; the cost is the acceptance that his vanishing was not accidental but essential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The theme emerges organically from Elias’s ritual: sacredness arises from the hush before crossing, the necessary distance that amplifies small causes into destiny. No moralizing; the final image of the looping grain line offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that modulates from meditative slowness to the quiet snap of the closing insight. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices through texture, light, and pattern, never slipping into generic abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned early (fractured hush, featherly drift) and paid off at closure. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances pattern or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“ether,” “prismatic edges”) is justified by the elevated setting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of corn-maze memory, pilot logbook weather codes, and wood-grain divination feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression is sustained without loss of clarity; the butterfly-effect frame is transformed into intimate metaphysics rather than clichéd chaos theory.</comment>
