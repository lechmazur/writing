<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is embodied in the locket and stencil, but his interiority drifts into summary (“subdued ardor,” “quiet mission”) rather than contradictory impulse. Lira’s arrival supplies pressure, yet her choice to accept the tattoo feels externally prompted, not wrestled from her own fracture. The final cost—Elias’s continued solitude—is visible but not dramatized as a fresh wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s tattooed skin and departing origami crystallize the observatory’s ethic of renewal, with Elias’s solitude as felt cost. Causal chain holds—origami leads Lira, stencil enables passage—but the curtains’ rule-set is asserted more than tested. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of blooming artifacts reweights the stake without a single decisive turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s starlit hush and folding curtains are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elias’s creased vellum. Environment constrains choice: only the stencil’s glow parts the veils. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift into catalog. Final image of embedded vellum fragment charges the setting with lingering cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach withering to bloom—tightens when Lira hesitates before the curtains; stencil + tattoo force the trade-off. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each origami, each bloom pattern, layers density until the path opens. Cost is visible in Elias’s renewed solitude, though Lira’s agency feels slightly smoothed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through artifice emerges from the stencil’s living ink and Elias’s mourning jewelry, never sermonized. Subtext pulses in the “genuinely artificial” paradox and the final embedded fragment. Final image reweights the premise: artificial vines can still root in grief. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in Elias’s quiet fire.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with controlled compression (“time folded like parchment”). Perceptual signature centers on tactile grief—locket weight, vellum warmth—without head-hop. Dialogue is spare and subtextual; Elias’s whisper carries restrained passion. Rhythm modulates with pressure, no syntactic monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence layering image or motion. Occasional elevated phrasing (“domed heart veiled by curtains of intention”) flirts with purple but stays tethered to POV. No loops or scaffold; minor filter-verb clusters (“he watched,” “he explained”) do not stall momentum. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mourning jewelry, living tattoo ink, and dream-woven curtains feels fresh and inevitable. Premise transforms grief-artifact trope into regenerative ritual. Specificity of synthetic vellum and starlit origami anchors the fantastical. Risk in quiet, accumulative structure pays off in final reconfiguration.</comment>
