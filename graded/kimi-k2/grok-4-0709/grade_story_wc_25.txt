<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s gait-reading gift and whisper-philosophy are concrete and embodied; the coin-flip micro-choices show interior hierarchy under pressure. Marcus’s heavy tread and exhausted trudge crystallize status collapse. The final “subtlety endures” lands as earned renunciation with visible social cost. Minor: Marcus’s interior remains generic, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: geomagnetic storm → scrambled compasses → Elias’s pre-planned whisper challenge → decisive arrival first. Closure beat “See? Subtlety endures” is on-page Decisive Change with Marcus’s defeated gait as felt cost. One tight escalation suffices. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Container labyrinth is tactile and shifting; storm-light flicker warps perception and guides the folded-map reveal. Brass key tracing patterns on metal turns the setting into active constraint. Final image of storm fading over re-shaped maze recharges earlier sensory cues. Micro-setting (key, coin) also constrains choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“whispers vs shouts”—is signaled early and tested in the race. One meaningful tightening: Marcus’s shouts amplify panic while Elias’s whispers narrow options toward victory. Cost legible in Marcus’s exhausted trudge. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (storm) complicates, does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of subtle guidance emerges from concrete race mechanics, not assertion. Final whispered triumph reweights prior shouts into hollow noise. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether Marcus learns. Motif recurrence (coin, maps) constrains tactics rather than decorating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—footfalls as identity, brass key as stylus. Syntax modulates with pressure: clipped whispers vs Marcus’s bluster. No head-hop; interiority remains character-bound. Dialogue sparse but subtextual; voices distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. “Fold left at the Virgo stack” marries instruction to zodiac cue without clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“auroral light”) fits elevated storm mood. One mixed metaphor—“threads in a tapestry”—minor, does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: geomagnetic storm + gait-recognition + origami maps + key-without-lock as navigation tool. Tropes (mentor duel, storm chaos) are grounded in port logistics and sensory specificity. Risky structural bet—single escalating race—pays off with earned stasis. No derivative echoes.</comment>
