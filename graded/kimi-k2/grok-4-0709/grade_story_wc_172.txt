<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—greed vs. reverence—are embodied in the micro-choice to turn the valve; the cost (empire collapse, exposure) is felt on the page. Sentiment is dramatized through tactile handling of the egg and whispered promise, not label. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific. Flaws complicate the final act; the renunciation is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: water released, drought ended, empire ruined. Causal chain—crack-map → valve → flood—holds under Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is explicit: “this release would ruin his profits, expose his schemes.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Salt flat, egg, and valve form a micro-setting that constrains every move; the cracked riverbed literally guides Elias’s hand. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV urgency. Environment evolves with the flood, charging the final image. Weather shift is causal, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the bird’s echo vs. preserve empire—tightens once when Elias chooses release. Escalation is a single, meaningful turn under Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is visible and irreversible. Coincidence (storm) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: redemption through self-ruin. Subtext resides in the egg’s shimmer and the salt dissolving like “tears on a broken mirror.” Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—absolution or mere spectacle—yet feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; syntax mirrors Elias’s fractured grandeur. Perceptual signature is consistent—he sees flight patterns in cracks, hears songs in vapor. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Figurative language is purposeful and patterned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm modulates with action—short bursts under pressure, longer coils in reflection. No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction fits Elias’s self-mythologizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—philanthropist-engineered drought redeemed by extinct-bird egg—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (redemption arc, magical egg) are transformed through concrete world-logic and moral cost. Specificity of salt-flat mechanics and corporate sleight-of-hand grounds the concept.</comment>
