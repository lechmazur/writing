<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her disenchantment embodied in the heat of the ember grotto and the slip of Lir’s hand—but the final choice to dip her fingers feels slightly under-motivated; the “softly commanding” trait is asserted more than dramatized in that beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the bleeding starlight reveals the council’s lie, reweighting Elara’s quest from escape to reclamation. The causal chain holds—dreams → climb → ritual → revelation—though the shared exhale/fireflies beat could be foreshadowed earlier to tighten linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto’s star-veined ceiling and slicing ice crystals are tactile and constraining; the ember grotto’s heat literally steers their pause. Setting repeatedly guides choice, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet a few phrases (“lacy menace”) flirt with overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus safety—escalates via thinning air, poisonous vines, and the whispered temptations of starlight. One clear tightening: Lir’s slip forces Elara to reaffirm the bond, foreshadowing the later betrayal reveal. Cost is felt but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s price emerges through concrete images—bleeding stars, council deceit—without sermonizing. The final image of descent with “lace-woven stars” reconfigures the dream motif into resolve, though the temptation whisper edges toward overt allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with rhythmic compression under stress (“measured gasps… defiance”). Distinct perceptual signature—Elara’s synesthetic heat-kiss and star-hemorrhage—holds throughout; only minor register drift (“malevolent sprites”) nicks perfection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and sensorily dense, but occasional stacked metaphors (“liquid lace,” “lacy menace”) create slight clutter. No loops or scaffold; strong verbs anchor action. One mixed metaphor—“stars weeping bleeding starlight”—momentarily muddles physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest arc is refreshed by the inversion that the dreams were bait laid by her own council; bleeding starlight as both oracle and trap feels specific to this world. Risky lyricism mostly pays off, though “lacy menace” verges on gimmick.</comment>
