<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena’s interior motive—“to prove that listening heals”—is stated early and reiterated, but her contradictory impulses are not dramatized in scene; she moves from witness to facilitator without visible internal cost or micro-choice under pressure. The final embrace is affective, yet the change in her own grief is asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mailbox opens, letters are read, communal catharsis occurs—an Earned Stasis that forecloses the mystery. Causality is mosaic-storytelling-driven; each elder’s tale supplies a piece, but the final beat is more accumulative reveal than decisive Elena act with personal cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The courtyard at dawn is sketched with selective sensory strokes—amber light, bubbling fountain, olive tree hollow—that orient and mirror the calm-after-storm mood. Yet the environment never materially constrains choices; the key is found, not forced by setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“unlock the mailbox to heal the neighborhood”—is clear. Pressure tightens only narratively: each story adds urgency, but no on-page obstacle or trade-off threatens failure; the key discovery is frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening-as-healing emerges organically through communal storytelling rather than sermonizing. The final image of shared embraces reweights earlier isolation without moralizing, though the complexity of “healing” is smoothed into consensus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Third-limited narration stays anchored to Elena’s perceptions; descriptions carry her curator’s eye for detail. Dialogue is minimal but natural; elders’ voices are differentiated by content rather than idiom, acceptable for brief cameos.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and concise; occasional soft fillers (“quietly,” “softly”) could be trimmed. No loops or mixed metaphors, but also no standout compression or sonic patterning that elevates cadence under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The locked-mailbox trope is refreshed by collective oral history rather than a single genealogical twist, yet the overall arc remains familiar. Specific desert-town textures and multicultural neighbors add freshness, but the synthesis feels safe rather than daring.</comment>
