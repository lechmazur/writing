<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Elias’s sensory-memory vocation and grief-driven motivation are palpable, but interiority flirts with abstract wisdom-speak ("flavors of their last meal now blooming") more than felt paradox. Micro-choice to bite the fruit lands with cost, though earlier resolve is slightly over-told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lens locks to Accumulative/Textural under Hybrid mode: celestial alignment’s glow intensifies pattern until the pruning synaptic act reweights memory with earned resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the shared sanctuary is born, the regime’s erasure challenged—with the tangible cost of Elias’s own pain relived and repurposed.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The rusted greenhouse is rendered with textured specificity ("iron skeletons loomed," "juices of forgotten harvests") and becomes an evolving instrument: first decay, then revitalized frames, finally charged sanctuary. Every detail earns plot use—glass glinting under tri-moonlight cues the pruning hour.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—memory reclamation versus enforced amnesia—tightens once, crystallized when Elias chooses to prune himself first. The celestial alignment intensifies pressure; cost is felt both physically (re-experiencing loss) and socially (sanctuary now vulnerable). Agency is clear, luck only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme of subversive re-enchantment emerges through concrete cultivation and taste; memory as sustenance vs mandated erasure resonates without sermon. Final image of whispered sanctuary quietly defies regime erasure, inviting ambiguous reader reckoning.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Consistent lyric-poetic texture blends culinary and botanical registers; occasional elevation ("synesthetic shimmer of tri-moonlight") still fits Elias’s synesthetic voice. Compression and synaesthetic metaphor align with focalizer perception and remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences do varied work ("shuffled through the overgrown vines, his apron stained"), rhythms accelerate with pruning action. No loops, mixed metaphors, or overwriting in climactic bites. Minor density in description of seed lineage could tighten one clause.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Synesthetic-chef meets dystopian botany is fresh synthesis; alignment-pruning as synaptic gardening holds surprise without gimmick. Risk lies in synesthesia clichés, but specifics (tasting vanilla-scented childhoods) keep it particular.</comment>
