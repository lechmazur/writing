<comment>Elias’s compulsive mapping and inherited avoidance read clearly on the page; each tremor of certainty manifests in embodied micro-choices (tracing cracks with mapping habit, confessing before the punch). Yet interior contradictions resolve into acceptance so swiftly that the final stride into the fortress feels narrated rather than dramatized, nudging the score from excellence.</comment>

<comment>Closure is earned: the confession-punch physically summons the phantom train, after which the family-curse reversal crystallized as ‘truths fortified against denial’. Cost manifests in the irrevocable boarding and the shattering of lifelong habit. Causal links from cracked arrows → map → ticket → train remain clean, but the transition between the ticket punch and the fortress itself relies on spectral shorthand rather than grounded consequence, curbing the top band.</comment>

<comment>Derelict platform, mist, and the crystal-shadow fortress all accrue specificity; orientation is settled early by the fissured pavement. The phantom rails shimmer but don’t ultimately constrain the final choice, so the environment stops short of the gate-shaping criterion.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—face the truth of his parents’ disappearance—intensifies as each fissure-arrow narrows escape routes, culminating in the punched confession. The cost is the lifelong mapping reflex itself; he pays it once the train seals. Stakes never drift or inflate; causality remains tight.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Truth as the price of avoidance emerges organically via inheritance, cursed silence, and the crystalline fortress. The theme avoids didacticism but flirts with neat allegorical payoff; resonance gains force because Elias himself writes the price on the ticket.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The free-indirect voice is both analytic and tactile—‘mapping routes in his sleep’, ‘a sound like distant thunder’. Stylistic control holds throughout, with rhythmic compression under stress. Slight drift toward overt lyricism in the closing image reins the top mark.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and atmospheric, free of scaffolding or cliché. Occasional ornamental clusters (“starlit vault pulsing”) briefly dampen immediacy, but core beats remain clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The mythic train-yard conceit inherits from urban fantasy and trauma fable, yet Elias’s mapping psyche, confession-as-fare, and crack-guided rails grant freshness. The synthesis avoids tropish repetition while risking familiar spectral-train iconography.</comment>
