<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifism is embodied in her refusal to strike and her choice to stitch, but the interior contradiction between pacifism and suppressed rage is told more than dramatized; the final weightless joy feels earned yet slightly abstract because the rage never visibly threatens her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portal opens and Lira floats through, leaving the ship behind—cost is the abandonment of the recycled husk. Causal chain holds: each stitched photograph tightens the path to the final beat under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The recycled ship is sketched with tactile relics—magnetic frames, stasis vault, zero-g decks—that constrain movement and mood; the archive room’s photographs function as micro-setting objects that directly enable the stitching action, charging the final map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—open the locked dimension—escalates via each photograph’s shimmer; each stitch forecloses the option of violence and deepens the cost of pacifist commitment. One clear tightening beat per photograph suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of compassionate integration emerges organically from the stitching action; the final image of ghostly rebirth reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the shimmer of tears rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and filtered through Lira’s pacifist perception; patterned elision (“ghostly resolve,” “faded dreams”) is taught early and paid off in the final buoyant drift. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with rhythmic variation and purposeful compression; occasional stacked modifiers (“crystalline traces that caught the dim light”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of post-human pacifist ghost conducting Buddhist-inflected shadow work via photograph-tears; the gravitational-joy trait and stitched empathy feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky.</comment>
