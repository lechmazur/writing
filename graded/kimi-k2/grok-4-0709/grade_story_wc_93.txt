<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority pulses vividly—"precognitively cursed...visions of betrayal or loss" vs "quiet promise to her vanished mother"—and the final renunciation ("she stood still") costs her prized elusiveness. Traits shape tangible choices: avoiding places, resisting star-dust temptation, then accepting rootedness. Only minor distance: the eel-herding skill is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and sustained; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“the universe’s friction had been an illusion, temporary grip eternally borrowed.” Cost is visible: Elara sacrifices continuous flight for understanding. Beat-to-beat linkage is pattern-based rather than causal, handled expertly within the chosen design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Aurora-tidal bluff functions as micro-setting that anchors and constrains every movement: "frictionless tides" and "cursed bluff’s edge" determine how rocks slide, eels glide, and star dust adheres. Environmental detail is selective, sensory, and repeatedly leveraged in the ritual mechanics. Meets the 9+ test: the bluff’s lack of friction directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understand vs flee—is signaled early and tightens when precog vision presents “cost of elusiveness.” One meaningful intensification: placing the eighth Fibonacci rock ignites star dust, forcing the irreversible trade-off. No extraneous reversals; coincidence appears only as complicating wash-up, never as resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Emergent theme—illusion of permanence vs harmony in endless movement—grows from concrete image sequences rather than commentary. No explicit moral; the final reweighting reframes "mend what friction stole" as acceptance of slide. Subtext in eels’ circling approval and her sudden stillness lands cleanly without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric-tight yet legible: "ghosts chasing forgotten dreams" teaches compressed mode early, paid off at closure. POV modulation under stress matches Elara’s selective noticing—aurora hues, rock symbols—without drifting. Sentence rhythm shifts echo breathlessness of the final moment of anchoring. No dialogue required; internal diction stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and nearly free of scaffold. Images do double work: "gravitational whisper" compresses force and sound. Only one minor loop—“slippery paths” echoed 60 words later—but it sharpens rather than dulls. High precision throughout; closure beat is clean and felt.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-friction world, eel herding as occupation, mathematical ritual for cosmic mapping. Premise obeys its own physical drift and delivers a non-obvious but inevitable revelation. Specificity ("collapsed star dust") and original ritual keep it far from generic. Transformation survives proximity check; no close echoes of prior text.</comment>
