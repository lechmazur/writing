<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s fierce tenderness and cryptic medium identity are embodied through her micro-choices—tracing condensation, pressing the shard, whispering to spirits. The interior contradiction (seeking apology yet fearing vulnerability) is present but summarized more than dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of cryptic solitude is earned by the shard’s healing cost and the spirits’ choral pressure. Voice remains consistent, though “cryptic” is asserted rather than revealed through speech patterns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara steps out “ready to decide anew,” the cost being the reopened wound of regret now sealed by moonlight. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of unsent letters and spirit song intensifies until the final stance crystallizes. Orientation is clear by line 3; no drift. One transition (into boathouse) is clean. Causality holds: shard’s healing demands truth, which compels the evocation, which yields the apology moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s medium perception. The boathouse window becomes micro-setting where condensation, moonlight, and shard converge to constrain the evocation ritual. Spatial choreography is coherent; roots shift, spirits circle, moonlight angles change. Environment subtly mirrors internal state—brackish water, fogged glass, echoing songs—without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaim the suspended moment before the unsent apology hardens into permanent loss. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each traced message tightens the emotional vise until the final image of cascading script forces the stance shift. Cost is the reopened emotional wound and the irrevocable exposure of her cryptic facade. No external reversals; the tightening is internal and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of fierce tenderness as both wound and balm emerges from the shard’s dual action—cutting and healing—and the spirits’ lullaby-blade songs. Subtext operates in the condensation: words appear as if by another hand, revealing the lover’s parallel regret. Final image reframes the apology not as closure but as threshold. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “ready to decide anew.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent with a cryptic medium’s heightened perception. Syntax modulates with intensity: longer clauses for wonder, fragments under pressure. “Fierce tenderness” recurs as rhythmic anchor. No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Occasional elevated diction (“limbo before a choice hardened into fate”) fits the mystical register without drifting into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“roots arched like forgotten promises”). No loops or synonym churn. One mixed metaphor—“singing spirits hummed melodies of lost regrets”—is minor. Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Final paragraph achieves cadence shift that signals closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fusion of gothic shard, mangrove spirits, and unsent letters feels fresh; none are used generically. The shard’s cathedral origin recontextualized in tropical decay creates unexpected resonance. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot—but coherence holds. Avoids stock medium tropes by keeping the lover off-page, making the apology a liminal object rather than dialogue.</comment>
