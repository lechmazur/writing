<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath fogging the visor”), but the final choice—how she will “weave the truth carefully”—is stated rather than dramatized, muting the felt cost. The ghosts’ chorus supplies pressure, yet Elara’s contradictory impulses remain off-stage, so the renunciation reads as pre-decided.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shrine “seemed to sigh in relief” and the starlight brightens, signaling the salvaged soul. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dream-cameo adds density until the globe reframes them—but the cost to Elara herself is only implied, not visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The candle-lit ice shrine is tactile and constraining (“narrow tunnels,” “frozen driftwood pedestal”), and the melted globe’s warped glass literally refracts the borrowed starlight, charging the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent; cold and flicker guide every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging a pure fragment from betrayal—tightens when the ghosts reveal the framed cabin boy. Pressure escalates via the accumulating dream-cameos, but the decisive turn (Elara’s plan to use guided dreams) is announced rather than enacted, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: purity wrested from complicity, starlight loaned rather than owned. The final image of brighter starlight outside the shrine offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to spectral texture (“spectral voices that clung to them like frost”). Patterned elision—dream fragments, candle shadows—is taught early and paid off in the closing vision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold appears (“whispers,” “secrets” twice) but never in the closure beat. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the vision cascade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Arctic ghost lore, dream-cameo forensics, and salvaged purity feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring causality; the melted globe’s distortion as lens is a non-obvious but earned device.</comment>
