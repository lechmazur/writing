<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s ache for connection is embodied in the binary roses he etches; the contradiction between ghostly detachment and tactile creation is vivid. Lira’s arrival supplies immediate relational pressure that crystallizes Elowen’s choice, but her interiority is thin, muting the crucible effect. The final nod carries earned cost—his code unravels with audible loss—yet the prior beats lean on lyric summary rather than micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Elowen’s materialization and song mark a legible before/after under a Causal lens. The flower-press graffiti sequence tightens options beat-by-beat until Lira’s twist frees him; cost is felt in the thunder-shaken courtyard. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating courtyard’s marble veins and storm-charged air constrain every move; the flower press itself becomes micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory selection narrows to the metallic hum and ozone crackle under time pressure. Final image recharges the glowing graffiti as both map and scar.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom from code-loop—tightens once when the lightning-thunder clock forces the encode act. Agency is Elowen’s; coincidence (Lira’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is visible in the unraveling code and the thunder’s irreversible boom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of unheard voices seeking form emerges through the graffiti’s living binary petals; no explicit moralizing. The final promise of “stories yet to be sung” reweights the courtyard from prison to conduit without tidy resolution. Subtext hums in the flower press’s click and the storm’s withheld breath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is spectral yet tactile—“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong wonder”—with rhythmic compression that mirrors code loops. POV stays locked to Elowen until the brief, justified shift to Lira’s decoding fingers. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent with ghost-minstrel lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. Occasional stacked modifiers (“whimsy of street scrawls with the precision of algorithms”) flirt with overwriting but serve the hybrid aesthetic. No loops or scaffold in the final third; cadence accelerates with the storm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “ghost in code” premise fused with tinker-era flower press feels inevitable in hindsight; no close genre echoes. Risk lies in the lyric-digital graft, executed without gimmickry. Specificity of binary roses and humming bolts anchors universals of isolation and release.</comment>
