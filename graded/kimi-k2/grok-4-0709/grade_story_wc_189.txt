<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied; his contradictory impulses—quiet chronicler vs. active seer—surface in the cicada’s placement. Elara’s fear is shown through breath and finger-twist, not labels. The final hand-off of the cicada crystallizes a cost for both: Elara must leave, Kael must let her, and the moment is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pause thickens, the pool’s micro-drama reweights stakes, and the cicada’s return reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara holding the cicada under starlight—where the cost of departure is felt without exposition. No orientation drift; causality is oblique but coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, tidal pool, and jade cicada function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the pool’s retreat exposes the cicada, the grotto’s open ceiling admits starlight that Kael reads. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the final image of starlight on wet jade charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s departure—tightens through the lengthening pause and Kael’s indirect foresight. One meaningful deepening: the cicada’s shadow reveals Elara’s future, narrowing her options from “what if I can’t” to acceptance. Cost is legible in the cooled air and the relinquished relic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges from tide, cicada, and starlight without overt statement. Subtext lives in gesture: the cicada passed hand-to-hand becomes a non-literal answer to “what if I can’t let go.” Final image reweights prior motifs—rebirth, ebb, renewal—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Kael’s chronicler diction; perceptual signature is consistent—he sees time in grains and textures. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Rhythm modulates with the tide’s retreat, accelerating slightly at the hand-off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“frozen emerald waves,” “woven tapestry of time”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the surf’s hush, closing on a resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—oracle object, parting lovers—are transformed through tidal microcosm and indirect divination. The cicada’s rebirth lore is retooled as a lens, not a prophecy device. Specificity of chronicler vocation and grotto ecology makes the synthesis feel inevitable and fresh.</comment>
