<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s prism-minded trait is embodied in her split-second tactical refractions under pressure; the orb-grab moment crystallizes her obsession with a visible cost (nearly ensnared). Interiority stays concrete, but a few “latent blaze” abstractions edge toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from manuscript alignment through orb theft to gravity renormalization. Closure is a decisive change—she exits with the orb and altered knowledge—cost paid in near-capture and prior flight memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s inverted gravity and mist actively constrain every move; the luminous vines project a prismatic path that literally guides her feet. Setting is not backdrop but tactical terrain, charging the final scramble.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find forgotten combinations”—is tested twice: first retreat, then successful theft under ticking hourglass of inversion. Escalation tightens when the seed cracks and tendril snaps, forcing a trade-off of safety for knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge’s cost emerges through embodied ordeal; no moralizing, only the charged image of orb clutched against retreating mist. The prism motif refracts from metaphor to literal survival tool, reweighting obsession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is crystalline, syntactically varied, and POV-locked; “prism-minded” perception colors every sensory filter. No head-hop, no register drift; even the lyric density serves the focalizer’s fractured focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive, high-density, and read-aloud rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“latent blaze simmering beneath the calm”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. Zero loops or filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Inversion-gravity heist in a sentient grotto feels fresh; the doodle-map and seeds-of-vigilance are not mere props but causal agents. Specificity and risk-taking integrate without gimmickry.</comment>
