<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—compassion for the sapling and inherited guilt—are embodied in the grafting act; the coin/thread binding literalizes the cost of her father’s legacy. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she stands beside the singing tree, her own scars warmed, foreclosing vengeance. One slip: “gracefully alert” is repeated as label rather than enacted in every beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each return to the lagoon thickens pattern—black sand, kelp drift, migrating clouds—until the grafted sapling’s song reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the gathered nomads and Elara’s warmed scars make the cost undeniable. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One micro-turn: clouds part to reveal the obsidian depths, cueing the graft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, and kelp strands are filtered through Elara’s fire-trained senses; each detail constrains the grafting ritual. The black sand’s mineral promise and the lagoon’s brine are tactile resources, not backdrop. Final image: lagoon whispers approval, recharging the kelp-drift motif. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens when the grafted sapling vibrates with melody; the cost is Elara’s public exposure of her lineage to the nomads. Pressure grows accumulatively: each evening watering with brine deepens commitment. No external antagonist needed; internal stakes escalate through ritual repetition. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the graft itself: fire-scarred past made resonant through care. No moralizing; the singing tree is the non-literal answer. Subtext in the coin’s repurposing: luck turned scar. Final image reweights “scars can sing” without stating it. Complexity preserved: father’s legacy neither forgiven nor erased.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in firefighter precision: “kelp-drift peace,” “obsidian depths.” Syntax mirrors Elara’s alert stillness—long sentences for ritual, fragments for sensory spikes. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Patterned elision (time jumps between evenings) is taught early and paid off in accelerated growth.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and purpose. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent: “clouds clustered like a chorus” sustains the song motif. Minor overwriting in “gracefully alert” repetition, but it does not touch closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies; paragraph cuts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—arsonist’s daughter healing through fire-adjacent ritual—is fresh, not moralistic. Transformation test fails if names change: volcanic sand, drilled coin, and kelp song are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off: final song reconfigures stakes. No close echoes; voice is singular.</comment>
