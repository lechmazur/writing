<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shard’s pulse against her palm and the ozone-metallic scent anchor her sensory map-maker identity. Contradictory impulses—yearning for truth versus fear of its cost—surface in micro-choices like the fierce redirect that risks multiverse loss. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: she shoulders the silence no longer, earning a credible shift. Minor slip: “burden of silence that had warped her life” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara re-enters the abandoned bay resolved to speak the withheld truth, the green shard now cooled—visible cost of knowledge gained. Causal chain holds: shard attunes → redirect → confrontation → merge insights → new resolve. Orientation is taught early via sensory anchors; deliberate disorientation later serves the dream logic. One micro-turn suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The repair bay’s rusted tools and nightflower scent are filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities, constraining her mapping choices. Spatial choreography is clean; the mirrored bay in the parallel thread re-uses the same objects with altered meaning. Environment charges the final image: the once-abandoned bay now feels like a threshold rather than a tomb. Slight over-reliance on visual could have admitted more tactile detail under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—tightens when the defector revelation forecloses the “missing brother” fantasy. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: each redirect narrows options and raises the cost of further jumps. The final cost is legible: she must now bear public shame to lift private silence. No extraneous reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: sensory mapping as both gift and burden, truth as weight that deforms reality. Subtext operates in the shard’s heartbeat and the brother’s scarred silence. Final image reweights the premise—truth is no longer elusive but chosen—without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in the empire’s looming wrath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise: “rust whispered echoes,” “loom operated by will alone.” Perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure; compression in peak beats (“redirect fiercely”) mirrors urgency. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elara’s sensory lens. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when the brother murmurs her name.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. Rhythm modulates naturally, accelerating during redirects, breathing in reflective beats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. Minor mixed metaphor—“tapestry of smells… like a loom”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses sensory cartography with multiverse travel in a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes (lost sibling, war defector) are transformed through Elara’s unique craft and the shard’s heartbeat. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: the abandoned bay becomes a crossroads rather than a ruin. Specificity grounds the speculative frame in lived detail.</comment>
