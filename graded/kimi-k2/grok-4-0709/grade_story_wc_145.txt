<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s childhood map obsession is sketched but never tested; the “subtly confident” mask is stated more than embodied. Interiority is vivid (“worrying tranquility”) yet lacks contradictory impulse under pressure. The final step onto the ice is a credible renunciation with cost—he may freeze—but the choice feels inevitable rather than wrestled. Overall, a strong but not fully fleshed psyche.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elias steps onto the lake, options narrowed, cost legible (“If I freeze…”). Causal chain—falcon → coordinates → condensation oracle → departure—holds. Orientation is clear by line 6; no lens ambiguity. Minor slack: the condensation oracle’s rules are asserted rather than dramatized, blurring causality one notch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation on glass are rendered with tactile economy. The glass rivulets double as map and oracle, constraining the final choice. Weather and isolation press on every beat. One more sensory risk (sound of ice cracking underfoot) would have capped the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the rivers’ birth—signaled early and tightened once: the condensation pattern confirms the path, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the physical peril of the trek, felt but not yet paid. Agency is present; coincidence (condensation pattern matching coordinates) complicates rather than resolves. A sharper, on-page forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of origin vs. oblivion emerges through the convergence image and the risk of freezing. Subtext whispers in the falcon’s silence and the “universe’s etch-a-sketch.” No moralizing; the final quip keeps it wry. The reweighting is present but muted—could resonate one degree deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is dry, precise, lightly sardonic—“feathered messenger,” “pub instead of the source.” Syntax stays controlled; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“heralding his own quiet revolution”) edges toward grandeur but remains within Elias’s atlas-editor register. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“shroud of tranquility”—is minor. Clean mechanics, strong paragraph cuts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Convergence of cartography, falconry, and condensation oracle feels fresh yet inevitable. Transforms the trope of “quest for source” into a quiet, near-mystical science. Risk is understated; a bolder structural gamble could have lifted it to 8.5+.</comment>
