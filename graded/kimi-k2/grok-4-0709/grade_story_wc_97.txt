<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s longing is embodied in tactile piano play and the pocketed clock; his strategic creativity shows in decoding compasses and timing the splice. Yet the interior contradiction—yearning vs. acceptance—never sharpens under pressure; the filmic reunion feels gifted rather than wrested. Lila’s flickering presence is more apparition than crucible, so the relational change is asserted, not dramatized. The final smile registers triumph but the cost to Elias remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored clock and steady compasses mark a before/after shift with felt cost—Elias must leave the filmic refuge and resume solitary vigil. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each compass flicker, splice timing, and piano bleed layers density until the monochrome rupture reweights fate. One minor drift: the splice mechanics are revealed late, so the orientation debt nudges the score down.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vivid—vine platforms, salt-kissed leaves, ether tides—yet its floating geography is sketched more than spatially tracked. Micro-setting triumphs: the broken clock as pocket-weight and the projector’s beam as portal constrain Elias’s choices. The monochrome film-world supplies a tactile counter-realm that charges the final image. Still, a clearer anchor of vertical scale would sharpen stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewrite fate’s ending—signals early and tightens once: the compasses stabilize only after Elias risks irreversible exile from the filmic Lila. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The felt cost (leaving Lila again) is legible yet briefly stated, capping the score just below the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of defying scripted destiny emerges through action: piano notes bleeding color into monochrome, clock hands re-aligning. Subtext whispers in the splice itself—art editing life. The final image of Elias smiling under star-pierced clouds offers a non-literal answer: some encores rewrite the stars, but the cost is solitude. No moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“salt-kissed leaves,” “tides of ether”—with rhythmic control that swells like the arbor itself. POV stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature filters every detail through his musical ear. Compression and patterned elision (“eternities,” “steel-soft ache”) are taught early and paid off in the monochrome bleed. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and almost loop-free; only a faint echo—“tidal arbor swayed gently, a refuge secured”—leans close to redundancy. Metaphors are coherent, never contradictory. Sentence rhythm modulates with urgency; no filter-verb clusters or scaffold. Minor tightening could excise two near-repetitions of “refuge.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cloud-top station, film-reel portal, and fate-as-editor conceit synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Tropes of lost love and time loops are transformed through musical coloration and splice mechanics. The risk of meta-cinematic escape pays off without gimmickry. Only the flicker of Lila’s generic silhouette keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>
