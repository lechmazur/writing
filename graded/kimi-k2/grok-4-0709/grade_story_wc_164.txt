<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—wonder vs. sorrow—stays embodied in the glass and seeds, but the “cheerful gloom” label is repeated instead of freshly enacted; no micro-choice after the first seed reading means the final insight feels inherited rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each seed/glass pairing thickens the pattern until the final map reweights “missing pieces” with conceptual cost; orientation is swift, the single deepening is legible, and the closure image (“luminous stories on the cave walls”) pays off the setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Geode light and crater glass act as micro-setting that literally refracts choice; selective sensory detail (cool glass, damp soil) is filtered through Elara’s recollectionist bias, though “iridescent” risks over-repeat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens as each seed forecloses one hypothetical trail; the glass’s transliteration supplies visible cost, but escalation is more accretive than decisive, keeping pressure steady rather than spiking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the iterative seed readings: disappearance is not malice but natural drift; the final image of stories dancing on walls offers a non-literal, charged answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“sea-foam recollectionist,” “crater glass”) is consistent, rhythm breathes with the cave’s drip, no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density—most sentences do two jobs; occasional modifier stacks (“obsidian-like shard…starry veins”) flirt with purple but never stall the beat; no loops or scaffold in closing third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sea-foam memory harvesting via meteor glass and storm-flung seeds is a fresh synthesis; the migratory-bird-as-chance mechanism feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar “lost paths” trope into luminous specificity.</comment>
