<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“acoustically perceptive,” “hummed faintly in his hands”), but the final vow feels slightly pre-articulated rather than wrested from contradiction; no opposing impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the cost reads as chosen rather than compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the unbinding releases the accumulated resonance. Closure is a Charged Poise—the freed echo lingers, reconfiguring the chronic hush with audible cost. Orientation is swift; driftwood-to-flint transition is the single allowed micro-turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass “half-submerged like a forgotten bubble” and “brackish water” on apple branches are selective, pressure-driven details that constrain movement and charge the final image; the bowl’s vibration against submerged acoustics makes the micro-setting itself a resonant instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty in incompletion—tightens when the bowl’s captive song demands release; the vow to “revel in its eternal becoming” forecloses any urge to finish the melody, paying the cost of perpetual incompleteness. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between completion and echo; the final image of “notes fading into the night like embers” offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo in dialogue; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“drip of water and the creak of shipwrecks”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature—sound-first noticing—remains consistent; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned early (“glass dome half-submerged like a forgotten bubble”) and paid off. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“magnificent simplicity”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-burn drowned coast, echo-harbor violinist, and unbinding a clay bowl’s trapped song synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. The risk of lyric accumulation pays off in the final acoustic image; no derivative templates detected.</comment>
