<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-soaked vigil is viscerally embodied in the tapping habit and the frayed atlas page; the interior contradiction between scientific duty and filial betrayal is alive in every drum of her fingers. The moment she recognizes her father’s Morse-coded confession, her prior stoicism cracks with credible cost—tears mix with humid salt air, proving endurance has limits. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps the relational crucible from full ignition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative pattern (tapping → atlas → Morse) tightens like a tide cycle, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “disappearing” paths are re-mapped as submerged, and her father’s guilt is repriced inside the same image. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each new layer of data is physically handled, delaying revelation until the rhythm itself becomes the key. Cost is legible in the final line—her affirmation tap carries the weight of inherited complicity she now must broadcast.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The solar-pod station is sketched with sensory economy—bioluminescent panels, creaking moorings, storm-lashed dome—each detail filtering through Elara’s marine-biologist gaze. The atlas page functions as micro-setting: its frayed edge and indented Morse physically constrain how she can decode, turning a relic into a tool. Only the outer Pacific remains a vast blur, but that very vagueness serves the theme of unmappable loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why migration routes vanished—tightens when each tapped rhythm eliminates a false hypothesis, narrowing to the submerged-truth payoff. Pressure is coherent but external; the storm and rising alerts complicate without forcing a counter-move from Elara until the final transcription. A visible price is implied—she must now broadcast evidence that will shred her father’s reputation—yet the on-page cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: inherited denial vs. cyclical redemption, mirrored by the ocean’s “periodically eternal” tides. The atlas page’s shift from nostalgic keepsake to evidence of suppression reweights meaning without moralizing. Subtext resides in the tapping—grief’s metronome—never named as such. Final image reframes prior bleaching witness into active reckoning, achieving resonance through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s marine lexicon—“thermoclines,” “acidified waters”—with syntax that mimics swell rhythm: long sentences rise, then break into fragments at the Morse breakthrough. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. The few dialogue beats are internalized as remembered Morse, keeping voice pure. Minor elevation in diction during the revelation line is justified by the epistemic surge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no paraphrase loops or scaffold. Mixed metaphors are avoided—“ghostly white skeletons” is precise, not ornamental. Information density high: one sentence often conveys sensory data, emotional state, and world rule. Only a single filter-verb cluster (“she realized the rhythms mimicked Morse code”) slightly dulls immediacy at the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of climate-science mystery with filial Morse-code confession feels fresh; the torn atlas page as data-storage device is a specific, non-obvious twist. Risk is taken in the quiet, solitary climax—no whale breach, only a tapped affirmation—yet it pays off by recharging every prior tap. Could edge higher if the submerged-route science were even more particularized.</comment>
