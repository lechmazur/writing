<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s synesthetic quest is vivid and embodied; the moment he whispers his vow while clutching the tag crystallizes interior stakes. Yet the grandfather-map backstory is delivered as summary, not tested under pressure, and no contradictory impulse complicates the final choice—he simply receives the gift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the tag’s shimmer grants synesthetic vision, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise with felt cost (“forever changed”). Causal chain holds: map → dive → library → tag → vow → color burst. Minor drift: the map’s legend status is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Velvet hush, salt-wax air, lantern glow—details are selective and POV-filtered. The sunken library’s warped shelves and moonlit cracks function as micro-setting that constrains breath and movement, charging the final image when lantern light pierces water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“color of sound”—is signaled early and escalates through the dive’s physical risk. The tightening beat is the tag’s activation, which forecloses mere legend and exacts the cost of irreversible perception. Pressure is coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of synesthetic revelation emerges from concrete action; the luminous vows motif evolves from sky lanterns to the tag’s inscription, reweighted at closure. No moralizing; the final image of newly-lit lamps reframes the world without dictating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “meteor hush,” “amber hum,” “sapphire lap.” Perceptual signature stays consistent; no POV leakage. Compression in the dive sequence matches breathless urgency, and the final cadence slows to crystallize the synesthetic gift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous procession,” “meteor hush”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative texture. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic quest fused with submerged-library myth feels fresh; transformation test passes—names and places could not be swapped without loss. Risky underwater air-pocket is justified by dream-logic taught early. One near-echo: “meteor hush” repeats but accrues meaning.</comment>
