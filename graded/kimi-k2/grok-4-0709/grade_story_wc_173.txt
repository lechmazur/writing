<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior tug-of-war—purity as defiance—charges every micro-choice; her bodily grace in the sanctuary threads motivation to action without slip. Motivation crests in the wordless resolve at “between sigh and smile,” earning renunciation cost. Interiority is specific, not label-heavy. Character flaw complicates goal and forces visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens: each untangling act is a because/therefore beat that narrows outcomes and tightens price. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—liberated echoes surge outward, Elara remains but the realm alters—cost felt in the whirlwind of awakening. One coherent scene, no orientation debt. Lens holds to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Snow-rimmed courtyard and prism sanctuary are rendered with vivid sensory precision and constrain tactics—the crystal’s fragility directly shapes Elara’s slow, deliberate untangling. Recurring starlight and “snow crunching” reweight in the final dazzle. Micro-setting (body, crystal threads) guides every move. Environment meets 9-test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Defiance of conformity is pitched early; escalation tightens through each thread released, foreclosing retreat. Agency is Elara’s fingers on crystalline knots—each tug escalates stakes with felt cost. One dominant stake; no reversal beyond final release, but sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: each freed echo reweights silence vs. awakening. Final image reframes the lullaby without sermon. Subtext operates in silence and starlight. Theme coherent, non-binary, resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled; patterned compression taught early (“silver tiles gleamed like frozen mercury”) and sustains. Focalization tightly anchored to Elara; no POV slippage. Syntax modulates pace—the crescendo of released light intensifies rhythm. Dialogue absent; no need. Sensory percept signature distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dense yet clear: metaphor clusters serve pressure, not decoration. No loops or boilerplate; paraphrase is rare. Information density high; each image advances cause. Peak-be clarity holds. Only minor occasional modifier excess; does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Reframing the crystalline memory-harvest as literal ritual fresh; courtesan-as-rebel trope flipped into embodied physical defiance. Specificity of “threads of ancestral whispers” binds lyric and plot. Risky high-style sustained without gimmickry. Derivative traces remain minimal.</comment>
