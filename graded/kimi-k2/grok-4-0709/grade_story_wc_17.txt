<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty to map versus need to unburden—are dramatized in the squeeze through ivy and the trembling recovery of diaries; the final vow rewrites legacy as shared narrative with visible cost of solitude intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “the burden…lightened” because she reframes legacy from solitary weight to communal guide; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each echo-dense beat thickens toward this crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ivy-choked corridor and dripping fireplace are not backdrop; they narrow her body, muffle sound, and deliver the scorched diaries that catalyze the final reconfiguration—setting as active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—lighten inherited burden—tightens when charred pages force a choice: retreat with fragments or press on; the deepening is her decision to “chart redemptions,” paying the cost of reopening ancestral wounds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of shared versus solitary legacy emerges through the diaries’ regret and her final vow; no moralizing, only the charged image of resonators still humming with “newfound data” that reweights the past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“echoes bounced like ghosts,” “humid air that now blanketed everything”—with perceptual signature attuned to vibration; no POV drift, rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked modifiers (“thick, dripping foliage that muffled”) risk overwriting yet serve atmospheric pressure; no loops or scaffold, strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate-gothic ruin explored via acoustic cartography; the “walls dream” conceit is not gimmick but engine for legacy’s reconfiguration, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
