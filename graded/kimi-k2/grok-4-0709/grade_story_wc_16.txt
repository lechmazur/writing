<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied, tense micro-choices around the ink-well anchor her contradictions; the risk and care both show up in how she steadies her hand yet presses the quill too far. Silence-as-shield is dramatized through the symphony’s playback to Thorne, a real-time cost paid on the page. The final embrace retains ambiguity rather than tidy redemption, a restrained but credible earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is the symphonic revelation—Thorne’s on-stage witnessing that unravels prior misreadings—framed as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the cost of separation still visible at dawn. Causal linkage is accumulative/textural: each promise added to the ink-well rises in density until the chords reweight the emotional currency; no causality slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The archive air itself tightens choices—proximity of fungi-lit shelves, rune-etched parchment cracking beneath fingers—grounding every incantation and limiting Elara’s movements. The ink-well’s facets refracted off page are the micro-object that constrains the final harmonic act, fully credited under micro-setting rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes—“restore trust before dawn”—are vocalized early and tightened each time new promise-ink saturates the air. One clear deepening occurs: the third inscription transforms a looming dismissal into compelled witness, narrowing Thorne’s options from leave to listen. Cost is the dawn’s actual departure, irrevocable once sun shafts strike.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Trust refracted through extinct speech emerges by accumulation rather than lecture; the finale reweights “truths harmonize eternally” without sermon. Ambiguity persists: the music does not exonerate, it clarifies past silence and costs them daylight to repair it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distanced-third slips seamlessly into free-indirect when bioluminescent threads become “iridescent liquid that responded to ancient phonetics,” a perceptual signature fused to Elara’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates under ritual stress, then softens into the hush following the final chord—no head-hop, no canned lyric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information-dense but uncluttered: “parchment crackling like autumn leaves” performs double duty — sensory specificity plus foreshadowed loss. One paraphrase loop around “cautious exuberance” costs momentum and prevents 9+. Otherwise clean under tight scrutiny.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>A wholly fresh frame—melody as lie-detective—transfigures the trope of mistranslated prophecy into emotional forensics. The extinct language archive reeks of lived practice, not set dressing, lifting the premise beyond gimmick at minimal length.</comment>
