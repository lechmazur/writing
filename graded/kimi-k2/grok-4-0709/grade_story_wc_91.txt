<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet generosity and interior contradiction (destitute yet giving) are embodied in the act of carrying the jars; the final renunciation of his last treasure carries visible cost. Mira functions only as a catalyst, so relationship crucible is minimal. Interiority is specific but occasionally drifts toward gentle abstraction (“texture of transformation”).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lightning-bug release crystallizes Elias’s shift from planned gift to communal salvation, with the beach runes confirming the cost of his emptied satchel. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of coincidences thickens until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Black sand, volcanic glow, and celestial alignment are vivid and selective; the beach’s hidden runes become the micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (bugs’ light revealing lever and runes). Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s last act of giving—tightens when the detour forces him to spend his treasure to save Mira; the cost is the emptied satchel and the new identity of inadvertent prophet. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-as-quiet-hush emerges organically from Elias’s embodied choices; prophecy is subverted rather than preached. Final image of bugs merging with starlight offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the prophecy’s whispered hush carries implication rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet grounded (“worn boots sinking into the ashen soil”). Rhythm modulates with emotional beats; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial bodies continued their languid dance”) edges toward overwriting. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar trope of reluctant prophet is refreshed by the destitute philanthropist angle and the bioluminescent bug motif. Specificity of volcanic beach and celestial alignment anchors the mythic frame. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent.</comment>
