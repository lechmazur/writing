<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied; the brass pull anchors his guilt and resolve in tactile beats. His micro-choice to use the relic as key to both prisoners’ bonds crystallizes the arc. The apology/forgiveness limbo supplies credible internal cost. Minor: Kara and Ronan remain functional silhouettes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc holds: misjudgment → lunar synchronization → flawless swap → earned stir of absolution. Orientation is immediate; stakes tighten when the moon reaches zenith and the ropes fall. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias pockets the pull, the cost of vigilance still palpable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The parapet’s wind, salt, and decay are filtered through Elias’s vigilance and physically constrain stance and timing. The brass pull doubles as micro-setting; its emerald eyes glint against the mist, charging the final image. Weather and stone guide every tactical step without ornamental drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—redemption via flawless exchange—tightens as moon phase narrows the window. One meaningful escalation: ropes fall, prisoners cross, delegations retreat, leaving Elias in charged poise. Cost is felt in the hush that follows; no luck resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of recycling regret into wisdom emerges through the ritualized use of the relic and lunar impartiality. Subtext lives in the silence after the swap; no moral is stated. Final image of the pocketed pull reweights the premise: wisdom is portable, but absolution remains provisional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is weather-beaten and contemplative. Syntax tightens under moonrise pressure—“furrowed hush,” “storm’s subdued roar.” Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and tonally consistent with the hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“brass warmed by his touch”) serves character stakes. Sentence lengths modulate with wind gusts and heartbeats. Clean mechanics; zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—neutral ground prisoner swap—is refreshed by lunar synchronization ritual and relic-as-key. The brass pull’s genealogy and emerald eyes feel particular, not token. Risk taken in quiet, lyric closure pays off: no grand speech, only the hush bearing cost.</comment>
