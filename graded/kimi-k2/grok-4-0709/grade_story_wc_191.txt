<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her pulse-accelerated climb, but interior contradiction is thin; the “wisely adventurous” trait is asserted more than dramatized. Micro-choice at the mural peeling is sharp, yet the cost of claiming the throne feels abstract rather than personally scarring. The final merge is earned, but the emotional price is generalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s claim reconfigures Neo-Elysium’s memory flow, with the ruby flake as persistent constraint. Causal chain—flake → murals → stairway → throne—holds under a Causal lens. Sunrise deadline tightens options; the final image of sealed waterfall carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Neon spires, rusted megastructures, and bio-luminescent orchard are vivid and selective, filtering through Elara’s nostalgic ache. The orchard’s engineered Eden constrains her path and charges the final ascent. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore balance via the throne—is signaled early and tightened by the sunrise clock. Escalation occurs through peeling murals that reveal the stairway, narrowing options. Cost is visible in the irreversible merge with the throne, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of weaving past into future emerges from Elara’s tactile interaction with history’s layers rather than exposition. Final image of renewed harmony resonates without moralizing. Subtext in the orchard’s synthetic rain vs. real soil deepens the nostalgic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, modulating from archive hush to orchard hush to ascendant hush. Sensory specificity (“synthetic rain and real soil”) is POV-bound. No head-hopping; compression in the stairway ascent is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmic and dense, with occasional ornamental flourish (“kaleidoscopic waterfall”) that never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor (“plasma core” for motivation) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar cyber-arcana tropes are refreshed through the peeling-paint method and ruby-flake compass. The fusion of monarchic relic with post-collapse tech feels inevitable. Risk in lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
