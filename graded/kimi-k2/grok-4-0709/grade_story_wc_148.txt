<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is visceral—salt regret and copperlight doubt under the skin—and every step, from scuff-reading the door to brushing the lattice, is motive-driven. The father-legacy flaw is not told but acted upon; Elias confesses the bloodline lie through ritual rather than rumination and the renunciation feels earned and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Story holds Accumulative/Textural lens: because he climbs, reads scuffs, speaks into lattice, the density accrues until the final copper night yields Charged Poise—his ghosts fade into that calm while the rising tide locks the bodies’ discovery. Causality remains legible and closure lands on page with undeniable social cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse’s rusted grate, scuff-scarred door, and chapel lattice anchor every choice. Their shifting metallic light actually constrains approach and timing, charging the final departure image.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“thread truth before bodies rise”—is signaled at entry and drives every beat. The lattice confession is a single, decisive tightening that forecloses further deceit, paying a social cost when the ghosts dissolve and Elias rows into incriminating calm.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of inherited lies: the prison of false stories can only be demolished by a new, publicly spoken truth. The lattice’s empty grid offers no absolution, only responsibility—Copper hush reframes legacy without moralizing.</comment>

<comment>Voice is richly textured—sentence rhythm mimics tide-beat breath—yet never slips register. Copperlight, “rust-gnawed gulls,” and salt-heavy hush are specific to this POV’s sensory catalog.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>No loop or scaffold; every sentence carries double duty (action + atmosphere). “Gouges from desperate nails, boot kicks from guards” is concrete, propelling, and precise. Density holds without overwriting, clarity remains surgical through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The “son-of-crier-of-wolves” re-threads the fable into gothic-nowhere realism, making the inherited fable an internal curse rather than cautionary tale. Fresh, not gimmick, and fully integrated into setting and closure.</comment>
