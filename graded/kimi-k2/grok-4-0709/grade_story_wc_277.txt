<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, the “solemn playfulness” of twirling the pen—but the shift from passive observation to active intervention is asserted rather than dramatized; the journalist remains off-stage, so relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final resolve feels earned, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: call → reflection → proof by contradiction → invitation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise (“intervention felt like freedom”) with conceptual cost. One transition (call to observatory) is clean and within scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory’s echoing dome and star-wheel amplify every whisper, grounding the POV in a tactile, atmospheric pressure cooker. The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting that constrains her drafting of the proof, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defending family honor—tightens when the journalist’s accusation forces Elara to act. Agency is decision (inviting the journalist), narrowing options and foreclosing passive silence. Cost is the risk of public exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of regret’s gravitational pull emerges organically through the “orbits” motif and the proof-by-contradiction device. Final image of breaking the orbit offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to astronomical metaphor and ink-stained legacy. Compression and patterned elision (“orbits of regret”) are taught early and paid off at the end without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“comet’s tail streaking through the night”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The astronomical framing of family scandal feels fresh; the proof-by-contradiction as narrative engine is an inventive twist on the investigative trope. Specificity of the rosewood nib and echoing dome anchors the concept.</comment>
