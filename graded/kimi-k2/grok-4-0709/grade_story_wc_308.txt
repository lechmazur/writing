<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the skimmer’s centuries of vigilance and weathered resolve are palpable. Motivation to “navigate without moving” is rooted in the canyon’s dislodged pulse and drives the final stillness. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the skimmer’s motionless attunement reconfigures the quest from chase to harmonic draw. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each descriptive layer tightens the cadence toward stillness. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of physical pursuit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bone towers, dust, and spectral ravens are vividly selective and filter through the skimmer’s reverent perception. The arrowhead and canyon constrain his choice to sit motionless, charging the final image. Micro-setting (arrowhead against forehead) functions as intimate terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the wandering pulse—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: layered dust and trembling towers intensify the cost of stillness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the skimmer renounces motion; price is the surrender of centuries-old habit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-through-stillness emerges from the skimmer’s embodied practice and the canyon’s tremor, never stated. Final image of hushed echoes reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the arrowhead’s faint hum and the ravens’ silent dispersal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is weathered, ceremonial, and rhythmically controlled; diction like “historically reverent traditions” feels authentic to the skimmer’s lineage. Compression and patterned elision (“centuries of layered dust shifted softly”) are taught early and paid off in the hush before closure. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined and purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing (“monuments to bygone eras”) fits the mythic register. No loops or mixed metaphors; final cadence slows to mirror stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses geomythic landscape with sonic metaphysics in a way that feels inevitable. The harmonic stone-skimming tradition and pulse-as-heartbeat are fresh syntheses. Risky stillness-as-action is fully committed to and pays off.</comment>
