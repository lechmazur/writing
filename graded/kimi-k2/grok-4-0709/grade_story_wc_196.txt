<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s wounded archivist persona is crisp—dust under fingernails, divorce ache shaping every micro-choice. Interiority oscillates between archival precision and raw grief in embodied beats: the tremor before touching Josiah’s folder is the mirror of the tremor before opening her ex-husband’s note. Tactful hope not asserted but lived out in the slow unfolding, earning a credible shift from refuge-seeker to active mender; cost is felt in the moment she replaces the folder, brushing away the dust anew.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene accretive arc: inciting curiosity (dust trails) → revelation (button & Josiah) → personal echo → decisive digitization. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: archive room hums not as tomb but healing vessel; the lens stays textural-accumulative (dust patterns deepen meaning without causal plot turns). Causality tidy: dust guides archaeologist as it once guided earlier researcher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Room is organism: dim Gothic lighting, mildew scent, brittle ledger edges cutting fingers. The foster-files grid subtly cages choice—proximity forces her to select Josiah’s folder. Dust is texture and clue; it speaks of unseen hands, making setting active antagonist rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove one kindness can stitch a broken soul. Escalation flows through discovery (Josiah’s kindness) → parallel (soldier’s gift) → decision (digitize). No external antagonist; pressure is internal and archival, tightening as evidence accumulates. Cost legible: each revelation deepens emotional toll; final decision forecloses anonymity, commits her public redemptive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme unfurls organically: small kindnesses echo across centuries, offering non-bitter reply to divorce pain. Final image—dim room humming with new possibility—reconfigures “unknown history” as active balm. Subtext: past kindness steals oxygen from private despair; no tidy moral, only a charged poise that survivors mend by transmission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist’s synesthetic dust, the faint lavender mildew of aged paper. Voice modulates under pressure: crisp ledger speak skews tender when handling Josiah’s button. Rhythm accelerates between beats, breaths in sensory pause. No head-hopping, psychic distance stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose muscular, concrete: “ledger edges brittle, brittle as her marriage vows.” Sparse modifiers; strong verbs. No loops; ellipsis taught early through dust trails. One minor filter-verb cluster in reflection beat (−0.3). Information density high; every sentence grounds choice or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Throws familiar archive-in-trauma template through specific orphan-Union-soldier vignette. Button not generic but talismaned with aphorism “fight for kindness.” Quiet pivot from healing self to public healing reads fresh. Mild deduction for concept overlap with other Reconstruction archive stories.</comment>
