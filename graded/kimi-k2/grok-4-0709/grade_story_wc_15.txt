<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—aching for ruin yet buoyed by “eerie faith”—is embodied in her tranced stitching; the cost is the irreversible surrender of waking agency each night. Motivation stays rooted in lineage and place, but the sleepwalking device externalizes her flaw so cleanly that the final “threads in her hands” feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s new bridges and gardens reweight the premise from isolation to pilgrimage. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each overlapping path adds density until the final dawn image crystallizes the cost: Elara wakes “with threads in her hands,” evidence of labor she cannot recall.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The red canyon walls, bioluminescent moss, and barren tide pools are filtered through Elara’s poetic perception; the labyrinth’s geography literally channels the sleepwalking paths, constraining every stitch. Final image of the wharf-turned-altar recharges the opening decay with reverence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform ruin into reverence—tightens as each somnambulant intersection forecloses isolation and demands communal weaving. Cost is the nightly loss of conscious choice, legible in the dawn-after exhaustion and the irreversible alterations to the canyon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mending broken precedents emerges from the concrete act of sewing while asleep; no moral is stated, yet the final altar-mural reframes ancestral failure as living tapestry. Subtext hums in the unspoken pact among sleepwalkers who never meet awake.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, its cadence mirroring tidal pull and trance rhythm. Compression like “orchid solace” teaches the pattern early; the final hush of “the canyon breathed easier” pays it off without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves the trance state without purple overload. No loops or scaffold; each image (salt-tolerant vines, bioluminescent moss) advances atmosphere and stakes simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sleepwalking communal weave is a fresh, non-obvious solution to the “mending the world” trope; risk lies in the lyric non-linear structure, yet it coheres under the Accumulative lens. Specificity of canyon flora and ancestral ruins prevents template drift.</comment>
