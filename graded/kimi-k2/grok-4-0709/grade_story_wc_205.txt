<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—revolutionary nostalgia vs. present scavenger—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (covering mirrors, clutching shard). The final renunciation of active rebellion for elegiac reimagination is earned and carries visible cost: “a fragile victory amid the stars.” Interiority stays concrete, though occasional lyric summary edges toward performed sorrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes from failed rebel to elegist, cost paid in “burnished sorrow.” Causal chain holds—storm → mirror method → legible shard → reimagined narrative—without gaps. Orientation is swift; baroque asteroid and visible time are anchored by line 3. One minor ellipsis: how the shard’s code is instantly legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid is more than backdrop; its “filigreed ruins” and temporal storms physically constrain tactics (mirror-covering, chamber sanctuary). The shard’s facets catch temporal glow, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography remains coherent. Environment subtly mirrors Elias’s internal decay without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the civilization’s tyranny via the shard—tightens once the storm forces the mirror-covering gambit, narrowing options to either lose the evidence or insulate it. Cost is felt: Elias trades revolutionary action for elegiac truth. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of opulence masking oppression emerges organically from shard’s decoded lament and Elias’s mirrored regret. Final image—asteroid as “burnished mirror to his soul”—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shard’s silent accusation and Elias’s quiet acceptance of elegy over revolt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that modulates under temporal storm pressure. Distinct perceptual signature: Elias’s poetic diction colors every observation (“gilded arches twisted like forgotten sonnets”). No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but stays character-true.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (e.g., “dust-moted light, lay a shard… frozen tears”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent, though “burnished sorrow” recurs enough to risk minor repetition. Final cadence slows to crystallize closure without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Visible time as temporal storms and mirror superstition is a fresh synthesis; baroque asteroid setting feels singular. The shard’s coded lament reframes familiar “fallen empire” trope through Elias’s elegiac lens. Risky lyric density pays off in charged final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
