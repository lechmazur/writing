<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s longing for her mother’s lost voice is palpable and drives every step; the moment she sings to free the echoes crystallizes her arc with felt cost. Interiority is concrete (“ache in her soul,” “sharp against her palm”) and embodied. Yet the final renunciation of trapping echoes is slightly under-motivated—no prior beat shows her weighing control versus release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: seashell clue → forked path → confrontation → revelation → release. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Thorne’s web undone by song, the nexus re-tuned. The Orientation Test is met by line 4; no drift. One micro-turn (Thorne’s partial confession) tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>“Serpentine nexus under starlight” is immediately anchored and later constrains movement; the seashell’s sharp edge literally cuts Elara’s palm, charging the final union. Sensory detail is selective—wind through reeds, stone vibration—filtered through Elara’s ear for echoes. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“why some echo”—is signaled early and escalates when Thorne admits guardians decide. One decisive tightening: Elara must choose to keep or free the echoes; her song costs Thorne’s power and her own certainty. Agency is hers; coincidence never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: completed songs fade, unfinished ones linger—no moralizing. The seashell’s whispers and the canyon’s hum braid into a meditation on letting go. Final image of freed echoes reweights the mother’s silence as peace, not loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is auditory, attuned to “reed-blown melancholy.” Thorne’s diction carries guarded resonance, distinct from Elara’s softer cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet lean; metaphors (“webs of intrigue,” “reed-blown melancholy”) recur with purpose. One minor loop: “echoing faintly, mirroring the very phenomenon she pursued” restates the obvious. Otherwise rhythm modulates with tension, and no artifacts touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The echo-as-judgment conceit feels fresh, reframing afterlife folklore through acoustic metaphor. Risk is taken—cosmic guardians bound by conch shards—yet the logic holds. Specificity of “canyon echo singer” roots the myth in a lived occupation.</comment>
