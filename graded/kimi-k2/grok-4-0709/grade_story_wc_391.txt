<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—restrained wildness vs. patient strategist—drives every micro-choice; the final magnetized pulse is earned by her prior mapping and the visible cost of holding the exiles’ rage in check. One slip: “impatience transformed into enduring strength” edges toward label-speak just before closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the quiet pulse of signals reweights the entire horizon she has mapped, with the felt cost of her own wildness still caged. Causal linkage holds—moon paths → viaduct → encoded liberation—without gaps or teleportation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and rain-awakened viaduct are not backdrop; they constrain routes, amplify magnetism, and mirror Elara’s inner freeze. The final reflection of moonlight on ice recharges the opening image with new stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpt patience from impatience—tightens when the rain awakens the viaduct, forcing the first irreversible act. Cost is legible: the wildness she leashes remains unspent, a future liability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between wild impulse and patient erosion; the final image of moonlight on the frozen lake offers a non-literal answer—liberation without spectacle. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and specific to Elara’s perceptual signature—“blade sheathed in silk,” “lunar light like a conduit.” No head-hopping; compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers atmosphere, stakes, or tactic. One minor loop—“restrained wildness” appears twice in close succession—keeps it from perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of geomancy, lunar cartography, and quiet insurgency feels fresh; the magnetic viaduct as clandestine telegraph is a specific, non-obvious invention that reweights the premise. Risky restraint over spectacle pays off.</comment>
