<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning to “learn the rhythm of repair” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—uncapping the gear, arranging cogs on the ice—yet interiority drifts into nostalgic summary rather than live contradiction; the final image crystallizes her earned stance with visible cost (tears freeze), satisfying the 9+ quick test despite some reflective padding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: uncapping the gear releases temporal mist that reweights her future options. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mirrored gears and memories tightens until the cadence shift syncs heartbeat to mechanism. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are not mere backdrop; the mirrors multiply her efforts into “an infinite workshop,” constraining tactics and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—ice-crusted windows, spectral flames—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. One minor slip: “distant morning” remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tightened when the uncapped gear forces a sync with her heartbeat, foreclosing retreat. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density rather than causal reversals; the cost (frozen tears, irreversible knowledge) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of mending time emerges from concrete particulars—brass cogs, lunar locks—without moralizing. The final image of future selves mastering eclipses offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Nostalgia is textured, not abstract, though a few lines edge toward poetic abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical compression, moonlit lexicon, rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s locksmith gaze. No head-hopping or register drift; purposeful elision (e.g., “bottled memory”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. Minor loop risk in “nostalgic drift” phrasing, but no artifact touches the closure beat. Sentence rhythm mirrors the gear-turning cadence, accelerating toward the uncapping.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith trope is transformed through tactile specificity—runes on cogs, salt-scented mist—creating a fresh synthesis. Risky lyric structure holds coherence under the Accumulative lens. No derivative echoes; the premise commits fully.</comment>
