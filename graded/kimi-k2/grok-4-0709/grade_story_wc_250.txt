<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s half-spoken secret and the guardian’s wordless instruction create credible interior stakes; the final whispered confession is earned by the preceding spiral of light. The guardian’s “spiralingly calm” presence is consistent yet slightly archetypal, lacking a unique flaw or contradiction that would push this into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the dental-mirror pattern teaches its rule early and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara’s confession releases the stillwater tension. Closure is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the cost being the irrevocable admission and the guardian’s silent judgment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock’s rain-slick planks and mirrored puddles constrain footing and perception, while the boathouse shutters become an active tool in the light-weaving; the final star-patterns charge the closure image. Sensory economy is tight, though the canal’s “swirling undercurrents” remain more atmospheric than causally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s need to confess without words—tightens through the guardian’s escalating light lesson; the spiral of pinprick stars forces the decisive whisper. Cost is felt in the irreversible social admission, though the external stakes (consequences with the betrayed friend) remain off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of darkness taught by stars emerges organically from the mirrored-light choreography; the final constellation reweights betrayal into possibility without moralizing. Subtext operates in the guardian’s silence and Elara’s tear-tracked nod, avoiding explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s biased perception; the guardian’s interior remains legitimately opaque. Prose rhythm modulates with tension—longer cadences under stillness, clipped fragments at the confession—creating a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lines are dense and propulsive; “spiralingly calm” risks mild repetition but serves as motif glue. No loops or mixed metaphors; the mirrored-light imagery stays coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“stellar brilliance”) momentarily lifts register but does not obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The silent guardian wielding a dental mirror to teach ethics via shutter-constellations is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight yet avoids gimmickry; slight risk of archetype keeps it below the 8.8 gate.</comment>
