<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. isolation) are dramatized through the fresco fragment and light-painting. The final renunciation—choosing to feed the network rather than hoard the joy—carries visible cost (“feeding back into it”). Minor slip: “pensive mirth” is asserted more than enacted in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of light-painted memory thickens the orchard’s atmosphere and reweights the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s smile on waking crystallizes the cost of sharing joy. One transition (daydream → waking) is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard is not backdrop; its fog and skeletal branches constrain visibility and force Elara to paint with light rather than pigment. The fresco fragment and glowing root-veins act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover lost joy—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the joy must be shared to endure. One meaningful deepening: from private retrieval to communal gift. Cost is legible in the thinning fog and her relinquishing sole ownership.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory versus solitary nostalgia emerges through action, not statement. The final image—orchard murals feeding a shared dream-network—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the “whisper from antiquity” avoids overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through an artist’s eye (“paint with light,” “diffused light filtering through the fog”). Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression in the final paragraph is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught (“exposed film suddenly developed”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“branches clawing…like fingers grasping for lost time”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>The synthesis of fresco-as-film and orchard-as-network feels inevitable in hindsight. Light-painting in a dream-orchard is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final Charged Poise.</comment>
