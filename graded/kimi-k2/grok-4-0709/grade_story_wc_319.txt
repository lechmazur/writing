<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian’s contradictory impulses—feral instinct vs. scholar’s longing—are embodied in its clawed grasp of the pendant and the growl that acknowledges transformation. Interiority is concrete (“dimensionally homesick,” “ache of displacement”) and drives the micro-choice to interiorize the garden. The Earned Stasis—accepting exile by folding the garden inward—carries visible cost: the pendant cools, dawn arrives, exile remains. Flaws (feral solitude, cosmic displacement) shape every beat; no safety-hedging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the guardian’s stance crystallizes when it rises “ready to guard… with renewed vigor,” the cost being eternal exile made bearable by internalized mist. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fold of frost into mind deepens the stake until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“frozen garden”), transitions are seamless, no causality breaks. Pendant’s rule-set is taught early and reweighted at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen garden, mist, iced petals, and the pendant’s obsidian facets constrain every choice; the garden literally folds into corridors of thought. Sensory hierarchy favors chill and glow, mirroring internal displacement. Spatial choreography is coherent—vines become corridors, moon unseen yet felt. Final image recharges the setting: external desolation now internal warmth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—soothe homesickness via friendship with uncertainty—is signaled early and tightened through each fold of mist into mind. Agency is the deliberate act of waiting-as-interiorizing; cost is the irreversible acceptance of exile. No external antagonist needed; pressure is existential and coherent. One deepening suffices: “What if displacement was not loss but transformation?” crystallizes stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: exile reframed as transformation through deliberate embrace of uncertainty. Subtext lives in gesture—the cooling pendant, the soft growl—not exposition. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: “Uncertainty… walked beside it like an old friend.” No thematic drift; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is feral-scholar hybrid: “shadowy amalgamation of fur and forgotten tomes,” rhythmic, compressed, never generic. Perceptual signature filters every detail through guardian’s longing—aurora-tinted shelves glimpsed in obsidian. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Prose texture mirrors liminal sleep-veil state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences advance story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective—“light refracting through haze”—and never muddles peak beats. Rhythm breathes with pressure: long sentences for waiting, fragments for ignition of runes. No register drift; diction stays within guardian’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—feral librarian guardian in soul-garden folding exile inward—is non-obvious synthesis of cosmic displacement and introspective magic. Tropes (guardian, relic, mist) are transformed through embodied specificity: fur-and-tome hybrid, pendant as portal, frost as archive. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
