<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her “whimsical flair” and “quietly burning” motive anchor her—but the story never dramatizes an internal contradiction under pressure; her choices feel frictionless. The collective unlearners remain silhouettes, so relationship crucible is absent. The final smile is earned, yet the cost is diffuse rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the mandala + tile reconfigure the group’s stance, producing a resonant hush. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern shift charge the ending. Orientation is swift; no causal gaps. Cost is felt in the “tentative peace,” but a sharper forfeiture would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s lilac mist is not mere backdrop; it thickens with tension and literally parts at the climax, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography stays coherent. Micro-setting (tile flake) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—is signaled early and tightened through the mandala ritual. Pressure escalates as lilac unease intensifies and whispers crescendo. Agency lies in Elara’s interjection and the group’s co-creation. Cost is diffuse; a more concrete loss would sharpen the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: connection born from shared chaos. Subtext lives in gesture—sand spirals mirror inner spirals—avoiding moralizing. Final image of “tentative peace” reweights prior lilac dread. Complexity is honored; no tidy moral is imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; lilac-tinged diction stays consistent. POV is stable single-camera. Rhythm modulates with scene tension. Dialogue is sparse but natural when present. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; sentences advance both image and pressure. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“echoes danced like ghosts”) serve atmosphere without clutter. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “unlearning” frame and whispering-gallery tile offer fresh angles on familiar seeker-grotto motifs. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without these specifics. Risk is moderate; a bolder structural gamble could push higher.</comment>
