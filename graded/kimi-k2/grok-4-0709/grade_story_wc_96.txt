<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s molting trait is embodied in the itch and the shift to “fierce gardener of anarchy,” but the interior contradiction between wanderer and rebel is asserted more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (Jax’s death, the tin’s legacy) and the micro-choice to scatter seeds anchors the new persona.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s shift from grave to “cathedral of potential” is legible and charged; the causal chain (Jax → tin → seeds → beacon) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the moon’s fracture sealing the vow as felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library’s iron shelves and caved roof constrain movement and supply cracks for planting; the coffee tin’s dented halo under moonlight charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate by fusing setting and object into the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—tightens when Elias renounces passive wandering to plant rebellion; the cost is Jax’s death and the risk of execution, visible in the seed-scattering act that forecloses anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of blooming resistance emerges through concrete acts (seeds in cracks, poems as calls to arms) rather than statement; the final image of the library humming with potential offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—“rusted library under stars,” “luminous fracture”—with perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s vagrant-poet diction; no head-hopping, and rhythmic modulation under pressure (recitation echoing off beams) heightens the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“silver fractures,” “fractured luminescence”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative lens; no loops or scaffold, and the final line’s cadence seals the vow cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of monthly personality molts, contraband coffee tin, and seed-sown rebellion feels fresh and inevitable; the risk of lyric density pays off by charging the closure image without obscuring stakes.</comment>
