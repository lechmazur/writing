<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s swallowed-truth motive is vivid and embodied; the fever’s aftermath gives visceral stakes. Yet her interiority drifts toward poetic abstraction (“auroral sorrow of lost years”) that blurs contradictory impulse. Thorne remains a cipher—his “fault-tolerant” nature is asserted, not dramatized—so the relational crucible is thin. Final renunciation is earned, cost visible in the lighter exhale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; orientation is swift. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the smudged margin crystallizes the weight of truth under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No causality breaks, but the oracle’s prophecy mechanics are exposited rather than tested, a minor slip. Cost is legible in the “lighter now” breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Mountain station is atmospherically rich—thin air, solar-panel creaks, auroral light—yet it never physically constrains choice. The botanical illustration becomes the micro-setting that matters, its margins literally guiding action. Sensory selection mirrors Elara’s narrowed post-fever perception. A hairline slip: altitude sickness fades without residual debility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—measuring the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightened once via the smudge. Agency is contemplative, not active, but the choice to smudge forecloses denial. Pressure is coherent but static; no external antagonist raises stakes beyond memory. Cost is felt, though muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth’s immeasurable mass emerges through image, not statement. The botanical scale offers conceptual repricing: grief quantified in auroral hues. Subtext resides in peripheral vision and ink bleed. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in Thorne’s unreadable gaze.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual signature—auroral sorrow, frost on glass. Syntax modulates with fever’s ebb. Thorne’s diction is distinctively oracular without slipping into cliché. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens at the smudge beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of loops. Occasional elevated diction (“auroral sorrow,” “swaying certainties”) risks purple but stays purposeful. No artifacts in closure beat. One paraphrase loop around “swallowed truth” early on, minor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of meteorological station and mystical oracle feels fresh; fault-tolerant prophecy is a novel angle. Botanical-as-scale device is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode succeeds without gimmickry. Derivative echoes absent.</comment>
