<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s credibly curious humility is embodied in silent chart-checks, frayed wiring repair, and the decisive refusal to ring the bell; the slight reserve stems from reflection lines that tilt present choice but stay just below the 20 % ceiling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the chosen Causal lens the glue-drying wait drives the zero-hour moment; Elias’s switch from rope yank to silent reading reconfigures the stakes with felt conceptual cost when villages remain un-alarmed, producing a clean earned stasis without slips.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sanctuary itself—wind, altitude, bell rope, gauges—constrains every tactical choice and charges the final image of clouds parting; selective sensory detail breathes with Elias’s sensor flicks; the single slip is a near-generic “storm front,” yet the shelter’s stone remains palpable throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—protect the villages via silence rather than clamor—escalates through micro-turn when Elias discards the siren option; pressure coheres under causal logic and carries visible cost: a bell left untolled, a life-path chosen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme crystallizes from event: silence as vigilance earns safety; subtext dwells in rope dust motes and anemometer hum rather than statement; no late moralizing, only the hushed solstice carrying re-weighted understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Consistent third-person intimate voice threads meteorological lexicon through perceptually biased noticing; rhythm breathes with wind gusts, no head-hops or register drift; occasional compression taught early pays off in quiet closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm mirrors wind surges; concise noun-verb pairings (“siren’s frayed wiring,” “wind howled softly”); isolated template run (“now, with the solstice sun dipping low”) keeps damage below –0.2, leaving clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusing monastery relic with storm-warning tech provides fresh friction; transformation rests on character decision, not gadget twist; avoidance of siren-blast heroics stakes out quiet originality.</comment>
