<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s adaptive trait shows in following frost patterns instead of grand gestures; the cost—accepting the family legacy and using smuggled charcoal to make new light—is legible at closure. Interiority is sensuous and embodied ("molten glass," "icy crust," "shattered remnants"), but the "discover purpose in the pauses" motivation is somewhat abstract, risking therapeutic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The frost-cipher device provides coherent causal linkage between past, present, and found pigments; closure lands in RR—Elara now sees her lineage’s “coal into light” transformation as earned inheritance. Orientation is locked by the campfire and canyon at outset; no temporal slips undermine legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Frost lines and charcoal dust charge choices; the hidden crevice and pigment vials physically constrain next moves. Sensory density is high yet selective; frost “crystalline veins” both route and mirror internal fracture. Environment directly governs how she deciphers and acts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early—survive fire, understand testament—but tension is poetic rather than acute; the frost pattern decipher is one meaningful narrowing of options. Cost appears when she pockets the ledger as talisman, acknowledging smuggler bloodline and committing to its transformation into art.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Theme of refracting darkness into artwork emerges from concrete beats—ledger strip, pigments, grandmother’s note—avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is carried in handling of materials; refusal to condense into simple generational guilt gives the piece useful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Lush, glass-artist syntax mirrors fractured light; metaphors stay rooted in her craft. Compression is purposeful: "luminous remnants," "drifting resonance echoed her fractured thoughts." Voice never detours into omniscient exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Craft is musical: long breaths in starlight, short cracks of ice underfoot. One paraphrased phrase—“shattered remnants” / “remnants herself”—is audible only once; momentum doesn’t stall. Final image of pigments glowing inside scorched box lifts climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Frost-cipher as wayfinding feels fresh, inheriting smuggler legacy re-imagined not as guilt but as raw material—charcoal to light. The premise could risk sentimentality, but grounded craft keeps it distinct; no genre clichés reused unaltered.</comment>
