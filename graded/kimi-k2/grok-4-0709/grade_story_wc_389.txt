<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “lyrically prophetic” voice is embodied in murmured verses and callused fingers on dials—but the shift from isolated hermit to movement-leader is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the cost of his variant allegiance. No secondary character applies direct pressure, so the crucible is purely internal; the contradiction between scientific past and prophetic present is stated more than enacted in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s final broadcast crystallizes his stance and births a movement, with the cracked cobalt glass portico as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly tuning session deepens pattern and stakes—yet causality between the last vision and the pilgrims’ arrival is elided, a minor ellipsis that keeps the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and cobalt portico are rendered with tactile specificity—glass humming with static, lightning strobing—and the cracked panes at the end physically mirror the fragmented revelations, constraining Elias’s safety and charging the final image. Weather and altitude pressure every beat, grounding the lyric flights in grit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harnessing ancient shadows to shape a new dawn—is signaled early and escalates through each decoded fragment, tightening Elias’s variant allegiance from human causes to cosmic cycles. The cost is legible in the spider-webbed glass and the pilgrims’ arrival, but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the decisive trade-off, keeping tension just shy of the 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of renewal through decay emerges organically from Elias’s nightly rituals and the final image of cracked glass birthing light; no moral is stated. The refrain “we shape the morrow with yesterday’s shade” reweights earlier fragments without sermonizing, though the lyric mode edges close to overt statement once or twice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, storm-charged—and the perceptual signature (radio static as “spectral echoes,” rain-lashed glass blurring reality) remains consistent. No dialogue appears, so the interior monologue carries the load without register drift; the final cadence modulates perfectly with the storm’s roar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, with purposeful repetition (“shadows,” “dawn,” “whimsy”) that accumulates texture rather than loops. A few stacked metaphors (“sapphire wound,” “lightning shards”) flirt with overwriting but serve the lyric mode; no clarity is lost at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—prophet forged from antique radio ghosts—feels fresh, and the synthesis of wartime Morse with nomadic chants is specific to Elias’s arc. While the “lonely visionary on mountaintop” frame is familiar, the treatment through fragmented frequencies and variant allegiance transforms it; risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
