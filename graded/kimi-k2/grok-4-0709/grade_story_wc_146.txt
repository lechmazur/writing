<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains largely abstract—his “obsidian eyes” and “cryptic smiles” tell rather than embody. The single POV keeps focus, yet we never feel his struggle under pressure; patience reads as trait, not lived cost. No contradictory impulse surfaces in scene, so the final renunciation feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Thorne slips away as the town revives, leaving a resonant after-image of balance restored. However, the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural, and the final cost is diffuse—felt by the town, not visibly paid by Thorne. The causality between footsteps and revival is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The valley’s “wild hush” and the archway’s runes are vivid and selective, filtering through Thorne’s ritual. The cobblestones evolve from dead surface to living metronome, constraining every step. Micro-setting—the tuning fork against stone—charges the final image with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring balance to forestall collapse—is signaled early and escalates as footsteps accumulate. Yet the tightening is narrated rather than dramatized; we see townsfolk return in summary, not through a decisive beat that forecloses risk. Cost is communal, not personally exacted from Thorne.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmony versus greed emerges implicitly through the ruined bells and revived cadence. Subtext whispers in Thorne’s fragments—“balance in beats”—without sermon. The final image of glowing runes offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent; patterned phrases (“wild hush,” “cryptic smiles”) create incantatory rhythm. Compression and elision are purposeful, taught early and paid off. No dialogue appears, so voice carries the entire load without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, with only minor loops (“wild hush” twice in two sentences). Metaphors stay coherent; “skeletal ruins” and “midnight wood” serve atmosphere without overwriting. One filter-verb cluster (“he would stand… he struck… he walked”) slows momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—reviving a ghost town through rhythmic walking—feels fresh, synthesizing mythic and ecological threads. Transformation of cobblestones into metronome is specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet but coherent; no gimmicks obscure clarity.</comment>
