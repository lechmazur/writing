<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her guilt and dread surface in trembling hands and prismatic shadows. The ancestral tie to the saboteur supplies a credible flaw that complicates the final choice. Yet the moment of self-reproach—“she had known the secret from old letters”—leans toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied contradiction, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the net dissolves, spirits settle, mask mends, and Elara’s confession reweights her identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each knot unraveled thickens the silence until the final release. Cost is legible in the prismatic burst that leaves her “exhaled,” purpose fulfilled but ancestral shame exposed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is no backdrop; its refracted starlight actively sharpens Elara’s unrest and amplifies the spectral voices. The tapestry needle and salt-stiff net function as micro-settings that constrain every gesture. Only the faintest excess of color-dance description keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ground the spirits—tightens with each unraveled knot; the final release forecloses Elara’s option to keep the family secret. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. The felt price is the public exposure of blood-guilt, visible in the dispersing net and settling spirits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of un-knotting silence: inherited guilt can only be laid to rest by voicing it. The betrayal’s revelation reconfigures both living and dead without moralizing. Final image of sedimented calm offers a non-literal answer—truth as ballast.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from hushed reverence to tremulous confession. Perceptual signature—“storm seen through clear glass”—is sustained. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final exhalation. One stray echo of “lucid unrest” three times edges toward loop, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional charge. Metaphors are coherent—prismatic light, interlaced hush—without purple drift. A single paraphrase loop (“accumulated silence… interlaced hush”) appears mid-story but does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of spectral net-mending with ancestral guilt feels inevitable yet fresh; no trope is left untransformed. Specificity of the rune-etched tapestry needle and salt-stiff net anchors the fantastical in tactile reality. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
