<comment>Elara’s motive is dramatized early, but the interior contradictions are voiced rather than embodied; the climactic elder’s weep feels narrated, not earned, undercutting cost perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The arc of “subtracting noise” to reach tentative harmony forms a coherent pattern; closure lands via resonance, but the before/after shift is softer than demanded at this tier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Vivid, selective sensory layers (“fogged windows”, “crimson foliage mulch”) tighten space and mood; the zither’s mother-of-pearl mandala reprises with tangible weight in the final glow.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Escalation tracks cleanly: grudges → muted overtones → elder’s voice joining; the felt price is diffuse—social credit rather than visceral, limiting upper-band intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The theme of “harmony via subtraction” emerges organically from sound to silence; no moralizing intrudes, though abstract “vanishing arts” could tie more concretely to stakes.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-limited voice sustains musical, hushed cadence that modulates with library acoustics; dialogue is sparse yet natural, and no register drift or POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical, largely loop-free; moments of “expectantly resigned” verge on cliché, but density stays high and the final hum lands without scaffolding.</comment>

<comment>Reverse-engineering peace by subtraction is fresh, and the rosette return offers earned reprise; familiar feud/reconciliation arc tempers the novelty edge slightly.</question>
