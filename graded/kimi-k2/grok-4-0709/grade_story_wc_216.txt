<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the urn fragment, the pulse she feels—but her contradictory impulses (to hoard vs. share borrowed time) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final “mended capsule” gesture is earned, yet the cost is more asserted than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the urn’s ash releases visions that reconfigure her stance toward time, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each relic and flyer adds density until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s green shadows and rusted ladder anchor space early; the urn fragment later constrains her ritual choice. Selective sensory detail (scent of aged metal, grit of ash) is woven through action rather than catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“unravel time’s mysteries before her own clock unravels”—tightens when the capsule’s damage freezes her borrowed moments, forcing a rediscovery ritual. Agency is clear; cost is visible in the ash she releases.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between measurable and felt time; the final ash-vision reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the urn’s “suspended moments” and the flyers’ coded commerce.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices “green shadows that danced like living memories.” Rhythm modulates with urgency; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally lean, but occasional stacked modifiers (“iridescent emerald that gleamed under the erratic sun”) verge on purple. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “numbers changed meaning” conceit feels fresh; embedding clues in garage-sale flyers is an inventive, grounded twist. The synthesis of ashes, urn shard, and time capsule avoids cliché.</comment>
