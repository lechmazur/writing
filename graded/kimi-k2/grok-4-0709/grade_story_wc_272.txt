<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Elias’s despair is viscerally embodied and the tarot-box compulsion is earned by prior interiority, but the “necessary darkness” motivation appears as epiphany rather than conflicted choice; final metamorphosis is asserted, not dramatized at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended box halts fracturing and Elias re-emerges transformed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—achieved by pattern intensification plus the tactile image of mended wood—but the causal why of card-tuning is left as charged poise rather than explicit linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Library/lighthouse compresses and breathes in sync with psychic fracture, guiding every descent choice; the “luminescent ache” is more than décor—it tightens oxygen and motivation. Could edge higher if the final vault’s spatial constraints were sharpened rather than generalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Stakes (“survive unraveling reality”) are signaled early and tightened once: narrowing staircase plus algae-ache fuse external and internal pressure. One clear cost—“walls closing, air thick”—is paid on the page just before redesign; agency is crystallized rather than resolved by luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—art is remade by embracing imperfection and necessary darkness—emerges through concrete arc: failed portraits → tarot entropy → rebuilt box → earned wholeness. Final rhetorical question reframes without moralizing; ambiguity is charged but legible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lush, painterly cadence stays anchored in Elias’s perceptual bias: every light is aching, every book spine weary. No register drift despite elevated diction; rhythm modulates with descent. One minor “thematic Echo” at end earns half-deduction only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, every figuration tied to pressure; “the ache deep in his bones, a glowing sorrow” epitomizes controlled synesthesia. One paraphrase loop (“luminescent ache” reused thrice in 80 words) holds score from 8.8+ level.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes cosmic fracture with portrait failure through tactile tarot-unweaving—a fresh inflection rather than trope re-hash. Risk distinction (+0.3) granted for merging mystical art-craft with literal space distortion without gimmickry.</comment>
