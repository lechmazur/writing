<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Interiority is palpable—‘fingers itch for more than mere notes’—and the embodied need to crack the ghost’s code collides with the quiet, costly renunciation Elias accepts. The single POV remains coherent, and micro-choice (bowing discord instead of melody) directly reveals a hierarchy of values under waterlogged pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s causal arc holds: find program (because storm) → damage creates image (therefore) → discord reveals code → final hush reconfigures meaning with felt cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors early; closure is Earned Stasis that forecloses bridging worlds without melodrama.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The flooded pit, floating cellos, and rippling lantern light are tactile and constrain foot placement, bow pressure, and sonic reach. The micro-setting (silted stage, ankle-deep water) actively shapes Elias’s movement and the acoustics of the final discord. No slippage; every detail earns its place in the pressure scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—unravel spectral musical passage—sharpens early; pressure rises through one decisive deepening: water and discord become the only viable probe. On-page cost is the ruined program and silent relinquishment of audience, not luck, charging closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>The unseen bridge between life and echo emerges entirely through submerged architecture, ruined pages, and the last reprise of discord—not authorial gloss. Ambiguity lingers: is the ghost vindicated or sealed away? The image of “flickering lanterns over unstruck chords” makes the thematic cost legible without moral statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyrical yet disciplined; a perceptual signature (sound as tactile, light as waveform) threads every sentence. Purposeful compression like “drowned dreams” teaches the reader to surf ellipses, paid off when the finale wordlessly resonates. No head-hop; voice modulates with sloshing urgency then post-crescendo hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence variation mirrors bowing: swelling cadences then abrupt dissonant fragments. No loops or scaffold; redundant words pruned. “Splashed across the paper” and “fixed as a final, wordless testament” contain multitudes without crowding the ear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Transforms two well-worn tropes—ghost-in-the-theatre and musician-as-seer—into an unquiet synthesis where destruction becomes encryption and silence becomes score. The conceit risks cleverness but lands via embodied stakes and irreplaceable water-born images. Bold, yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
