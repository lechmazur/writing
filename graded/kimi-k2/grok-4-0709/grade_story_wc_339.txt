<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven quest is embodied in tactile micro-choices (robotic pincers, tablet notes) and culminates in a credible renunciation; the interior contradiction between analytic detachment and emotional need is dramatized, not labeled. The final “equilibrium” is earned by the prior untangling beats and carries visible cost—he powers down the lights, letting the library fade. Minor slip: the “physics of letting go” phrase edges toward thesis-speak, but the embodied action redeems it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the snow-globe reveal reweights Elias’s entire mission, and the cost—abandoning further salvage—appears in the final ascent. Causal lens holds: each untangled thread tightens his understanding and forecloses obsession. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One hairline slip: the Morse line “letting go to the winds” is slightly too on-the-nose, nudging the score down from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abyssal library is rendered with selective sensory detail (warped shelves, bloated books) that constrains movement and frames the globe’s discovery. Micro-setting—the tilted lectern—functions as fulcrum for the pivotal choice. Atmosphere of “eerie silence” supports the theme without overwriting. Could edge higher if the pressure of depth (cracks, time) had altered tactics more explicitly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding release—is signaled early and tightens through each untangled wire; the final note forces a trade-off between knowledge and peace. Escalation is causal: each decoded layer raises the emotional cost of continued pursuit. No external reversals, but the internal deepening suffices for this length. Cost is legible in the powered-down lights and ascent without further salvage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from Elias’s embodied struggle; the snow globe’s miniature storm becomes a non-literal answer to “the physics of letting go.” Subtext is carried by gesture (loosening threads mirrors loosening grief) rather than statement. Final image of drifting free avoids moralizing. Minor deduction for the note’s explicit phrasing, but resonance remains strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—measured, marine-technical, quietly grieving. Syntax mirrors the methodical untangling: long sentences for descent, clipped fragments under pressure. No POV drift; “Mort” as addressee is consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable pull,” “clandestine device”) fits the academic widower register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“cathedral of forgotten knowledge”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“echoes teach us to drift free”—is minor and does not cloud closure. Strong paragraph cuts and prop tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of Earhart lore, espionage artifact, and grief physics feels fresh and inevitable. The snow globe as encoded last transmission is a non-obvious synthesis that reweights the entire dive. Specificity of the 1937 liner library anchors the speculative element. Risky deep-sea setting pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
