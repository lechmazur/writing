<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jack’s interior contradiction—confidence in facts vs. doubt in purpose—is embodied in the trembling hands and the decision to buy the cloth. The “confidently uncertain” label is repeated rather than dramatized, and Earl’s cameo adds no pressure, but the final micro-choice (pocketing the cloth) forecloses appraisal-as-escape with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cloth reweights Jack’s future from appraising others’ relics to curating his own. Causal chain is tight—botched TV appraisal → quarry exile → cloth discovery → pivot to museum plan—though Earl’s off-stage acquisition is a mild coincidence. Cost is legible in the phrase “promise of rediscovered rhythm.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Quarry trailer and distant excavators anchor place and mood early; the grille cloth later functions as micro-setting that constrains Jack’s choice to keep rather than sell. Sensory detail is selective (dust motes, creaky chair) but occasionally drifts into tour-guide exposition (“mid-19th century sterling”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering purpose after public failure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the cloth forces Jack to choose between appraisal detachment and personal reclamation. One clear escalation beat: the recognition of the tear pattern collapses emotional distance. Cost is the forfeiture of the lucrative sale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “after the applause” emerges organically from Jack’s shift from valuing others’ echoes to honoring his own. The final image of pocketing the cloth offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in Earl’s cluelessness underscores the fragility of legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, roadie-worn, with rhythmic control (“echo valley longing,” “starlit scars”). Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“provenance details”) momentarily drifts from POV lexicon but recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, with strong verbs and minimal scaffold. One paraphrase loop (“insulating emotionally with facts” twice in close proximity) and a mixed metaphor (“valley of what-ifs, where his purpose had been buried”) slightly dull the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar premise—lost roadie finds relic of past glory—is refreshed by the antiques-appraisal lens and the quarry’s literal echo. The grille cloth’s specific tear pattern is a fresh, irreproducible detail. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
