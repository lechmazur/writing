<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s logically emotional nature is embodied in the vibrational tuning sequence; the orb’s absolution forces him to confront his own guilt with felt cost. Interiority is specific—calloused hands, azure coat as lover’s breath—yet the final self-absolution risks a hairline slip into tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: intruders approach → Elias retreats → vibrational barrier activated → threat dissolved → self-reckoning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orb’s hum reweights Elias’s stance, cost visible in the ice-melt coat. One minor scaffold—”as the sun dipped lower” repeats twice—keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is tactile and constraining: floes crunch under boots, harmonic cracks alter tactics. Lighthouse chamber, orb, and key form a micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (frozen ghosts, molten amber) stays POV-biased; one stock phrase “frozen ghosts” nicks the ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the orb—tightens when intruders breach the dock; Elias’s agency narrows to vibrational adaptation. Cost is felt: the sonic field exposes his own guilt. Pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens; no extraneous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of absolution vs weaponization emerges through the orb’s dual nature and Elias’s self-purging. Subtext in the coat’s ice-melt and the key’s pulse avoids moralizing. Final image reweights the premise without sermon, though the concept’s metaphysics remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is textured—azure coat “whispering like a lover’s breath,” gears “creaking”—and remains stable under stress. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal,” “corporeal”) fits the lighthouse engineer’s precision but edges toward purple once.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: sentences advance action or atmosphere without loops. Metaphors are mostly controlled; “liquid flesh infused with starlight” strains slightly. High information density; only one near-duplicate phrase “fleeting golden sunset” recurs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Sonic absolution via vibrational tuning is a fresh synthesis of mystic tech and grief work. Drift-ice lighthouse setting is specific; no close genre echoes. Risk lies in the near-mythic orb, but grounded engineering detail keeps it from abstraction.</comment>
