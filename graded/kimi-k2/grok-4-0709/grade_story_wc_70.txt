<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and Thorne’s candor are sketched with vivid interiority and embodied stakes; the moment Thorne hands over the matchbox crystallizes both their motives under pressure. Yet the drone-hive collapse is reported rather than dramatized, muting the cost Elara must personally bear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout → toll → riddle → ascent → revitalization. Closure lands on-page as city lights return, carrying the conceptual cost that wonder must be actively tended. Minor drift: the “drone failure” exposition is a compressed summary rather than a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tower’s hexagonal cells, nectar dusk, and lacquer box are rendered with sensory precision and directly constrain Elara’s path. The lacquer box at apex functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore power—tightens once when Elara deciphers the riddle and again when she opens the box. Agency is hers, but the cost (risk of permanent wonder loss) is more asserted than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of wonder embedded in routine emerges organically through the tower’s living circuitry and Thorne’s involuntary honesty. Final image of lights flickering on reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“nectar dusk,” “honeyed light”—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays locked to Elara; Thorne’s dialogue carries the cadence of someone who cannot lie, creating credible voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop: “wonder leeched from the everyday miracle of light at a switch’s flick” restates the prior sentence’s idea with added gloss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Bio-engineered storm-harvesting beehive tower fused with candor-cursed toll keeper feels fresh and inevitable. The synthesis of bee lore, electricity, and emotional truth is specific to this world and voice.</comment>
