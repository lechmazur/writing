<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“the burn of the reverie”), but the story withholds any on-page choice that alters tactics; the final coordinate is given rather than seized. Motivation is clear, yet the absence of a decisive act keeps the arc just shy of earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of daily parley tightens until the final image reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the lagoon’s coordinate offered with felt cost of weeks lost. Causality holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and floating library are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Kaelen’s only avenue of action. The lagoon’s mirror surface and heat-haze figure charge the final image; the zeppelin’s brass desk anchors the present frame cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth behind Elara’s encrypted pain—is signaled early and tightens through each silent parley attempt. Escalation is textural: despair accumulates until the shift to legacy/peace message reframes options. Cost is the irreversible weeks lost, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of legacy versus struggle emerges organically from the shift in beach-debris message; no direct statement intrudes. Final image of coordinate as key offers resonant, non-literal answer about meaning surviving conflict. Subtext operates in the phantom’s single nod.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in “polished brass,” “salt sting,” and synesthetic “searing reverie.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under duress, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; psychic distance controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or pressure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is precise (“dunes rising like sleeping beasts”). Clean grammar and spatial tracking throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Retrocognitive parley via beach debris feels fresh; trope of haunted diary is transformed through silent negotiation and legacy gesture. Specificity of urchin skeleton and seaweed benediction grounds the concept. Risky structure pays off in resonant closure.</comment>
