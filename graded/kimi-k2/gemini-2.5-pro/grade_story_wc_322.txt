<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thread tension, color shift—yet the interior contradiction (seeking warmth, finding cold) is dramatized only once; the final hollowness is felt but not fully earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each memory alteration tightens the lattice until the kitchen erupts into being; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s past rewritten into cold marble—with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The gallery’s impossible geometry is not backdrop; its moiré swirl and black-glass floor mirror Elias’s inner torque and physically freeze at climax, constraining his final step toward the apparition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—map connection—escalates as each memory tweak tightens the weave; the final eruption forecloses any warmer version of his mother, exacting a visible price: his own entrapment in the gallery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of connection-as-entrapment emerges through the lattice’s transformation; the cold marble hand is a non-literal answer that reweights every prior filament without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is fever-dream precise—“sinew thread,” “bruised lavender”—with rhythmic compression under pressure; no head-hop, perceptual signature consistent, elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Sensory specificity (“ozone and salt”) advances atmosphere without clutter; final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses memory-architecture with tactile metaphysics; the “realistically imaginary” sinew and marble-skinned mother feel inevitable in hindsight, a fresh synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
