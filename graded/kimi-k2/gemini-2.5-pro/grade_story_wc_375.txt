<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s internal contradiction—“I trace the world, not reveal it”—drives every beat; the charcoal dust under nails is an embodied anchor to his shame. His mnemonist gift constrains and burdens choice in the climax, justifying the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causality is clean: each painting-guided nudge on the internal lock tightens his options until the bolt’s decisive thud lands with cost. The ruptured lock is both perpetual constraint and closure metaphor, satisfying lens and closure gate.</comment>

<comment>Sensually precise minimalism—phosphorescent pigments “drink the ambient light”—carries high information density; no ornamental loops, every line advances tension toward the unlocked future.</comment>

<comment>Using a broken lock as both prison and key is fresh; the turn from forced heist to appreciative revelation transforms a trope through character stakes and crystalline specificity.</comment>
