<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—empirical rigor vs. empathic surrender to Finch’s obsession—is embodied in the lantern-touch beat and crystallizes in his quiet refusal to flatten the report. The cost (defying Fletcher, carrying Finch’s story) is felt on the final page. Minor slip: “fortified quiet” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: lantern-induced visions → notebook discovery → reframed death → deliberate report revision. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias forecloses the easy sign-off; the price is professional risk. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tunnel’s wet-earth reek and iron chill constrain oxygen and footing, directly enabling the fatal slip; the lantern’s tactile corrosion charges the final image as both promise and cage. Selective sensory triage mirrors Elias’s forensic gaze. Micro-setting (body, lantern) functions as setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. convenience—tightens when the notebook forces Elias to choose integrity over expediency. The lantern’s psychic pressure escalates stakes under causal logic; cost is the career friction he accepts in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of inherited moral obligation emerges through the lantern’s transference of memory; no explicit moralizing. The closing image of the lantern as “cage” reweights freedom vs. fixation without statement. Subtext in Elias’s silent refusal carries the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clinical diction (“preventable death investigator,” “empirical observation”) modulates to sensory immediacy under lantern’s spell. Rhythm tightens in sync with reverberations. No POV leakage; free indirect style cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“fortified quiet”) slightly jars but does not obscure. Sensory specificity (“wet earth and cold iron”) propels rather than stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: forensic ghost story where historical artifact transmits memory to modern bureaucrat, forcing ethical stance. Risky psychic-transfer device is grounded in tactile detail and paid off in closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
