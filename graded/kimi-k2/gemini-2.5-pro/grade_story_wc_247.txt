<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his ritualistic movements and invented sign-language reveal a singular, obsessive mind. The memory of Lyra functions as a contradictory impulse, urging him “deeper” while he simultaneously grieves her absence. His final renunciation—leaving the now-singing harbor—carries visible emotional cost. Only the “quietly charismatic” label remains ornamental, never constraining choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence becomes an unending song, reweighting the entire premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mapped silence thickens the texture until the final chord releases it. Causality is implied but not forced; the payoff is the felt shift in atmosphere. Cost is legible in Elian’s solitary walk away, bearing both sorrow and joy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is not backdrop but instrument: moonlit water, rotted pylons, and the “hole in the world” ferry landing actively shape Elian’s choices. The camera’s cool leather and the aggressive blackness beneath the pier constrain his final gesture. Spatial choreography is precise; each new vantage is discovered through goal-directed movement. The setting charges the final image—the harbor now “entirely changed.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled early and escalates through denser, riskier mappings. The final disruption is a single decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens: the silence becomes unbearably “active,” forcing Elian’s most complex composition. Cost is the irreversible exposure of forgotten grief; no coincidence resolves it. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s persistence versus oblivion’s pull. Subtext lives in gesture—signing the void is both communion and confrontation. The ending’s “quiet, unending song” offers a non-literal answer: the dead remain lost, yet are never again silent. No moral is stated; the melancholic beauty invites reflection without prescription.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the rising tide of silence. Sensory detail is filtered through Elian’s obsession: moonlight “turning the placid water into a rippling sheet of silver.” Lyra’s whisper is handled as internal echo, not dialogue, maintaining POV integrity. No head-hopping or register drift; the prose stays within the lexicon of a solitary artist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and texture, accelerating during the final “desperate, beautiful ballet.” Figurative language is sparse but purposeful—no mixed metaphors or purple stacks. Information density is high: each click and sign advances both atmosphere and plot. Zero loops or scaffold; every paragraph earns its keep.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—mapping silence with a filmless camera and invented sign-language—is fresh and fully committed to. Tropes of the haunted artist and ghostly harbor are transformed through tactile ritual and embodied grief. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of the ferry landing as “a hole in the world” anchors universality in place.</comment>
