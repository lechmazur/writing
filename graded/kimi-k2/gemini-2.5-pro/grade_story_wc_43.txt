<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s serene kindness is embodied through micro-choices—brewing the right tea, modulating room sounds—yet her decisively kind force never encounters credible pushback; she appears more vessel than person. The father–daughter reconciliation is credible, but Elara’s interior stake (“flawless goodbye”) feels static, her contradictory impulses muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: causal linkage relies on ritual buildup rather than turns. Closure lands with unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration—final hand-hold under fading “Stardust”. Cost is the shared tear tracing hair; no options remain undone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Glass walls, gravity-spun blanket, perpetual cloud sea are vivid and selective. The Eyrie subtly constrains choice—transport and privacy are dictated by altitude and oxygen—but the body-as-micro-setting (Mr. Aris’s roadmap hand) more powerfully charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: repair fractured love before death. Escalation occurs through ritual density—the reprise of the intact record in the room’s charged stillness forecloses all other actions. Agency is Elara’s but remains secondary; the protagonists’ silence carries greater felt tension than her own decisions, muting cost visibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reunification through shared sensory memory arises organically; the hymn to mundanity (tea-steam, monitor beep) reweighted by death carries quiet resonance. No meta commentary, no overt moral—only the final chord that reframes broken vinyl as a key rather than a wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person close stays locked on Elara; free-indirect drift into Lena kept at bay. Micro-level perceptual signature—“gravity-spun blanket”, “oxygen-rich”—reflects her musical attentiveness rather than generic calm. Dialogue is sparse and subtext-laden; Elara’s single spoken threat (“His time…”) maintains her decisive kindness while sounding like someone who has sung goodbye many times.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic line-level control; some modifier stacks (“radiant haven above the clouds”) risk prettifying without added pressure. No loops or synonym churn, yet a few metaphors—“pulse of stillness”—straddle cliché. Precision returns in tactile details: needle crackle, steam-scent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle: hospice above the clouds, music therapy as architecture of farewell, vinyl shard reborn as key. Premise avoids generic end-of-life narrative through sensory hymning. Still recognizable as uplift-lit; risk feels moderate, transformation evident but not radically original.</comment>
