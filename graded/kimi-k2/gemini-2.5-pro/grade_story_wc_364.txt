<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is embodied and specific—“calloused but careful,” “captured twilight”—and his bartered memories carry a palpable cost. The contradiction between gentle hands and brutal trade is dramatized in the final gesture, not summarized. One slip: the phrase “state caught precisely between understanding and confusion” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the momentary tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arch’s blue lattice reweights the premise and the personal cost is felt in Elian’s hollowing. Causal linkage holds—each descent and offering tightens the stake under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating arches, dust-sour orchards, and geothermal cavern are filtered through Elian’s tactile priorities; the geode-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis: taste of plum, scent of stone. One arch’s new blue trace in the final image directly charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each descent and memory-forfeit. The single meaningful turn (offering the plum memory) narrows options and exacts a visible price. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-loss emerges from concrete particulars: the silk as second skin, the traded taste of fruit. Final image of the blue-veined arch offers a non-literal answer—renewal bought by self-emptying—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no thematic echo in the closing line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elian’s perceptual signature—“quietly determined spirit,” “hollowed out”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during the barter beat. Diction remains within the blacksmith’s plausible lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“petrified bones of forgotten gods”—and never clutters the climax. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the final image is crystalline and uncluttered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of geode-healing via traded sensory memory feels inevitable yet non-obvious; the silk conduit transforms from glamorous leftover to surgical graft. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes; the orchard-planet premise is grounded in lived detail.</comment>
