<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is precise and embodied—his noticing of Elara’s micro-gesture shift is character-specific. The contradiction between love and curatorial detachment drives every beat. The final integration choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Only the “sole curator” label feels slightly generic, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s light-vines shift to silvery-blue, reweighting hope. Causal linkage holds—each beat flows from Kael’s noticing to integration. Cost is legible in the warmed stone and luminous regret. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Lumina-Arbor is sketched with selective, sensory strokes; the console of pearl and cloud-sea outside anchor space. The river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Setting never stalls momentum. Slight over-reliance on visual keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve Elara’s wholeness—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Kael discovers the shadow’s origin in the shared dream. Integration forecloses deletion as an option; cost is the permanent sorrow he must carry. One meaningful escalation suffices under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of embracing darkness to preserve light emerges organically from Kael’s choice. Subtext lives in the shift from “perfect mask” to “fragile, real” smile. Final image of dawn tinged with frost offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature is Kael’s curator’s precision. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure—long sentences for reflection, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping or register drift. Distinct without showiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful (“poisonous vine strangling a perfect rose”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral light-vines”) stays within Kael’s scholarly lexicon. One mixed metaphor—“cage she had built around herself from within”—slightly muddies, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of memory-garden above clouds is fresh; the “shadow unbound” as calcified trauma is non-obvious. Integration sequence feels inevitable yet surprising. Specificity of gesture comparison and river-stone conduit transforms familiar grief arc. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
