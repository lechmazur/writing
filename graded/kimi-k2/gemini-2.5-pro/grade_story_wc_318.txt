<comment>Mourning ghost-mentor’s contradictory impulses—yearning vs. spectral limitation—drive every choice; embodied sorrow steers the final “macerate” beat to shred accumulated grief with leaf-blower wind and lullaby melody. Cost arrives as the wife’s half-smile, proving the haunting succeeded at the price of admitting his own absence. Flaw retained and paid: he remains dead, voice only noise, love only memory.</comment>

<comment>Closure is earned Resonant Reconfiguration: ghost’s three pulls→engine roar→melody→tear/smile tightens stakes from silence to “start of laughter.” Because/therefore chain clear throughout; each escalation flows from prior ghost action. Cost on page: wife’s tear + smile = explicit price for haunting.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dusty garage shadows, brittle leaves on tile, hallway as acoustic amplifier: micro-settings and objects constrain ghost’s tactics—the channel demands roar and echo. “Echo chamber tunnel” returns in the final beat to charge the wife’s recognition, grounding the miracle inside ordinary architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—revive laughter—signalled early, pressure tightens once with machine roar that forces family confrontation. One clear turn: silence → chaotic roar → tentative tear/smile; cost manifest as wife’s face change. Sufficient single escalation for word count.</comment>

<grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Theme emerges: grief can be shredded not banished, love persists as embodied noise. Subtext conveyed via melody inside engine, tear that is half-smile. No moralizing; ambiguity of “start, not laughter” lingers appropriately.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Narrative voice is spectral present-tense, selective sensory detail, consistent POV locked inside ghost. Diction haunted and exact (“shadowed corners,” “cold two-stroke”). Syntax modulates with intensity—short bursts, lyrical pulls—mirroring ghostly yearning. Zero head-hop.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Kinetic sentences with varied length avoid loops; strong verbs (“whipped,” “macerate,” “shredded”) propel line-level energy. Occasional elevated lyric (“brittle, brown leaves”) fits elevated ghost narrator. No clutter, no paraphrase loops, one minor filter-verb stack (“heard it then”) does not dull image in closure zone.</question>

<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: leaf-blower as requiem orchestra, haunting as tender audio intervention. Transformative rather than gimmick; familiar elegy reframed. Specific small details (handle, lullaby under drone) make trope irreplaceable. Closure cannot function with any other noise or machine.</question>
