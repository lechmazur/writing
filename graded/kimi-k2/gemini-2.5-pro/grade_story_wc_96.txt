<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid ("Architect vs Reckoner") and contradictions surface momentarily, but Elara functions more as mirror than crucible; silence, poems, and tentative drifters crystallize a communal stance, yet Silas’s personal stakes flatten after the false-bottom tin reveal, leaving the cost communal, not private.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens shifts from Accumulative/Textural to gentle Situational, where the arrival of drifters serves as tightening rather than plot turn; closure lands in a Charged Poise as four silhouettes sort—community forming with undeniable conceptual cost. Motivation holds, but the absence of a prior antagonistic pressure or decisive sacrifice caps the ceiling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<splendid><comment>The rusted library dome beneath cold stars functions not as postcard ruins but as resource, constraint, and mirror: every book spine and shifting moonlight determines movement and visibility. Silas’s intimate choreography—kneeling, twisting tin, folding poems within the echoing shell—grounds the scene and charges the closing tableau.</comment></question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—beauty from decay—is articulated early and tightens when two silhouettes appear. The pressure remains situational, communal, low-threat; the absence of explicit antagonism prevents deeper escalation, yet the shared cost of continued sorting carries enough weight to narrow future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resurrection through text, silence, and small acts ripples subtextually from first moon sliver to final whispered poem. The refrain never moralizes; instead, the image of rust and starlight re-prices what salvaging is worth. The ending answers the question without naming it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<luminous><comment>The lyrical diction (“sliver of bone,” “cathedral of decay”) aligns elegantly with the moon-bathed ruins and vagrant poet lens; rhythmic control is crisp, only minor filter-verbs peeking late. Voice convergence between Silas and Elara stays intentional under shared hush.</comment></question>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet evocative, with high information density in every clause (“grimy marble floor,” “water-warped spines”); metaphor threads are coherent rather than stacked. Minor template drift in two adjacent line openings (“he knelt,” “he twisted”) but momentum remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>The ruined library re-functioned as seedbed for micro-revolutions is a fresh pivot on familiar post-collapse tropes. Integration is organic—no symbolic grab-bags or genre trick, only the lived specificity of folded poems in a dented tin, making beauty inevitable out of decay.</question>
