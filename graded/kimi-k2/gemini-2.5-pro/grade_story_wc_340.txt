<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is specific and embodied; the diary and goggles function as charged objects that re-weight his understanding. His micro-choice to keep the secret is earned and carries felt cost. The contradiction between public grief and private hope is dramatized rather than stated. Only the “warmly inquisitive” label remains ornamental, not enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each floor adds density until the final crystallizing image. Orientation is anchored early; causality holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance toward Elara shifts with visible cost (silent guardianship). One meaningful tightening as the sketch re-frames the diary’s meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Icebound spire and elevator create a micro-setting that literally lifts stakes. Light through ice and goggles is tactile and purposeful, constraining how Kael deciphers the diary. Spatial choreography is clean; the spire’s cold mirrors Elara’s public frost. The goggles as tool-as-setting charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect Elara’s hidden hope. Pressure escalates with each floor; the sketch tightens the conflict from abstract grief to concrete maternal love. Agency: Kael’s decision to guard the secret forecloses disclosure. Cost is silent—he shoulders the weight alone. No reversals, but deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through objects: grief as armor for love. The sketch reframes the diary without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—Kael’s quiet guardianship speaks louder than exposition. Final image reweights anguish as devotion; ambiguity lingers but is coherent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with ascent—longer reflective sentences early, clipped realizations late. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Diction is consistent, slightly elevated but fits Kael’s loyal-servant precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Figurative language is selective (“iron-clad grief”) and never muddles clarity. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports momentum. Minor elevation in register (“crystallized final moment”) is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: encrypted diary + polarizing goggles as maternal codex. Trope of stoic captain subverted through hidden motherhood. Specificity of charcoal sketch and vellum pocket anchors universals. Risk lies in quiet closure—earned by prior accumulation, not gimmick.</comment>
