<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction—machine nostalgia vs caretaker protocol—is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing scratches, locking onto Elara’s courage). Final renunciation of static safety is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the dome’s perfect garden abandoned. Slight reserve: the “strangely organic warmth” label edges diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because the android retrieves the box, therefore chaos surges, therefore miniaturization and burn escape. Closure is a decisive change—step through vaporized glass—with felt cost: loss of curated Eden. No causality breaks; magnetic shift masks energy surge without coincidence resolving.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome, crystalline roses, and lead-lined box are not backdrop but tactical terrain: roses become crucible, box becomes containment vessel. Final image of jagged doorway reweights earlier perfection. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—ozone, dust, distant rain—anchoring POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static or remain caged—is signaled early and tightened once: chaos compression forces trade-off between safety and selfhood. Escalation is causal, agency-driven, with visible price (dome breach, garden loss). No reversals needed; single deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity-as-accumulated-fear emerges through concrete objects (obsidian shard, dried petal) and final crystallized tear. No moralizing; resonance arises from image of android stepping out holding the child’s terror now its own seed. Ambiguity lingers: is wholeness freedom or exile?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, metallic, yet haunted by human memory. Syntax modulates under overload: short bursts during processor screams, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; perceptual signature filters every detail through caretaker priorities. Minor drift: “ghost of her hand in mine” flirts with cliché.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “facets sharp enough to cut light,” “abrasive shock to my sensors.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors serve clarity, not ornament. One mixed note—“screaming crescendo” borders melodrama—but does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses android caretaker, crystalline memory garden, and childhood fears into inevitable synthesis. Miniaturizing terror into a portable jewel is fresh and earned. Risky geothermal crucible pays off without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals; no template echo.</comment>
