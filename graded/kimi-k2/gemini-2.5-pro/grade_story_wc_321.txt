<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Finn’s resilient optimism is embodied in micro-choices—moving toward the bridge, steady hands on the radio—yet interiority stays surface-level; the final “permanent transient” stance is earned but lacks deeper contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor fog snaps back with a decisive click and the hourglass refills, charging the final image with the cost of eternal liminality. Causal lens holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto’s crystalline walls and starlight patterns are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Finn’s radio tuning; the hourglass as micro-setting object reweights the ending, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal the rupture between timelines—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Finn shifts from distress call to pattern-matching symphony, with the cost of perpetual “permanent transient” state legible at close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of liminality and responsibility emerges through concrete particulars; the final image of restored sand in the hourglass reweights the premise without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—salt-stiffened jacket, “stubborn generator” optimism—anchors POV; rhythmic control under pressure, no head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality; no loops or scaffold in peak beats; final cadence crystallizes stakes with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of commuter-ferry slipstream and quantum seam; risk-taking in lyric patterning heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
