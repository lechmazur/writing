<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is specific—“quiet wildfire” registers the grief-driven obsession without diagnostic therapy-speak. The thumb-polished laser pointer shows tactile fixation, and releasing the button costs him the last visceral hold on “her shape.” Contradictory pull between security instinct and desire to open permeable exit is dramatized rather than stated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the field reseals, love is relinquished not retrieved, and cost (loss, exhaustion, literal field integrity) is legible in final cadence. Drive lens held: each beat follows “because he senses field strain therefore he tunes” until final release; no unmotivated turns or convenient resets. Orientation anchored in first paragraph; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mushroom farm isn’t scenic wallpaper—Fae Caps themselves generate the dimensional friction barrier Kael must momentarily unwork. The air tasting “damp earth and ozone” primes biotech tone; glow pulses like slow heartbeat, becoming the on-page light Kael thins to transparency. Spatial choreography between cavern width and fingertip device stays coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake: learn the physics of letting go. Tightening occurs when Kael realizes the distortions aren’t enemies to repel but people needing egress; choice to weaken the perimeter, not strengthen it, directly forecloses forever keeping her “familiar” form within reach. Cost legible—field reseals with her irretrievable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: intrusion detection refigured as permeable compassion; “revolutionize security” reframed from keep out to release. Final smile of receding figure offers resonant non-verbal gloss on grief mechanics—no moralizing. Subtext of permeability and loss coils through cavern’s containment biology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Distilled, sensor-nervy voice—world perceived as “lattice of forces.” Syntax tightens under tension, no head-hop. Biotechnical lexicon stays within focalizer’s likely competence. Final “profound exhaustion” carried through cadence of slowed heartbeat imagery; tone modulates with closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Sensory economy—every line does work: “ghostly blue-green” anchors light while advancing barrier properties. No loops or filler metaphors. Rhythm varies with scene pressure: longer sentences during sensor sweep, clipped pulses at click. Closure line’s quiet stillness lands without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Bold premise: grief retooled into soft-skill security R&D; intrusion specialist transforms into exit facilitator. Laser pointer rebirthed as metaphysical key feels inevitable by closing beat. Specificity of “Faecaps” biotech permeability prevents transplant into generic SF. Emotional truth (physics of letting go) stays universal exactly because anchored in unique particulars.</comment>
