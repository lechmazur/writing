<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with the ghost-composer is embodied in tactile micro-choices—tilting the program, lowering it to the water—each revealing a hierarchy of values (music over preservation). The final renunciation—destroying the artifact to birth the song—carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by his earlier reverence. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “strange creative fever” edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the ruined program becomes the completed coda, reweighting ruin into legacy. Causal chain holds—because Elias disrupts the water, therefore the ink blooms into music—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image of the sodden, now-silent page. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is no backdrop; the stagnant water is the medium that both destroyed and preserves the score, directly enabling the climax. Lantern-light on glassy blackness mirrors Elias’s suspended state, then reframes it when the water rewrites the program. Micro-setting—the lip of the pit—constrains his reach and frames the decisive dip. One minor over-description: “dark mirror” + “stagnant lake” is redundant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s message—tightens when passive study fails and Elias risks destroying the only clue. The single meaningful turn (disrupt the surface) escalates under Accumulative pressure: each capillary inch raises the cost of irreversible loss. Stakes remain visceral because the artifact is literally dissolving. No secondary reversal needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: art outlives ruin only through sacrificial transformation. The water that erased the opera now completes the composer’s final phrase, reweighting destruction as continuity. No moralizing; the ending’s resonant quiet invites reflection on legacy and loss. The program’s journey from relic to score embodies the theme without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the hush and surge of water. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices tide-stains, velvet damp, ink bloom—never touristic catalog. No POV leakage; interior monologue stays cello-player specific. One near-slip: “unshed tear” flirts with cliché but is saved by context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“wraiths,” “skeletal ribs”—and never clutters the climax. No loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s cadence slows to match solemnity. Minor filter verb (“he felt the presence”) is the lone blemish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—ghost communicates via water-damaged program—feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing gothic ruin with tactile conservation science. Risky choice to let the climax hinge on capillary action pays off because the physics is dramatized, not explained. Transformation test: story collapses without the exact flooded opera house and antique paper. No derivative echoes.</comment>
