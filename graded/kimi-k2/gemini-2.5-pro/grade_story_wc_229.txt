<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodiment run deep—his “screaming tenderness” is palpable in micro-choice (pressing the vial, risking Hemlock’s wrath). Causality holds: his belief in quiet guiding costs him physical effort and social exposure. The final reticence is earned withheld emotion rather than tidy epiphany. Slight label-slip “raw need” keeps it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A tight causal arc under the Causal lens: “held breath” → foghorn’s exhaustion → Elias’s whisper-charge → freighter glides. Closure landings on the page—“Elias said nothing”—carry undeniable cost of secrecy and proven paradigm. Lens clear and never breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Predawn palette, salt air “like a held breath,” lantern-room glass pressing into skin—every sensory beat doubles as constraint (lens, vial, shoal). The vial cork’s scent re-enters the final image as invisible pathfinder; environment is active agent, not backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Single dominant—save the Stellaria—tightens steadily as Hemlock’s blast fails and Elias’s quiet alternative gains traction. Cost arrives on deck when the captain smells “my wife’s garden,” acknowledging an intimate trade Elias will never admit. One compression turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arrives as lived experience: noise vs. whisper actualized in competing siren calls. The garden scent reframed from childhood safety into adult tool quietly argues that gentleness can pierce crisis—no narrator sermonizing, only the freighter’s bell as resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Luminous, tactile lyricism under coherent 3rd-limited, never drifting. Distinct perceptual signature: “predawn bruise,” “gentle scream,” etc. Syntax breathes with urgency, slows into crystalline last image. No POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, clean rhythm; concrete nouns carry weather and light. Only minuscule overwriter “screaming tenderness” in peak beat, quickly forgiven. Sentence propulsion matches pulse of risk.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fog rescue is familiar, yet transformed by scent-as-cord, lighthouse lens as empathy filter—particulars feel inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echo, risk taken on overt magic realism without hand-waving.</comment>
