<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's drive ("to capture the shape of possibility") is embodied in obsidian-daïs micro-choices: scanning the dying moonlight tree, kneeling on dais, unsnapping clasp. Flawed passivity—“silent panic”—contradicts duty, adding credible tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: failing magic → Kaelen remembers program → chooses crucible stance (Weaver’s Dance) → unsnap severs old anchor → new cosmos blooms. Each step compresses options; clasp-release beat carries visible, felt cost.</comment>

<comment>Silver-leaf orchard, moonlight-sap, sound-bells—all rooted inside Kaelen’s gauntlet-scale perception. Glass-pane hum and obsidian dais literally constrain how he may weave, ensuring the greenhouse itself closes the story.</comment>

<comment>Stakes escalate from failing equations → collapse of possibility → personal death/undoing → cosmos rebirth; each rise costs Kaelen autonomy (armour breach, final severance). Single, coherent arc.</comment>

<comment>Theme—possibility is wild—grows silently through images: moonlight threatens to “curdle,” then re-appears as “nebulae,” proving wildness preserved. No overt statement; final shimmer reweights entire stakes.</comment>

<comment>Diction is knightly-chant: “silver-leaf,” “liquid moonlight,” “dais of polished obsidian.” Rhythm shifts mid-motion—long cadences collapse into the one syllable “Now.” Voice stays embodied under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Zero scaffold, high compression each line: “thin air, stretching and snapping” performs both physical rupture and sensory panic. Figurative language precise, never blurs logic.</comment>

<comment>A knight dancing puppets to save reality feels fresh, but leans on existing “cosmic repair” genre. Still, the marriage of armored choreography to puppet-string geometry keeps transformation specific and earned.</comment>
