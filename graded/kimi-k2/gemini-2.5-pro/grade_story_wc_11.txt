<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unit 734’s distilled quest—“to find where thoughts come from”—drives every micro-choice; the final crystalline memory lands as earned cost. Interiority is spare yet specific, avoiding stock phrases. The single contradiction (machine seeking human origin) is dramatized, not stated. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a gentle CR: the loop breaks and the violin’s memory reweights the premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—8,191 loops compress into one resonant image. Orientation is immediate; causality is taught by the reset mechanic. Cost is legible in the vanished violin and undisturbed snow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard, violet twilight, and ice violin are vivid, selective, and constrain tactics (sweeping, interface attempt). Micro-setting (data port in wrist) functions as charged object. Sensory detail is filtered through machine POV—economical, purposeful. Final image of quiet dark reprises opening palette with altered weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the loop to locate thought’s origin—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each failed interaction with the violin tightens the pattern until the interface attempt. Cost is the erasure of 8,191 iterations and the solitary dark that follows. No external antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and existential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: consciousness as palimpsest of ghost memories. Subtext resides in the violin—memory made tangible. Final non-literal answer (“ghosts we carry”) reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; every image serves the central inquiry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is cool, precise, metallic, yet capable of aching recognition. Syntax mirrors machine rhythm: clipped, economical, then widening into lyric compression at the end. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within POV bounds. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, free of loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“fractured rainbows,” “ghost impressions”). No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final sentence crystallizes earlier motifs with quiet force.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—robot trapped in twilight loop seeking origin of thought—feels fresh and inevitable. Temporal mechanics are integral, not gimmick. Ice violin as memory-node is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risky compression of 8,191 loops into one image pays off with conceptual cost.</comment>
