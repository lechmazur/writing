<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s quiet, embodied curiosity (“potter’s intuition”) and the micro-choice to water the rose anchor interiority; the final act of rebuilding the channel crystallizes his arc with visible cost (clay under nails, nightfall). No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the oasis’s gentle past is momentarily re-embodied through Kaelen’s act, and the thrum’s subsidence marks a felt cost—his own labor and night spent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each kindness thickens the “tapestry” until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lantern glass, rose, and clay channel function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image; the hexagonal shadows and skeletal apricots root us in place without catalog bloat. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“scorched, cracked skin”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some places resist change—is signaled early and tightened when Kaelen’s single act of repair re-animates the oasis’s memory; the cost is the night’s labor and the irreversible passage of his own time. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: gentleness as tensile strength. The final image of “profound silence… of peace” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—watering a dying rose, smoothing clay—never in assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, potter-specific (“clay having a memory of the wheel”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for reflection, clipped fragments during the thrum’s swell. No head-hop; focalization stays locked to Kaelen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image does double duty (“sun bled out,” “chimney smoke flattens”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Density is high without purple overload; the final sentence lands clean and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The phototropic-oasis conceit feels inevitable in hindsight; kindness as literal photosynthetic force is fresh, never gimmicky. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
