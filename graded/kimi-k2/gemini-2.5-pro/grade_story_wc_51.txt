<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is rich and embodied—his thumb on the brass knob, the ache of the farmer’s grief—but the final placement of the stone is a ritual repetition rather than a choice that costs him a live option; the arc is accumulative, not decisively altered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the farmer’s grief calcifies into a tear-shaped stone, the mosaic deepens, and the hush grows heavier. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each burden adds mass without causal reversal, and the cost is the ever-thickening silence Kaelen must endure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight, and burner form a micro-setting that constrains every motion; the star’s axis literally forges the stone. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, anchoring reader orientation within 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kaelen’s solitary task of transmuting sorrow—tightens once when the new grief arrives and calcifies. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the cumulative weight of silence he must bear, visible in the expanding mosaic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: grief given form becomes bearable silence. The tear-shaped stone and deepening hush reweight the premise without moralizing; the final image of Kaelen kneeling in heavier stillness offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”—with rhythmic control that mirrors Kaelen’s slow, deliberate movements. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the crystalline final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers silence or sorrow. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and coherent, never muddling the calcification beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The fractal weaver who transmutes grief into stones via starlight is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Specificity of the burner, grotto, and mosaic prevents abstraction; the concept commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
