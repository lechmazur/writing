<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his weathered hand on the vine, the pouch ritual—but the manager remains a cipher; her 98-luck score is told, not embodied. The marble-crack motif crystallizes his value hierarchy and earns the final cracked sphere, yet the “wisely pragmatic” trait is asserted more than tested in scene. Still, the contradiction between low luck and living mastery drives every beat, and the cost of tenure loss is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the butterflies’ choice reweights the premise that data trumps intuition, and Elias’s deliberate crack of the pristine marble shows felt cost. Causal linkage holds—each polishing beat foreshadows the final gesture—though the butterfly arrival is lightly situational rather than strictly causal. Orientation is swift; no drift in time or space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The garden is rendered through Elias’s hands and nose, not catalogued; the sundial and mossy marble niche act as micro-settings that constrain where he can place tokens. Sensory hierarchy is tight—rot, scent of roses, hum of bees—anchoring stakes in lived texture. The maze itself shapes the final test path, but the automated sector is sketched more generically, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove gardens choose gardeners—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the solstice deadline. Escalation is one steady rise: each marble placed marks a micro-victory that accumulates to the butterfly verdict. Cost is visible in the cracked marble and the looming job loss. No false reversals; coincidence complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between quantified luck and unmeasurable care; no character states it outright. The cracked marble reprises the earlier “mended deception,” reframing imperfection as proof of life. Subtext in the manager’s tightening smile carries more weight than her dialogue. Final image offers a non-literal answer: beauty chooses its custodian, not the algorithm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is gnarled, patient, tactile—“a web of fine fractures” rather than “cracks.” Syntax slows for reverence, tightens under judgment. POV stays locked to Elias; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is sparse but distinct when it appears; the manager’s clipped diction contrasts with Elias’s unspoken monologue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “blooming, withering grace” compresses triumph and elegy in four words. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are organic—“river of living jewels”—and never mixed. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the butterfly surge, then settling into the final polishing cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The measurable-luck premise is fresh, yet the story’s heart is an ancient one: caretaking versus optimization. Transformation is complete—swap any detail and the emotional arc collapses. Risk lies in the quiet ending that trusts image over spectacle; it pays off. No derivative echoes; the marble ritual feels invented, not borrowed.</comment>
