<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—methodical mapping vs. raw grief—are embodied in tactile micro-choices (finger on map, accordion sigh). The final renunciation of the accordion earns its cost through prior causality, though the interiority flirts with therapy-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the graffiti reframes the map quest, the accordion is left, and the river’s indifference becomes a new orientation. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the single wheezing note crystallizes cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station and taped accordion function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean. Environment subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightened when graffiti forces Elias to redraw the “lines.” The accordion’s final abandonment carries visible cost. Escalation is one deepening beat, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between map and territory; the graffiti’s wisdom is earned, not preached. Final image of flowing alongside the river offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Complexity is embraced; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-consistent; perceptual signature is distinct (“sandpaper against his nerves”). Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge the motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-quest is transformed through the accordion’s wheeze and the graffiti’s inversion of cartography. Specificity of patched bellows and ivy-choked station creates freshness. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
