<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied; the cicada, snail, and starlight all refract her stance. The final renunciation is earned by the reflective sequence that reweights loss into transition. One minor slip: “patient transition toward a few glorious weeks” edges toward summary rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images (cicada, snail, starlight) tightens until the final line reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s calm statement crystallizes the new stance with felt cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, moss, starlight, and the cicada in hand form a micro-setting that constrains the final choice: the threshold space itself becomes the metaphoric shell that must crack. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to respond to Kael’s departure—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through Elara’s tangential observation until the final crystallization forecloses protest or pleading. Cost is the ache beneath her calm, legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges from concrete particulars (cicada, snail, starlight) without moralizing. Final line offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting: “time changes its song.” No thematic drift or late exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual signature—tidal-pool chronicler’s habit of sidelong attention. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (cicada wings “veined like fossilized leaves” returns in the flight image). No loops or scaffold; one near-mixed metaphor (“unshed rain” vs “settled pool”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar heartbreak scene is refreshed through the tidal-pool chronicler’s lens and the cicada’s life-cycle conceit. Specificity of observation and the final reconfiguration feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
