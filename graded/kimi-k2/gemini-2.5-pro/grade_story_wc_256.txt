<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the shift from “hearing” to “seeing” sound is dramatized through tactile micro-choices. The final renunciation—accepting silence as light—carries visible cost in the glowing bell. Minor: the “powerfully gentle” trait is asserted more than tested until the final adjustment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lost frequency is redefined from audible to visible, reweighting the premise. Causal chain (lens → hologram → resonance) is tight; cost is the lifelong quest re-cast as wordless light. Lens ambiguity never arises; drive is Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory’s “golden shadows” and ozone scent are selective and POV-filtered. The carbide lens and crystal bells function as micro-settings that constrain tactics; the final golden glow emerges from these specific objects. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightened once: the bell must resonate with light, not sound. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; the cost is the irreversible shift from sonic to luminous communion. No external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection-as-visible-pattern emerges organically from the holographic lattice. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the scratched lens—“history of deep, dark places”—quietly charges the ending light with buried labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision fused with reverent awe. Syntax modulates from long, breath-held sentences to clipped procedural steps. No dialogue; internal voice remains coherent and textured.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful (“cascades of faint, colored light”). No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift—“resonance matrix”—is brief and context-anchored.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise reframes synesthesia as engineering: sound made visible to restore connection. The miner's lens repurposed as optical translator is a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking (silent final “note”) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
