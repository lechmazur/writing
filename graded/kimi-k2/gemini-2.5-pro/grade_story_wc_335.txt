<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—mentoring Elara while retreating from his own failure—are embodied in his backward shuffle and trembling hands. Elara’s micro-choice to restack scrolls crystallizes her earned resilience. The mentor-student crucible shifts status: she becomes the caretaker, he the one exposed. Only the “reversible exile” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping this just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara renounces immediate escape to rebuild with Kael, cost visible in her kneeling to restack scrolls. Causal lens holds—each backward step and tea-leaf reading tightens the stakes until the final refusal. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. One hairline slip: the phrase “reversible exile” is expositional rather than earned in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library is not backdrop; its dust, precarious scrolls, and crystalline cube constrain every move. The cube’s trapped shadow literalizes the cost of premature return, charging the final image. Micro-setting—the slate of tea leaves—functions as map and mirror. Only the playground swing remains atmospheric rather than instrumental, capping this below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s readiness to return—tightens when Kael’s reading reveals the memory she must surrender. Escalation is causal: each annotation raises the price of failure. The final renunciation forecloses the immediate path with visible cost (kneeling, restacking). No external coincidence dilutes pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through concrete particulars: knots, scars, fallen scrolls. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s backward steps say more than his warnings. Final image of Elara rebuilding quietly reframes exile as apprenticeship rather than punishment. No moralizing; the silence after “no longer my concern” carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is spare, chisel-sharp, matching Kael’s diction; Elara’s softer cadence surfaces in her single spoken line. Free indirect style stays clean, no head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for Kael’s instructions, clipped fragments under stress. Only minor filter slips (“she felt”) keep this from 9.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “skin was a tapestry of fine, silvery scars,” “shadow caught in glass.” No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and consistent. One mixed metaphor—“quiet roar of his belief”—is minor and does not cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The shard-mirror archivist, tea-leaf cartography, and trapped shadow synthesize into a fresh mythos of exile-as-archive. Tropes of mentor and prodigy are inverted when the student chooses to stay. Specificity—scars, jasmine dregs, backward steps—grounds the fantastical. Risky compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
