<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—transient art vs. permanent community—is embodied in the reed-bird dropped and the obsidian polishing cloth accepted. Micro-choices (pointing to the fissure, weaving root-mats) visibly trade solitude for belonging. The final beat earns the shift with felt cost: his art becomes caretaking, not self-expression. Only slight reserve: Lyra remains more catalyst than crucible, limiting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (reed, arbor, vine-tag) thickens until the final image reweights Kaelen’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise—he stands between reeds and obsidian, belonging now glowing but not erased. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of pure artistic solitude. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Crystalline orchard and crater light are filtered through Kaelen’s artisan eye, constraining where he searches and what he later protects. The obsidian arbor evolves from alien monument to object he is invited to tend, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (phosphorescent vine, damp moss) anchors without cataloging. Micro-setting (reed mats at sapling roots) directly shapes the closing gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Kaelen graft himself into the community?—tightens once when the vine-tag discovery converts communal myth into shared labor. His agency drives every beat: choosing the overlooked fissure, weaving mats overnight, accepting the cloth. Cost is the quiet surrender of solitary art. No reversals, but one decisive deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of belonging emerges through the reeds-to-obsidian arc without explicit statement. The final image—hands moving from fragile reeds to enduring stone—reweights permanence vs. transience as communal continuity rather than individual legacy. Subtext in Lyra’s silent offering of the cloth conveys acceptance more than dialogue could. Resonance lingers in the transformed ache.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kaelen’s perceptual bias: light refracts “with a light that was not daylight,” reeds fall “to the ground” in a single heartbeat. Syntax mirrors his patience—long, winding sentences while weaving, then clipped urgency overnight. No POV leakage; even Lyra’s smile is read through his emotional lens. Distinct texture sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet disciplined: “luminescent ache,” “webs of kinship” used once each and recharged at closure. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse under pressure beats, avoiding purple drift. Final line lands clean, crystallizing the shift without flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar outsider-seeks-belonging arc is refreshed by the living graffiti-as-gardener twist and the sculptor whose medium is fragility itself. Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor feel specific to this world, not generic fantasy. The reed-to-obsidian synthesis at the end is inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
