<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—rebellion against void yet reverence for hush—drives every micro-choice; the final bow-stroke renounces noise for resonant silence, costing her the grandfather’s loud past. Embodied emotion (“arms ached and her heart was full”) grounds the arc without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the single drop in the bowl reconfigures the entire hush from absence to voice, with felt cost in the ache of her arms. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each musical phrase layers density until the dome itself becomes instrument; no causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s rusted ribs and shipwreck ribs literally shape the music’s resonance, constraining her tactics; the cracked pane and ghost apple tree charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (salt air on bowhair, phantom blossoms) is filtered through her acoustic bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty within ruin—tightens via escalating harmonic shimmer that forces her to risk the last silence; the cost is the ache and the irrevocable shift from passive listening to active voicing of the hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the duet between ruin and remnant; the final drop reframes “unfinished” as alive. No moralizing—just the resonant silence left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: every sound is gauged by its absorption or echo; syntax lengthens with legato phrases then snaps on the drop. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes with scene needs—long sentences swell with arpeggios, then contract to the single drop. No loops or mixed metaphors; “ghost of a vibration” is precise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar eco-ruin trope into acoustic archaeology; the greenhouse-as-instrument concept feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky quiet ending lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>
