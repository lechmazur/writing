<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing threads, cross-referencing charts) that escalate to the decisive shelf-building; the final re-shelving of the case crystallizes his identity as “gardener of memory” with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak, though the “blithe” tag is asserted rather than dramatized. Motivation is consistent and intensifies under pressure, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers density (dust, gloom, tapestry decay) until the map snaps into focus and the case’s silence reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias shelves the case beneath the map, foreclosing further search with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, lantern light, and tapestry’s frayed threads are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Elias’s movements and charges the final shelf placement. Micro-setting (the felt-lined tray, the curved wall) functions as active constraint. No orientation drift; world rules remain consistent. The environment subtly mirrors internal shift from shroud to cherished blanket.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the shape of abandoned intentions—is signaled early and tightens through each decoded thread until the map forecloses alternative readings. One meaningful deepening: the case’s pulse confirms the map’s truth, narrowing options to reunion or acceptance. Cost is the acceptance of a future forever deferred. Agency remains with Elias throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as living garden emerges through concrete particulars (threads, case, shelf) without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from “humming” to “silent” case, reweighting loss as anticipatory. Final image offers non-literal answer: some roots need untangling to find sun. Complexity lingers—hope and grief remain entwined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—velveteen gloom, chess-clock hush—remains consistent under pressure. POV stays tight to Elias; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (short clauses at map reveal). Perceptual signature is selective and biased toward caretaker detail. No register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is purposeful (tapestry’s border as “language of knots”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer sentences for hush, clipped ones for discovery. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—cemetery gardener decoding marginalia in a silo—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of hidden maps and ghostly echoes are transformed through tactile specificity and emotional restraint. Final reconfiguration of the case from loss to anticipation is earned. No derivative echoes; risk-taking (quiet lyric closure) heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
