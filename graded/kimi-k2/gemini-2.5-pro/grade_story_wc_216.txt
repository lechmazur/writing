<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is textured and embodied (“thinning of the light within his own bones”), but the final beat leans on a summary epiphany rather than a visible, costly choice; the urn fragment anchors motive yet the shift to “suddenly timeless” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silo’s stored memory dissolves Kael’s borrowed-time dread, and the cost is the quiet acceptance that his own story ends where another’s is preserved. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the garage-sale lure pattern is taught early and pays off in the glass-shard key.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The emerald silo’s hum and translucent panel are vivid micro-settings that constrain the final action; the willow-ghost image on ceramic is specific and recharges at closure. Spatial choreography is clean, though the wider world remains impressionistic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the texture of lost time—tightens when the traveler’s message forces a decisive interface with the silo. The escalation is one deepening beat, but the felt cost (Kael’s relinquishment of his remaining time) is legible in the final chord.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the urn fragment’s journey from inert relic to living memory, culminating in the quiet redefinition of mortality as shared continuity. No moralizing; the final image of “lost feelings waiting to be rediscovered” invites reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and light. Compression (“longitude was just a word for longing”) is taught early and sustained; no head-hopping, and the final cadence modulates into hushed resonance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence layering sensory and conceptual weight. Minor scaffold (“he would hold it for hours”) is offset by rhythmic variety; no mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-Collapse time dyslexia with a garage-sale séance feels fresh; the willow-urn shard as memory key is a non-obvious synthesis that retroactively justifies the silo’s design. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
