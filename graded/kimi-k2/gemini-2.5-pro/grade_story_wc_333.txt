<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Locksmith’s interiority is spare but coherent; his quiet resolve and the single, embodied act of humming under starlight reveal motive without exposition. The mother’s grief is sketched through gesture and reaction rather than label, and the final awe is earned. No contradictory impulses are dramatized, so the 9+ gate is missed, yet the arc of liberation feels credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lock dissolves, the chord releases, and the idea is set free—cost is the irrevocable loss of the hair and the mother’s transformed grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of starlight → lattice → dissolution reweights the stake. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The salt-white circle, starlight, and ribbon are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; the micro-setting of the circle constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true. No props drift; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped music—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the star’s appearance triggers the disorientation sequence, foreclosing retreat. Cost is the dissolution of the lock itself. Agency is the Locksmith’s resonant hum; coincidence (star timing) complicates rather than rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of liberation vs. fear emerges through action: the lock’s dissolution is the non-literal answer. No moralizing; the final chord resonates without explanation. The mother’s shift from grief to awe embodies the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is star-biased and tactile. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free-indirect texture is stable; rhythm modulates with tension. Elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“ley lines of memory and starlight”) is voice-motivated and patterned early. Final cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-as-mystical-artisan trope is refreshed by starlight-as-tool and hair-as-lock. The concept of freeing an idea rather than a soul is non-obvious and fully committed. Specificity of ritual and sensory detail prevents cliché. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
