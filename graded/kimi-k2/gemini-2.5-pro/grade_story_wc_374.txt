<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism and taste-based detection are vivid, but her interiority stays mostly observational; the climactic “profoundly illuminated” shift is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; the aurora’s absorption of the storms delivers a resonant reconfiguration (CR) that reweights the premise. Orientation is swift, causality under Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent, and closure lands with conceptual cost—her quest reframed, not solved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lavender bluff, aurora, and tin ring are rendered with selective sensory economy; the ring’s final stillness against the vanished storms charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake—prove/disprove the emergent compass—tightens as carriers converge and weather systems merge; the aurora’s intervention deepens rather than resolves the mystery, leaving a felt cost of unanswered mechanism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of seeking mechanism versus myth emerges through Elara’s palate and the aurora’s wordless answer; no moralizing, only a reconfiguration of her scientific stance toward wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in synesthetic taste and precise diction (“coppery tang,” “lavender-scented air”); no head-hopping, rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold detected in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Weather-carriers summoned by living compass is a fresh synthesis; the aurora as participant rather than backdrop transforms familiar tropes. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
