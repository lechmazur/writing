<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession with the “mathematics” of grief is crisp and recursive, but the moment he pivots from observer to sentient engine is tell-dense, not dramatized; Anya remains thinly perceived. The embodied cost is present (he sheds her borrowed sorrow with deliberate speed), yet we glimpse little internal contradiction in Elias under pressure, so the re-contextualization registers more for Anya than for him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the vortex cadence tightens the ambient grief into geometric credence; closure lands as Charged Poise—the fractal on the card reweights both characters’ agency. One cost (Anya’s grief transformed, Elias untouched yet satisfied) is visible in the last beat: she steps out, card in hand, bearing the residue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The topaz walls and crystallized halo bathe every action in star-honey luminosity, directly constraining Elias’s calibration choices, but workshop layout stays vague; spatial choreography is marginally off. Sensory detail is lyric yet occasionally overactive, creating a slight shimmer-overload around the press.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“shape grief into a readable pattern”—is pinned early and distilled in the final imprint. Micro-middle: fracture of emotions into equation tightens stakes from raw sorrow to transferable artifact. No multiple reversals, yet centrifugal pressure suffices for a single-crescendo design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—grief as legible geometry—emerges from props and operator, not asserted. Final card reifies Anya’s pain as object without sermon, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. Complexity acknowledged: Anya’s loss neither diminished nor absolved, but re-mapped. Still, Elias’s detached closure edges away from the human scar, muting full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close drifts calmly along Elias’s perceptual ridges, modulating from metallic rasp to borrowed tremor without head-hop. Compression in the vortex beat is taught and rhythmic, not merely decorative. Dialogue is spare yet carries subtext (“Structure requires pressure”). Occasional elevated diction (“interlocking theorems”) slightly overpolishes the mechanical voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>High metaphor density sometimes stacks three vehicles in two lines—yet pattern-taught by the accretion of light-/metal-/star lexicon. Sentence rhythm breathes around the lever-pull, accelerating into the operational thud. Filter verbs are minimal, scaffolding limited; “crystallized light” might lean poetic, but its function stays legible within the piece’s internal rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Central premise—letterpress as grief algebra—feels fresh and inevitable, synthesizing steampunk, intangible cosmology, and interior pain. No contemporary echo gluts the design; it trusts specificity (type slugs clicking like bones) to brand its own daylight on the trope field.</comment>
