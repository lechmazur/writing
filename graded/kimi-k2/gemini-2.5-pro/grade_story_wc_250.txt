<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied ("cold ache that resonated"); traits shape choices (patience, empathy). Endurance closure—“to teach darkness the value of stars”—is rooted in prior portrayal, cost visible in the lone sliver kept open. Absence of other characters removes relational crucible; only minor slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pattern of shutter-light reweights the stake. Closure lands as earned stasis—a promise kept, darkness pacified—and the beam sent into the canal carries felt price. Linkage across beats maintains coherence; no causal lapse.</comment>

<comment>Dock after rainfall is viscerally present, every slat and sheen integral to the light-weave. Micro-setting—the dental mirror and shutter lattice—constrains tactics and charges final image.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake signaled early (“darkness… taken root”). Tension tightens by calibrated micro-intensifications; the soft glow-answer from the canal marks a visible price. Conflict deepens rather than reverses; cost legible in the quietened water.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ambitious theme coheres without manifesto: learning, loneliness, the worth of small lights. Emerges from concrete choices—woven shutters, a mirror’s beam—culminating in the charged image of darkness “knowing it is not alone.” No late explanatory gloss.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person selective focus sustains perceptual signature of patient guardianship; prose sculpts quiet rhythms that mirror interior stillness. Consistent POV, subtle psych-distance shifts serve mood rather than exposition.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet precise: “gleaning like wet ink” fresh, syntax modulates to mimic Kaelen’s slow weaving motion. Scaffolding minimal; density high, no loop artifacts near closure.</comment>

<comment>Reconceives horror-ghost tropes into a gentle pedagogy of loneliness. Guardian and light-weave feel singular; conventional “canal monster” transformed by quiet humanism, bold yet coherent.</comment>
