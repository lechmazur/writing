<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s eccentricity is embodied in her scent-cataloguing and psychometry, but the final renunciation—“to understand its impossibility”—is stated more than dramatized; the cost is felt yet not fully embodied in a micro-choice on the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara leaves the compass and the lagoon, foreclosing capture with visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers scent, silence, and revelation until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The limestone fissure, glowing lagoon, and mineral breath are vivid and selective; the lagoon’s luminescence constrains the final choice by making bottling impossible. Spatial choreography is clean, and the scent motif threads every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the place where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightens when the compass fails and psychometry drains her. The final renunciation carries felt cost, though the escalation is more accumulative than sharply reversive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Theme emerges through scent, silence, and renunciation: the sacred cannot be catalogued. The ending’s image of the still compass reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to olfactory and mineral detail. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses in the tunnels, longer cadences at the lagoon—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“scent of ancient starlight”) and never muddies causality. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The petrichor-collector premise, psychometry-guided descent, and luminous lagoon synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels both surprising and foreordained.</comment>
