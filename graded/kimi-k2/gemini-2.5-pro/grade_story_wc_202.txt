<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“cool, familiar weight” of the lens), but the protagonist’s contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final act of “unfastening” feels inevitable yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painting’s lie is corrected and the forgotten crew is acknowledged. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the transition from market to canvas-world is slightly elided, blurring the moment of decisive action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is rendered with selective, sensory economy; the lens itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clear, but the reef’s absence/presence shift could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring erased histories—is signaled early and tightened through the discovery of the *St. Elmo*. The “unfastening” act narrows options, yet the price paid (loss of the lens’s weight?) remains more poetic than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as moral obligation, history as palimpsest. The final image of the “somber, corrected light” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent (“ozone”-smelling canvases). No head-hopping; diction remains within the narrator’s lexicon. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful. Minor loop: “history…history” in first paragraph, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—truth hidden in deliberate painting errors—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky rooftop market setting is grounded; no close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
