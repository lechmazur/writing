<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “silent verse” and “stanza of perfect control” reveal motive through motion. The contradiction between chastity and power is dramatized in the dance that untangles grief; the cost is the “immense burden” released in the final sigh. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Micro-choices (tracing patterns, miming the final pull) align with motive and foreclose her role as mere collector.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each harvested echo layers psychic weight until the prism’s silent wave reconfigures the city’s emotional field. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—colorless light returns hidden truths with conceptual cost (“not a revolution of swords, but of whispers”). Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. The final smile crystallizes the stance without tidy exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, falling snow, and prism sanctuary are vivid yet selective; the prism’s “breathing” light constrains the final action and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent—Elara moves from periphery to center, then releases the wave outward. Weather mirrors internal serenity without cliché. Micro-setting (prism) functions as both tool and setting, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying conformity via subliminal rebellion—is signaled early and tightened through the dance of untangling. Each knot’s release escalates psychic pressure until the final thread (judge’s regret) triggers the wave. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elara forfeits her role as secret keeper and becomes the city’s conscience. Agency drives every beat; coincidence absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of hidden humanity versus rigid power emerges through concrete particulars—grief, ambition, terror—rather than assertion. The prism’s silent flash offers a non-literal answer: truth returned untangled. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “whispers.” Final image reweights earlier motifs (snow, silence, light) without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, matching Elara’s controlled grace. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, sinuous sentences during harvest, then a single breath for release. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within POV bounds. Distinct perceptual signature: “spectral residue,” “frozen tears,” “colorless light.” Patterned elision (e.g., judge’s name) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“lattice of crystal… frozen tears”). Rhythm accelerates during the dance, then exhales with the sigh. Minor elevation in diction fits the elevated stakes. Clean grammar and spatial clarity throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise—chaste courtesan as psychic liberator—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes of courtesan and rebellion are transformed through embodied ritual and conceptual cost. Specificity of “harvest of echoes” and prism sanctuary anchors universals. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
