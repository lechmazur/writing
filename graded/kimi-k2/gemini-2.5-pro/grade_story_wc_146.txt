<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is spare but consistent; the “infinitely patient” trait is embodied in the deliberate footfalls and the refusal to rush the revival. Motivation (“restore shared balance”) is stated rather than dramatized, yet the final commitment to return tomorrow shows a micro-choice with cost (endless labor). No contradictory impulses are staged, so the arc feels linear rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s silence is re-tuned from void to pregnant hush, anchored by the fork’s permanent hum. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each footstep layers density until the spectral crowd coheres. Orientation is swift; the archway and twilight anchor place and time by line 4. The only gap is the off-stage “Collapse,” but its absence does not rupture the on-page logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked archway, bruised twilight, and cobblestones under boot leather are vivid and selective. The fork’s hum becomes a micro-setting that constrains every step. Weather is minimal, but the creeping dawn supplies temporal pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the town’s lost resonance—is signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative: each street adds spectral footfalls, tightening the texture without a single causal reversal. The cost is diffuse—Elias’s endless return—yet it is legible on the final line. No coincidence resolves the tension; the work is Sisyphean and acknowledged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of balance-as-rhythm emerges from action, never sermon. The fork’s hum and footfalls form a quiet meditation on restoration through attention rather than force. The ending reweights the premise: revival is not a state but an ongoing cadence. No tidy moral is offered; ambiguity lingers in the “promise of return.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, patient, and tactile—“sculptor of echoes,” “weight and rhythm they once knew.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with Elias’s stride. No dialogue appears, so voice convergence is moot. The perceptual signature is consistent and atmospheric, modulating with the spectral shimmer.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances image or cadence. No loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“bruised twilight,” “spectral imprint”) are precise and non-contradictory. Rhythm mirrors the walking meditation; no monotony. Opening and closing lines are strong, the latter recharging the fork’s hum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The “bell tuner who tunes towns” is a fresh synthesis of sound-magic and urban archaeology. Revival via footstep-rhythm is non-obvious yet internally coherent. No trope feels stock; even the ghost-town frame is reanimated through acoustic resurrection. The risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
