<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—wild impatience vs. sculpting patience—drives every micro-choice; the final click embodies earned renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“wild animal clawing at her ribs”) is specific, not diagnostic. No second character on page, so relationship bullets waived. One reflective block (grandfather’s theft) is anchored and tilts tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: the viaduct’s hum dies, freedom dawns, and the cost is the lifelong restraint Kaelen now irrevocably releases. Causal lens holds: each beat (rain-sheen, moon-meridian, coded pulse) tightens options until the single irreversible act. Orientation anchored by 120 words. No lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and rain-slick viaduct are not backdrop; the wet surface’s reflective fidelity is critical to the harmonic key that severs control. Micro-setting (obsidian bowl, brass scope) constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven and purposeful. Weather actively alters the magnetic field, guiding choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quiet severance of Authority’s yoke—signaled early. Escalation is causal: rain → altered viaduct → moon convergence → single pulse. One meaningful tightening suffices; the final blackout is earned, not coincidental, with audible cost in the vanished lifelong hum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of restraint-as-revolution emerges from concrete particulars (moon charts, obsidian bowl) without moralizing. Final image of “serene and terrible victory” reweights prior motifs. Subtext in the Authority’s blind arrogance versus celestial patience is implicit. No thematic drift or final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: precise, tactile, slightly archaic diction (“celestial meridian,” “unyoke”) that fits the POV’s vocation. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped beats at climax. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“scroll of frozen white”). High information density without clutter. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial mechanics as quiet insurgency, patience weaponized. Magnetic viaduct and moon path tracking are specific, non-generic. Transformation test fails—story could not swap elements without collapse. Risk in subdued climax pays off; restraint itself becomes the revolution.</comment>
