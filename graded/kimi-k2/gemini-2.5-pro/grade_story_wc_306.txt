<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s tremor, the unhooking of the cloak, and the envelope of cash all embody contradictory impulses under pressure; the conscience-for-hire’s own motivation remains slightly abstract, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: campfire ember → chime oracle → shard void → cloak release → lighter man walking away. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the cloak surrendered to wind).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse catwalk, wind chimes, and North Atlantic dawn are filtered through POV priorities; the wind itself constrains the final gesture and charges the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Kaelen will cling to righteous certainty—tightens once when the brass clang fights the shells; the decisive act (unhooking cloak) forecloses revenge and exacts a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of doubt as protective wisdom emerges through the wind’s impartial music and the hollow shard’s void; no explicit moralizing, only a charged final image that reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile wind, metallic taste of salt, and ritual cadence; no POV drift. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden (“I offer something more useful”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; occasional lyrical lift (“ghost of heat,” “scripture he’d suddenly forgotten”) stays purposeful. No loops or register drift; final paragraph cadence earns its poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Conscience-for-hire who reads wind chimes as moral oracle feels fresh; the hollow shard and cloak-of-doubt conceit transform familiar revenge-into-wisdom arc into something specific and inevitable.</comment>
