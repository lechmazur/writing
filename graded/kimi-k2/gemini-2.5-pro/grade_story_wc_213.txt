<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s quiet curiosity is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing resonance, finding the rope) and culminates in a costly renunciation; the final silence carries felt weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the switch diverts power, the rope tunes the spire, and the storm parts—cost is the obliteration of the siren’s intended safety. Causal lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The floating sanctuary, wind-scoured stone, and cathedral rope are not backdrop but instruments; the rope literally constrains the final act, charging the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“hear the sky’s true voice”—tightens through countdown beats; the switch forecloses the sirens’ path with irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening vs. noise emerges from concrete acts (data tracing, rope pull) and crystallizes in the final hum; no moralizing, only reweighted silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere without loops or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Storm-siren sanctuary fused with cathedral rope and cosmic alignment yields a fresh, inevitable synthesis; risk-taking pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
