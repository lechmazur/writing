<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vividly embodied: Elias’s empathy and need for shelter clash in real-time when he “stays while leaving.” The final softening—and cost—of leaving the smoothed invitation under Elara’s lamp lands with prior motivation fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because he fears the storm, therefore he hides; seeing Elara’s sorrow rewrites the map, and the invitation placed untouched becomes a crystallizing Charged Poise with felt cost. No plot holes, no amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hidden laundromat façade and the rotunda clock anchor space and time, but while the scent-of-paper motif constrains Elias’s tactic of dissolving into the library, it is the emotional shelter—not the physical space—that constrains the final choice, just missing 8.8 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the paradox of connection vs overwhelm—is signaled early, tightens once when Elias witnesses Elara’s grief, and narrows to the single act of leaving the invitation: a decision that re-weights their shared solitude with a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from specific images (scent of paper, star maps in Elara’s lap, invitation left behind). The final tranquility is conceptual repricing, not moralizing—shared loneliness re-valued into quiet constellation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Third-person-limited interiority is steady and textured: “frantic bird against his ribs,” dissolved awareness into “patient hum of dormant knowledge.” Prose shifts cadence with pressure, voice never leaks outside Elias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Dense double-duty lines (“he left it there, an unsigned admission”) keep momentum; no scaffolding, no redundant perfume of paper or synonym loops. Metaphors stay physical and legible; rhythm is controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>The paradoxical library/laundromat, the psychic camouflage of “staying while leaving,” and the reversal from shelter=alone to shelter=shared all cohere into a singular, non-template experience. Risk and specificity both high.</comment>
