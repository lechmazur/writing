<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—fighting vs. accepting the memory—is dramatized in the final descent; the embodied cost (loss of buoyancy, re-absorption of fractured selves) lands on the page. Motivation stays consistent: conquer the labyrinth by re-experiencing the drop. Micro-choice to “open himself to the memory” directly triggers closure. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct stabilizes, dawn replaces sterile glow, Kael stands solid—cost is the felt surrender of flight and reintegration of pain. Causal lens holds: accepting the memory (cause) halts procedural generation (effect). No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by second paragraph. One meaningful tightening—memory acceptance narrows options to a single coordinate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain is not backdrop; its shifting geometry and oppressive light actively constrain Kael’s tactics until the final stabilization. Micro-setting (tablet, boots, droplets) doubles as tools that charge the ending. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—ozone, wet metal, internal light—filtered through Kael’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as he drifts up and descends to the origin point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the loop by confronting the memory—is signaled early. Escalation is causal: each refusal feeds the maze; acceptance arrests it. One decisive tightening when Kael chooses the origin coordinate, foreclosing all other paths. Cost is the embodied surrender of weightlessness and the psychic re-absorption of despair.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of self-reconciliation emerges from the procedural-maze conceit and the memory of loss; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from “map” to “codex of rules” and the final image of meaningless scratches in dried mud. Final dawn light reweights prior darkness without statement. Complexity preserved: pain is not erased, only integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: metallic tastes, fallen-star droplets, “sterile, unblinking eye” for the bridge. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer reflective sentences compress into the decisive “He touched down.” No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely on internal texture, which remains consistent. Experimental elision (fractured Kaels) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density: “drop and the ripple” packs cause-effect; “procedural generation” is unpacked through action, not exposition. Rhythm breathes—floating ascent vs. solid touchdown. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“residue of familiarity”) fits the reflective mode and does not intrude on peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-as-seed for a procedurally generated purgatory. Trope of time-loop prison transformed by grounding the algorithm in a single traumatic moment. Risky second-person echo (“you had to retrace”) is avoided; instead, interior logic stays tight. Final image of inert tablet and grey dawn feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
