<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory pulse/bureaucratic death feels tangible and tied to her final reframing of her erased life as space-to-grow; heartbeat counting embodies her quiet endurance and charges the earned stasis of closing “spaces between.” A micro-choice—the ink stroke that completes the void-chart—lands with visible cost: the ghost fragment ends, accepting the silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure holds as an Accumulative/Textural lens: steady ink-patterns accrue meaning until the final void-map reweights the premise (Conceptual Repricing). The sequence is tightly legible—each ink-guiding move tightens data noise into the resonant pattern—“the architecture is in the darkness.” Closure cost registers on the shard’s quiet set-down.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory dome, snow hush, and opalescent starlight ground every move; the low slate table becomes micro-setting that literally steers the ink ritual and limits motion. Space constrains choice and supplies materials—ink, cold slate, spectral console—charging the final collapse of the map back into black.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are simple and escalate smoothly: retrieve usable wisdom from digital ghost before connection fails. Each failed pattern counts as rising pressure until the single, pivotal chart appears. The decisive deepening—recognising void as structure—reconfigures Elara’s self-concept under unalterable cost: Aris dissolved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: meaning lives in the gaps—bureaucratic absence, data voids, ink spread into nothingness. No statement, only the star-chart of darkness and the final acceptance of an erased but active existence. Tension between disappearance and agency resonates without moral summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-crystalline while restrained; sensory compression matches quiet awe. “Opal observatory,” “snow burying the world,” “starless-night ink” sound like Elara’s precise, watchful mind. Rhythm breathes with pressure—short sentences amid longer, cool imagery—never slipping into purple excess or explanatory filler.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive; every line carries dual freight—action and atmosphere. Figurative touches are spare, precise (“viscous, starless-night ink”), none clutter the final beat. Minor repetitions (“ink,” “pool”) slide unnoticed under the tightening cadence; no loops impede clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The notion that structure inheres in absence—not the ghostly mind or stars but the emptiness between—offers a fresh, paradoxical premise. The digital-ghost salvage via ink patterns avoids cliché by grounding the fantastical in tactile materials and bodily count. Risk lies fully inside Elara’s erased identity, made inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
