<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelan's manic laughter and embodied exhaustion anchor his interiority; the final chuckle that "the dawn was beginning to shape him" crystallizes a credible shift. Motivation is clear, but the lack of contradictory impulse mid-scene keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the storm is tamed, but Kaelan sees unintended prophecy in the new light—felt cost in his trembling wonder. Causal chain (storm→lighthouse→patterns→consequence) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse, crystalline wick, and cosmic storm are vivid and selective; the tower's shudder and glass nova constrain the final moment. Spatial choreography is clean; only the "dark continents" remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shaping the storm—tightens as the wick glows white-hot and the tower resonates; cost is visible exhaustion and the unforeseen prophetic echo. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of creation-through-destruction emerges from the storm-painting ritual; the final image of dawn "imbued with a strange and vital resonance" reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kaelan's laughter modulates from manic to shadowed wonder; prose rhythm mirrors the storm's crescendo. No POV leakage; diction stays within his arcane lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density—"solid spear of green," "celestial graffiti"—with no loops. Occasional elevated diction ("nascent energy") is voice-consistent. Final paragraph breathes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-herald as cosmic graffiti artist, glass wick as paintbrush. Risky lyric compression pays off in the prophetic twist. Transformation test passes—story would collapse if elements were generic.</comment>
