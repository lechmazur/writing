<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his nervous fingers, calibrated voice, and deliberate ritual choices reveal a man anchoring ideals in practice. The generals’ granite masks and trembling hand externalize decades of hatred and exhaustion, making the signing credible. The only gap: Vorlag’s surrender feels slightly compressed; a beat of embodied hesitation would push this to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the twin moons’ unified light crystallizes the cost of peace while the dust sigil reweights the treaty from words to ancestral bond. Causal chain holds—ritual persuasion → Kaelen’s tremor → Vorlag’s grunt—each step narrowing options until signatures foreclose war. No orientation drift; terrace, moons, and dust are anchored early and return charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The terrace’s cracked marble and night-blooming jasmine are not backdrop but pressure: the decaying reliefs remind the generals of empires turned to dust, and the scraped marble dust literally becomes the ink’s covenant. Two moons act as a live clock, their conjunction tightening the moment. Only the moss feels briefly ornamental; otherwise every sensory choice constrains the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ending the Forever War—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through ritual escalation: each beat (history lesson, sigil, dust) raises the social cost of refusal. The decisive narrowing occurs when Kaelen’s trembling hand signs, forcing Vorlag’s surrender; the price is the generals’ public renunciation of identity. Agency remains with Elias’s orchestration, not coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemption’s price emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement: the treaty’s value is reweighted from parchment to ancestral dust, making forgiveness a material debt. The final image of twin moons touching offers a non-literal answer—peace is possible only when separate orbits briefly align, at measurable cost. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the terrace’s continuing decay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s calibrated perception; diction (“operatively gentle,” “midwife a peace”) is character-specific and rhythmic. Compression is purposeful—no head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. The only minor slip: one line edges toward editorial omniscience (“the flawed beauty of the scene was breathtaking”), but it serves the ritual frame and does not rupture voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “marble beneath his worn boots cracked like a shattered promise” does triple duty—setting, character, theme. Rhythm modulates from languid celestial description to the clipped final beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors; even the elevated register feels earned by the ceremonial stakes. One near-repeat of “slow dance” is negligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar peace-treaty premise is transformed through ritual specificity: using ancestral marble dust as ink and a once-per-century lunar conjunction as deadline. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—celestial mechanics and mortal grudges braided into one charged moment. Risk lies in the compressed word count, but the payoff justifies the tight frame.</comment>
