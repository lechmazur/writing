<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Celeste’s contradictory impulses—protecting her father’s memory while dismantling the journalist’s lie—are dramatized in the phone call and the handling of the nib. The final renunciation (public vindication at private cost) is earned by the causal chain of proofs. Minor slip: “devotedly observant” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each “if-then” dismantles Davies’s premise, tightening toward the decisive revelation that reconfigures both stories. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Celeste accepts permanent loss of inheritance and public ambiguity for her father’s posthumous peace. Cost is legible in the final image of clouds and stars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s glass wall and rotating dome supply spatial pressure: isolation enables the risky phone confrontation, and the star-field reflection charges the final image. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting that constrains the argument’s credibility. A touch more sensory anchoring in the first 120 words would have lifted it further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—father’s reputation vs. truth—tightens through each logical blow, narrowing Davies’s options until Celeste’s stance crystallizes. The felt cost (loss of yacht/inheritance) is on-page. One tightening is sufficient and cleanly executed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited guilt and the ethics of public shame emerges from the concrete proofs and the nib’s reappearance. Final image of “silent paths” offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Avoids explicit thesis, though “orbits of regret” edges close to label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Celeste’s precise intellect; free-indirect modulation under pressure is clean. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. One minor register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction in narration—keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, motive, and logic. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“planet tethered…”) are apt and brief. Final paragraph’s cadence shift earns the quiet closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “rich daughter vindicates disgraced parent” arc is transformed through the proof-by-contradiction structure and the astronomical frame. Specificity of the nib and the Argent Mining detail make the premise feel singular rather than template.</comment>
