<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Contradiction between enduring optimism and the reality of ruin: shown in embodied choosing to stitch even when storm looms. Choice at climax to swap dream-threads for storm-grade rope seals arc with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal clarity: copper plate vision → unconscious stitching → conscious anchoring; final storm tightens threads into stone. Orientation anchored in single scene, one shard to shelter, closure via humming wind-kissed threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Labyrinth body-tool hybrid: canyon walls limit sewing routes, petal-stalk fiber rope feels tactile; micro-setting guides knot-work, tunes atmospheric note.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation: unconscious art-grown latticework → conscious fight to secure it against storm; pressure forces public-works shift from private dream to community survival walk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Path from ruin to reverence reframed by ending: broken precedents rewoven into living map; image of humming threads revalues memory as shoreline to revere, not mourn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyric, textured prose (“kelp-fiber rope” “dolphin-leap arc”); POV voice stays filtered through tactile weaver bias; rhythmic ascent under storm even through compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high density (“parched earth” “bruised yellow sky”); figurative precision supports pressure; no scaffold/artifact, propels forward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sleep-walk stitching as communal unconscious craft feels fresh; transforms trope of oracle dream into participatory mass art; specificity feels inevitable—threads pulled taut by wind singing a coastline.</comment>
