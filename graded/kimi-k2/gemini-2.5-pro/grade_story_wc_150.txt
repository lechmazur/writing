<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for certainty while fearing the truth—remains embodied in her tactile, slow excavation. The moment she traces the root across bone and later lifts the sundial base, micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values (ancestral connection over efficiency). Final renunciation of the “tragic end” myth carries visible emotional cost: the hollowness she arrived with is replaced by acceptance, but only after physical labor and re-framed memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship etching reframes the diaspora narrative from failure to perpetual departure, with conceptual cost—the family myth is forever altered. Causal chain holds: wandering → discovery → excavation → inscription → redefinition. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. One minor tightening beat (lifting the stone) suffices for 800-word scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is not backdrop; the roots gripping bones and the sundial’s displacement physically constrain Elara’s movements and timeline. Sensory selection (damp soil, faint blossoms) mirrors her cautious hope. Final sunlight on limestone recharges the setting as testament to continuity, not decay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore faith in lineage—tightens when the sundial’s underside forces a reevaluation. Agency: Elara’s choice to lift and place the stone crystallizes the new stance. Cost is the irreversible reframing of family memory. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ship etching converts diaspora from loss to ongoing courage. Subtext operates in the silent embrace of roots and bones. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. No motif checklist; the sundial’s return is earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s biased perception (“warmly curious,” “profound hollowness”). Syntax breathes with her meditative pace; no head-hopping. Distinct diction—“gnarled pear root,” “bleached-white clavicle”—anchors voice in body and place.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. High information density: each sentence advances mood, action, or backstory. Metaphors (“slow-motion embrace”) are precise and integrated. No overwriting in peak beat of lifting the stone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: diaspora memory reconfigured through orchard ossuary and displaced sundial. Risky setting choice grounded in sensory detail. Transformation test passed—plot fails if elements are generic. No derivative premise penalty.</comment>
