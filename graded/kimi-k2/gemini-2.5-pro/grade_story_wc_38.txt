<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's embodied motivation—encrypted vulnerability into strength—remains vivid; the moment she lifts the dice and accepts chance as surrender is earned. Earlier interiority is concrete (the lab as cage, the journal as ghost-reclamation). Missing: tangible trade-off or visible scar resulting from the choice—cost is felt but abstract and interior, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure thickens through recursive code-knots and maternal absence. Closure is an Earned Stasis: random dice roll + own poem reframes the lab’s hum into harmonic coexistence; the price (permanent underwater life, chance now inside her system) is legible in the resonant chord/fractal on the screen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sub-aquarium gloom ("quartz-glass walls", "bioluminescent algae") is never mere wallpaper; the water pressure modulates into the final sound-shift. Micro-objects (dice, journal, console) serve as tools that constrain and charge the final image. Only the lab’s spatial layout could be sharper when Elara dances among terminals.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free her mother’s splintered consciousness—remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when chance replaces logic, narrowing the decryption method from pure analysis to embodied surrender. Cost is largely conceptual/psychic rather than externalized obstacle, fitting the word count yet leaving the tightening less visceral than exceptional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering to uncertainty emerges implicitly: the dice transmute “control” into “acceptance.” Final fractal image reweights earlier motifs (web, spider) without moralizing. Familial love plus scientific legacy braid quietly; complexity preserved. Late phrase “felt gratitude” drifts toward sentimentality—minor but noticeable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical registers the protagonist’s inner music: elongated sentences flow like water, fragments tighten mid-dance. Vocabulary (“lyrical code breaker”) is controlled POV lexicon; no head-hop. Minor clump of echoing soft modifiers (“quiet”, “silent”, “calm” cluster) flattens rhythm mid-section otherwise elegant.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong read-aloud cadence; water-borne pauses mirror thought. One small paraphrase loop “hum … dirge … hum” costs nothing. Metaphors stay coherent and purposeful (“fractal bloomed like a snowflake”). Tense solid; all pronouns clean. No artifacts obscure meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea cryptology with dance-as-algorithm is specific and memorable. Dice-as-entropy key flips genre assumptions. No derivative echoes of famous lines; risk (chance over logic) pays off. Final fractal payoff is inevitable yet unhackneyed. Could edge into exceptional if one more visible external cost scarred the world.</comment>
