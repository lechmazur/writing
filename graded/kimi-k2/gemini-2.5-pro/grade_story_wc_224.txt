<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“the thunder in her chest”), and her micro-choices (shelving, feather touch) align with motive. The buried-talent arc resolves in earned stasis—she foregoes nightly escape for rooted presence—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the stone anchors her to the present, reconfiguring her stance with conceptual cost (“clean, hopeful scent of rain”). Accumulative lens holds—each beat layers texture until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bookstore-mountain is vivid, selective, and purposeful; skylight-lit chamber and aviary dome constrain movement and supply key resources. The setting’s breathing entity metaphor charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“shape of home”—is signaled early and tightens once when the stone disappoints, forcing a deeper method. The feather-beat escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens, with felt cost in her trembling hand, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of home as foundation emerges organically from tactile particulars; the final dream of “soil and deep roots” offers resonant non-literal closure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, with mercury-glass imagery and rhythmic modulation under pressure. POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (“phantom ports or nonexistent forest”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“quiet opening of a flower in the dark”). Minor filter-verb clusters in reflective beats keep it from 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest-for-belonging arc is transformed through the bookstore-mountain and non-verbal stone, yielding a fresh synthesis. The feather-as-key feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick.</comment>
