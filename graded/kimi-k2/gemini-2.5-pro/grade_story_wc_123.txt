<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias’s internal contradiction—data fidelity vs. exposure risk—surfaces in embodied micro-choices (pocketing the parchment, deciding not to force a path) under escalating watch. The arc earns its quiet renunciation by lateral infiltration instead of direct confrontation, closing his solitude at cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as earned lateral movement: impossible barometric data → map of subterranean shafts → promise to follow the storm-that-wasn’t. Drive lens is causal: mystery coordinates force reweighted decision, narrowing from “be chased” to “quietly pursue.”</comment>

<comment>Courtyard anchors with tactile ivy and cooling stone; later, lit ventilation shafts beneath the zone transform from atmospheric backdrop into literal escape route, constraining Elias’s final move.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Unseen watchers raise stakes from suspicion to pursuit; impossible storm data tightens options to lateral infiltration. Pressure crystallizes in Elias’s one quiet decision that forecloses frontal involvement.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of integrity through solitary rigor emerges via event—storm data that can’t exist demands personal integrity to investigate rather than report. Final lateral descent offers non-literal answer: solitude preserved by subterranean truth-seeking.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays precise; selective details reflect a data-centric eye until bird’s traumatized wing jars complacency. One shift to “climate of nerves” renders physics metaphor without head-hop; rhythm controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Concise, high density: every sentence advances motive or atmosphere. No loops, filter-verbs minimal; vivid “storm-that-wasn’t metaphor” shows pressure without overwriting. Read-aloud cadence sharpens toward final descent.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: ignored subterranean transit maps transform from functional trivia into tactical solution. Lateral infiltration is an elegant, non-obvious angle that reweights familiar pursuit tropes with stakes intact.</comment>
