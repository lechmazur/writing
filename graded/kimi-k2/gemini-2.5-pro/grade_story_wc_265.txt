<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the gear’s tactile presence anchors identity. The final shift from “stray” to “guided” is earned through sensory ordeal and costs the comfort of ignorance. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear reweighted from broken fragment to integrated symbol, cost paid in relinquished victimhood. Causal lens holds—each sonic cue tightens navigation toward the quartz tree. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanical rainforest is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (copper moss, lubricant rivers) that constrains movement and supplies acoustic navigation tools. The quartz cathedral functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. One notch below 9 only because environment does not physically impede beyond ambience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the logic of translocation—tightens via sonic decoding until the final reconfiguration forecloses randomness. Cost is the surrender of prior self-definition (“stray”), felt on the page. Escalation is steady and lens-coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of participation versus victimhood emerges organically from the protagonist’s sensory apprenticeship; no explicit statement intrudes. Final image of the gear as “complete thing” offers resonant, non-moralizing answer to the quest for purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—philosophical yet tactile, with rhythmic control that modulates under the rising hum. No POV leakage; diction stays within the wanderer’s lexicon. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and precise. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. One minor hedge—“perhaps even the one that governed his strange condition”—could be trimmed, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Clockwork rainforest as psychic mirror is a fresh synthesis; the sonic navigation mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss. Specificity throughout prevents trope drift.</comment>
