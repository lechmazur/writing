<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific—her father’s locksmith legacy, the rosebush as daily greeting, the “wistfully pragmatic” sigh—yet the decisive choice to lower the tooth feels slightly under-motivated; we see the inherited creed but not the fresh trigger that makes tonight the night. The embodied emotion (salt-laced air, gentle engine of her arm) is vivid, and the micro-choice to keep the rhythm after the blinds twitch shows earned change with cost—her fatigue and continued vigil. Still, Mr. Henderson remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the blinds’ fractional inch is a Resonant Reconfiguration—light accepted, solitude cracked—felt in Elara’s shuddered breath and continued rocking. Causal chain is tight: last petal → need new tool → nightly ritual → response. Orientation is swift (fire escape, moonlit harbor, Mr. Henderson’s dark rectangle by ~120 words). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern of nightly effort tightening to a single image holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, cold iron, and the tiny steel tooth all constrain tactics: the moon supplies the light she borrows, the fire escape grants access, the tooth’s polish makes the beacon possible. Sensory selection is urgent—velvet petal, salt air, quivering hush—filtered through Elara’s gardener’s eye. Spatial choreography is flawless; the tooth’s descent and swing are tracked to the inch. The setting charges the final image: moonlit silver now dances inside the dark rectangle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she breach Mr. Henderson’s solitude without intrusion—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: nightly ritual, colder air, dormancy of other plants, then the fractional widening of blinds. Cost is visible in her tired arm and the risk of being noticed. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence never intervenes. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of gentle, non-invasive outreach emerges through concrete action, not statement. The lockmaster’s tooth repurposed from security to gift embodies the theme; the final dancing star answers the opening loss of the rose without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence between windows. Protected vulnerability modulates into shared heartbeat—earned resonance.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is gardener-precise (“bastion of green,” “chlorophyll and blossom”). Rhythm mirrors the oar-stroke she recalls, compressing under fatigue. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Diction remains within her lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical: “whisper of velvet,” “sheet of rippling silver.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Metaphors are coherent (tooth as star, rhythm as heartbeat). Minor elevation in register (“luminous harbor”) is justified by moonlit grandeur. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: locksmith heritage repurposed into guerrilla gardening via moonlight Morse. The rose-to-tooth transition feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk—quiet, almost static action—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids sentimentality through specificity.</comment>
