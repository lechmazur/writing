<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—desire for rationalism vs longing for inherited magic—are embodied in the physical act of trowelling: his knuckles white, the chill of the tooth, the tear traced through dirt. His final micro-choice is the pen on star-chart; this specific action revalues a lifetime’s certainty, and its cost (shattered worldview) is legible on the page. Interiority stays concrete—never drifting into label-speak—anchored in the tactile work of hands and bones.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the “impossible” tooth re-weights every previous explanatory stance; the new constellation makes a before/after of Elias’s life. Coherence under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the garden, the tooth, and grief accumulate density until the pattern of belief snaps. Micro-turn inside the findbox functions as the decisive shift; causality stays intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Walls of hedge, river-smooth stones, moon-petal roses: each detail does both aesthetic and tactical work, guiding the dig and fore-shadowing the find. Setting never drifts into wallpaper; instead the maze and the box constrain hand and time. Micro-setting (trowel, tooth) carries final symbolic charge without ornamental load.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: whether he will continue rationalist disavowal or pay the cost of belief. Pressure tightens through each physical sensation—dirt, sting, gleam—until the single choice to sit and draw stars narrows options forever. Price is irreversible loss of certainty, expressed in the chart’s black ink and visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges from accumulation: grief as fracture that must be set, the limits of skepticism, and the ethical cost of dismissing love’s truths. Final image reframes earlier star talk as constellations of failure—quiet, unspoken, and haunting. Sentimentality avoided; complexity arrives through the contradiction that proof destroys faith yet completes it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Control of psychic distance stays tight; sensory filtering remains Elias-specific (bone-setter’s awareness of pressure and snap). Rhythm modulates with rising fear: longer cadences in discovery, then clipped notation of charts. No register drift; every word feels rooted in a man who’s spent life reading the snap of bone.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density without clutter: “cartography of failures,” “bone setting required accepting the break,” “yearn for her unwavering belief” each do narrative and musical work. Figurative language is precise (‘flimsy as a cobweb in morning mist’) and never drifts into purple. Syntax varies to mirror trowel-press then breath-still moment of discovery.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Trope of “skeptic confronted by supernatural object” is remade by specific vocational lens—bone setting re-used metaphorically to fracture and mend not just limbs but belief systems. Rowan-wood box, moon-petal roses, changeling tooth all feel uniquely bound to this garden-maze world rather than generic placeholders.</question>
