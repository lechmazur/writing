<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her salt-stained fingers, the weight of the glass in her palm—but the final renunciation of “wrong fire” is slightly generalized rather than dramatized as a specific cost. The contradiction between memory of village fire and present resolve is present yet not fully enacted in a micro-choice; the glow is achieved without visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each polishing stroke thickens texture until the absorbed twilight reconfigures the grotto’s gloom. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis in which Elara forecloses the path of fire-light and accepts the quieter cost of solitude. The cost is felt in the final image: “a quiet light for a world that had grown too loud.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto’s mist and salt air are not backdrop; they pressure Elara’s need for an interior light and literally supply the cool medium that makes the luminescence legible. The teal shard itself becomes micro-setting, constraining how light can be held and shared. One more sensory tether to the body (cold stone under knees, etc.) would have nudged 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—create light without fire—tightens through tactile escalation: dull glass → vibrant core → self-sustaining glow. The single decisive intensification occurs when twilight strikes and the shard answers, narrowing options to this one quiet solution. Cost is implied (solitude, renunciation of prior fire), but not yet viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of patient, star-like illumination emerges organically from the polishing ritual and the grandmother’s meteor-shower memory; no explicit moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: light need not consume to exist. Subtext in the grotto’s protective curve around her suggests acceptance of quiet service over spectacle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“zephyr bloom,” “captured, liquid energy”—and remains anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias. No POV drift; every detail is filtered through her star-oriented gaze. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences during reflection, clipped fragments at the moment of absorption.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors are controlled—“a pearl of stillness”—and never obscure causality. One minor loop: “quiet, determined goal” followed by “quiet goal” two sentences later; otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest for inner light is refreshed by the specific coastal grotto, gem-polishing craft, and grandmother’s meteor lore. The transformation of trash-glass into star-core feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Slight risk in quiet ending is fully earned by prior texture.</comment>
