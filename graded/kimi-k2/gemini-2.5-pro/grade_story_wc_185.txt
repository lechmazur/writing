<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is embodied and specific—his “old bones protesting” and the “fortress of will” against the hum. Motivation (find the quiet) is clear and intensifies through micro-choices: extracting ice, tracing cracks, releasing the pattern. The final renunciation—accepting the eye of the storm rather than banishing it—earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in his exhausted repose. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush reweights the premise, turning the stone from amplifier to absorber. Causal chain holds—ice map → pattern internalized → release into stone → silence blooms—with each beat tightening options. Cost is legible in the cave’s shudder and Kaelen’s spent repose. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: the “salt-veined rock,” “Chamber of First Frost,” and the stone’s “gently luminous glow” all constrain choices. The harmonic caves evolve from torture chamber to resonant peace, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. Micro-setting (ice sheet) functions as map and catalyst, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the quiet—is signaled early and escalates as the hum sharpens to a “needle-point.” One decisive tightening: the conjuring moment where silence is risked against possible collapse. Cost is felt in the cave shudder and Kaelen’s exhaustion. Agency drives every beat; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence as active resistance emerges through action and image, never stated. The bloom of hush reweights the concept of quiet from absence to generative force. Final image—peace not as void but as textured presence—offers resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and tactile: “ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “conceptual void,” “symphony of nullity.” Syntax mirrors Kaelen’s precise, ritual mindset; rhythm tightens under pressure. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“hum had angles and edges,” “bloom of hush.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—silence as engineered counter-frequency—feels fresh and inevitable. Ice-map as cartography of silence is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in concept and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
