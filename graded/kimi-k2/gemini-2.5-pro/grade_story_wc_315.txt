<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his tremor, the buckle’s bite, the ghost of the rip-cord—but the “preserve trust” motive is stated more than dramatized until the final beat. The muscle-memory sequence is a sharp micro-choice that earns the steady hand, yet the prior debt to “those who slept” remains abstract. Still, the contradiction between duty and panic is palpable, and the cost lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: static clears → pattern anomaly → recalibration → silent warning. Each beat tightens options; the crystal dial is a literal fulcrum. Closure is a Charged Poise: the blue bracket appears, the world sleeps, the cost is the hollow ache and the knowledge he alone carries. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arbor above the clouds is sketched with ozone and wet-soil air, but the true setting is the console and the buckle—micro-settings that constrain every move. The lattice-branch walls and bioluminescent moss are sensory but secondary; the buckle’s cold weight and the crystal dial’s fragility are what finally matter. Environment shapes tactics without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent panic while ensuring defense—escalates cleanly: anomaly detected → recalibration risk → silent warning sent. One decisive tightening: the tremor versus the buckle ritual. Cost is the isolation and the “hollow ache,” visible on the page. Agency is entirely Kael’s; luck complicates, does not solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship and unseen sacrifice emerges through action and image, never sermon. The buckle’s reprise reweights from memento to stabilizing talisman; the silent scream across the system is the non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—was secrecy the right choice?—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and consistent: “thin and tasting of ozone,” “hair-thin ring of spun crystal.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Compression is purposeful; no register drift. The perceptual signature is Kael’s engineer-poet hybrid, noticing pattern and texture alike.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during calibration—“His fingers flew… heart hammering”—then exhales at the end. Sensory specificity replaces generic placeholders. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The lone sentinel above the clouds is familiar SF territory, but the fusion of parachute-buckle muscle memory with astrophysical recalibration feels fresh. The watcher’s burden is given a tactile, embodied solution rather than abstract angst. Specificity rescues the trope; the final silence lands as earned rather than staged.</comment>
