<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bead-triggered memories arrive as sensory jolts, not exposition. Lyra’s spectral pressure forces his micro-choices (touching toxic dew, tending the orchid) that reveal a hierarchy of values—knowledge over safety. The final transference lands as earned renunciation: Lyra dissolves, Elian accepts the cost of sole custodianship. Only the absence of on-page dialogue with Lyra keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s dissolution reweights the bead from key to keepsake and transfers alchemical legacy with visible cost—her erasure. Causal chain holds: bead → glimpses → recovered memory → orchid bloom → transference. Orientation is immediate; the greenhouse and endless night are anchored in the first sentence. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse is not backdrop but crucible: toxic dew, century orchid, and moon-petal vines constrain every move. Spatial choreography is exact—rows, racks, heart—so the ghost’s cameos track cleanly. The “endless night” outside compresses the world to glass walls, charging the final image when Lyra’s motes merge with it. One notch below 9 only because the wider geography remains symbolic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—completion of the alchemical legacy—tightens via toxic intensification of plants and accelerating apparitions. Each glimpse raises the cost of knowledge (acid dew, hallucinogenic perfume). The final orchid bloom is the decisive intensification that forecloses Lyra’s presence and secures the inheritance. Agency is Elian’s continued tending despite danger; no external coincidence resolves the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of love as poisonous nurture emerges through concrete horticultural stakes rather than statement. The bead’s spiral reappears in the orchid’s unfurling, reweighting both objects as vessels of trans-temporal obligation. Final image—motes dissolving into night—offers a non-literal answer: debt paid through self-erasure, knowledge preserved through loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the toxic beauty left behind.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, modulating from hushed observation (“his breath a lonely cloud”) to incantatory cadence at the bloom. Perceptual signature is Elian’s: every plant is catalogued by alchemical utility and sensual threat. No dialogue, yet internal monologue avoids filter verbs and stays character-bound. Occasional elevated diction (“mournful elation”) is earned by the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes (“intoxicatingly toxic,” “burn his skin like acid”). No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent and internally consistent. Rhythm accelerates into the bloom, then exhales into the final silence. One mixed metaphor—“lovingly venomous”—is accepted as thematic coinage rather than muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The ghost-bride-as-executor trope is inverted: she nurtures with poison to fulfill a debt, not seek absolution. Alchemical orchard as liminal afterlife workspace feels fresh, synthesized from gothic and laboratory imagery without cliché. The bead-to-orchid transference is a non-obvious mechanism for knowledge inheritance. Specificity of plant lore and spectral economics makes the premise irreplaceable.</comment>
