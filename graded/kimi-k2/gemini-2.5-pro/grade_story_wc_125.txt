<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rope’s tactile memory anchors his ethical playfulness. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—he forfeits both transcendence and curated oblivion. Minor slip: “ethically playful” is asserted more than dramatized until the final wry smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias reframes the Lumin’s offer from binary choice to perpetual threshold awareness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the softened light that becomes atmosphere, leaving him alone with the burden of double sight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The terra-cotta grotto and starlight function as micro-setting that constrains perception and frames the cosmic pattern study. The rope’s dust and clay bowl provide tactile anchors that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to respond to the Lumin’s ultimatum—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias decodes the pattern as map of consciousness. The deepening reweights the choice from binary to liminal awareness, with visible cost in his refusal of both options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the value of imperfection and liminality over totality. Subtext operates in the rope’s silent witness and the final softening of light. The ending offers a resonant, non-moral answer—poet as threshold dweller—without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature is poet’s synesthetic attention to texture and rhythm. Patterned elision (“shimmer of the being intensified”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrasing is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic post-contact scenario filtered through solitary poet’s tactile metaphysics. The rope’s reprise transforms a prison relic into a metaphysical compass. Risk-taking in quiet lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
