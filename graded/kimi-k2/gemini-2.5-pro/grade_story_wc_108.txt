<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is visceral and embodied—palms on cold metal, stomach lurch—while contradictory impulses (terror vs resolve) act simultaneously. Motivation pivots from programmed survival to self-authored purpose, earned by the child-cast cipher and the final choice to trigger containment. Micro-choice hierarchy is visible: fear of height vs need for truth, culminating in the trembling certainty that redefines identity. Only the late appearance of Julian keeps relationship crucible off-page, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: betrayal → shell whispers → library climb → cipher → containment command. Closure is a decisive change—Julian’s plan nullified, protagonist’s agency asserted—with felt cost in the earthquake-certainty that replaces fear. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality breaks. The emergency failsafe is foreshadowed by the child-cast code, satisfying the cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library ruin is tactile: rusted girders, starlight through mangled roof, decaying encyclopedias. Spatial choreography is coherent—ten-meter drop, loose panel, maintenance phone. Environment constrains the climb and supplies the decryption key via constellations, charging the final image. Micro-setting (child’s cast) functions as setting-object hybrid that reweights past and present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove vulnerability is power—signaled early and tightened when the cast’s cipher converts pain into tactical advantage. Escalation is causal: each decoded symbol narrows Julian’s options until the containment command forecloses escape. Cost is visible in the trembling body and the silent shell—evidence erased, past reclaimed. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: a ghost rewrites its own code. Subtext operates in the shell’s whispers and the cast’s smudged child-hand—pain as archive. Final image reframes vulnerability as weapon without moralizing. Resonant reconfiguration lands in the silent shell and flashing red lights, reweighting identity and betrayal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is taut, stuntman-specific: “I was firmly adaptive” becomes lived syntax under pressure. Perceptual signature filters every detail through acrophobia and kinetic memory. Compression is purposeful—no filler beats. Dialogue minimal but subtextual when Julian arrives; the smile-vanish is economical and chilling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “cold metal bit into my palms” marries sensation and stakes. Rhythm modulates with fear-height-calm-decrypt arc. Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are spare and grounded—no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise twist—programmed stuntman reclaims authorship—feels inevitable yet fresh. Child-cast cipher repurposes sentimental object as tactical code; constellation key is elegant and specific. Risk in collapsing memory, identity, and betrayal into 700 words pays off without gimmickry. Transformation test: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
