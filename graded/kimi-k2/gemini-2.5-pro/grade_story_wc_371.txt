<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, embodied grief and her tactile hoarding of the rye heel crystallize motive; the patrolman’s flicker of memory adds relational pressure. Interiority stays concrete, but the final “tenuous absolution” is more asserted than dramatized—cost is felt but not fully embodied in a micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (decay, seeds, bread) thickens until the patrolman’s nod reconfigures the courtyard from derelict to remembered. Closure lands as Charged Poise—options narrowed, memory reweighted—though the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moss-eaten colonnade and petrified bread function as micro-setting that constrains every action; thyme in mortar gaps literalizes the theme. Sensory hierarchy is tight, but the palace’s spatial layout could be one degree sharper to earn 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defiance against erasure—tightens when the patrolman appears; the moment of mutual recognition deepens rather than reverses. Agency is present but the cost (risk of arrest, social credit) remains more implied than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of sacred ordinariness emerges through seed, bread, and shared memory; no moralizing. The final image of dirt under fingernails reweights the premise without statement, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with a perceptual signature attuned to decay and scent. Syntax modulates with cold and grief; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, every line doing double duty; only a single soft filter (“felt like”) keeps it from 9+. No loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Guerrilla gardening as elegy feels fresh; the rye heel as relic is specific and irreplaceable. Risk is understated but coherent—no gimmicks, just quiet inversion of ruin.</comment>
