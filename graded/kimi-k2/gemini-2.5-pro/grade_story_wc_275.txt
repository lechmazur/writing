<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between nurturing hands and inherited violence is dramatized in the knife moment. The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “senselessly perceptive” leans label-speak, though it is quickly embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: sheathing the knife forecloses the bounty path with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory beat thickens the dome’s quiet until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dome, sandbag scrap, and knife function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal stakes; the final image reweights the dome’s quiet as resilient armor. Could use one more tactile anchor to reach 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—continuity versus chaos—tightens through escalating sensory pressure and the knife temptation. One decisive tightening: sheathing the blade narrows options with visible cost. Agency remains internal but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of chosen peace versus inherited violence emerges through concrete action and charged objects. Final image of the blooming rose offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the knife’s weight and the dome’s silence is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s plant-tuned senses. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“quiet here was older, deeper” echoes prior phrasing—but it serves cadence. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-collapse desert trope is refreshed through botanic empathy and the knife-as-legacy twist. Specificity of “inculcating plants with values” and the sandbag relic elevate it above template. Risk is quiet but coherent.</comment>
