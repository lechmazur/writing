<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kai’s interiority is vivid—his “study in balance” and the mallet’s “thousand impacts” ground motive. The moment he strikes the cedar, contradictory impulses (fear vs. performance) fuse into embodied action with visible cost: the orchard’s timbers now “humming with the storm’s song.” No relationship crucible is on-page, but the solo arc earns credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, causal lens: Razor Squall arrives → Kai maps fractal → strikes log → storm harmonized. Orientation anchored by word 80; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—the raft’s new tonal memory—paid for by Kai’s spent breath and the orchard’s altered timbre. No teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating orchard’s salt-and-blossom scent and groaning timbers constrain every move; the cedar log literally becomes the resonating body that turns wave-force into music. Micro-setting (mallet, charcoal node) charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survival of the fragile raft. Escalation tightens once—storm peak → Kai’s percussive counter-rhythm—foreclosing destruction and replacing it with harmonic endurance. Cost is the orchard’s structural fatigue and Kai’s exhaustion, legible in the final hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: chaos transmuted into art without a sermon. The storm-as-soloist metaphor reweights from threat to collaborator in the closing image. Subtext in the mallet’s grayed felt and the “restless euphony” lingers without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kai; perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic (“tasted of deep-water brine,” “cello-like moan”). Syntax flexes with pressure—short percussive clauses during strikes, longer lulls post-storm. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “blue hour bled,” “fractal generating patterns,” each image serves atmosphere or causality. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm mirrors scene tempo; final paragraph breathes with earned release.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating orchard + storm-conductor prophet synthesizes into a fresh, inevitable myth. The fractal-music conceit feels discovered, not imposed; removing any core image breaks the whole. Risky lyricism pays off in the resonant aftermath.</comment>
