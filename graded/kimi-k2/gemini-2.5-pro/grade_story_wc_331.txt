<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet obsession and tactile ritualism ring true; the scarf-touch beats show embodied memory, and the closing smile sells a credible micro-renunciation. Interior stakes stay intimate, yet the final Charged Poise feels proportionate to the scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ‘window’ dissolves and the library reverts—cost held in Elias’s trembling hands and the missed next knock. Causal chain is compressed but legible; no beat contradicts the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere saturates every beat—ozone, nightshade, humid silk—yet setting never overwhelms plot geometry. The Athenaeum’s shifting topology and quiet stacks constrain movement and focus the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where stories live”—receives one clean intensification when Elias actually glimpses the pool, then a tightening into inaction; the price is the vision’s vanishing and the choice to wait. Escalation is sufficient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-space and authorship-as-reach emerges through concrete procedure rather than sermon. The final hush feels resonant, though the poem’s thesis flirts with overtness and briefly undercuts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains a precise, slightly archaic cadence that mirrors a cataloguer’s mind. Focalization is locked tight; sensory bias and syntax feel individuated with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose dances between lyric density and procedural exactitude without clogging momentum. Sentence rhythm modulates with tension; only a marginal “a tattered silk scarf, its deep crimson faded…” clause risks purple drift, quickly reined in.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Synthesis of math-poetry library and analog-memory portal feels fresh and internally coherent. The conceit is high-wire, but grounded in tactile ritual, avoiding gimmickry. One near-line echoes Borges gently, yet the transformation feels sufficient.</comment>
