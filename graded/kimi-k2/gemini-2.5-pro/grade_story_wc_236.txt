<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her scent-loss is rendered through tactile compensations. The screw-reading beat shows contradictory impulses: fear of inadequacy vs. need to give comfort. Micro-choice—handing back the screw—forecloses her old life with felt cost. Secondary pressure from the old man is minimal but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s final breath reweights her loss into presence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drip and fog layer accrues until the sun shaft reframes meaning. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by 120 words. Cost is legible in her acceptance of scentless air.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog and water clocks create micro-setting that constrains perception and choice. The clepsydra glass becomes a tactile mirror of her new sensory limits. Weather shift from muffled grey to piercing light charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she still “read” meaning without smell—tightens once when the screw is placed in her palm. Escalation is accretive: each droplet and worn thread increases emotional density. Agency is shown in her deliberate translation of wear into feeling. No external reversals needed; deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of finding the extraordinary in the ordinary emerges through the screw’s re-humanization, never stated. Subtext lives in the midwife’s “music” the surgeon never heard. Final image reframes absence as weight, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—can this sustain her?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control matching the drip of clocks. Free indirect style stays consistent; no head-hop. Sensory substitution (“reading between the lines of physics”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext—old man’s rasp vs. Elara’s whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“liquid heartbeats,” “weathered landscape of his face.” No loops or scaffold. One minor register drift—“scuttling her life”—but forgivable under lyric pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—aromatherapist turned clock-mender who reads objects—feels inevitable yet fresh. Screw as conduit for birth-music is non-obvious and specific. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring causality. Transformation test: story collapses if Elara retains smell.</comment>
