<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interior oscillates between yearning and paralyzing silence; embodied reactions (clutching the lens, retreating into damp night) align with motives. The final micro-offering of the box + lens crystallizes an earned renunciation of withheld honesty and forces Lena to receive/return silence transformed. No therapy-speak, misbeliefs corrected only on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Holds Accumulative/Textural lens: each ticket-delivery escalates pattern density until the doodle itself is literally etched on stone, tightening stakes from private code to public confession. Closure—transfer of lens+box under the moon—is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights prior silences; cost felt in immediate shared vulnerability. No loops or scaffold obscuring chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Granite forecourt “crystal whispering” returns charged with moonlight in the final tableau; the lens and wet charcoal ground the same micro-space into decision ground. Every sensory choice (wet jasmine, damp sleeve) narrows POV and heightens intimacy. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust—receives single but clear intensification: ritual ticket → cenotaph confrontation → final offering. Price is the loss of passive surveillance privilege as Elias steps from desk to park. No lucky off-stage fixes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from motif evolution: private symbols → public wound → shared silence reframed. Final image reconfigures prior grief without stating it. “Key of broken wings” repurposed from accusation to mutual offering is the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person interior close in Elias’s hushed register; lens texture and tick tick tick of lobby clock function as rhythmic leitmotif. Purposeful uncertainty about Lena’s inner life taught early. No POV slippage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compression without purple: “heavy glass magnified the cryptic doodle into something he could almost understand.” Variation of syntax under pressure—short staccato beats during park walk against longer reflective cadences. Zero loops, zero filter stacks. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crypt-doodle as non-verbal grief ritual avoids familiar template; silence used as plot architecture, not mood default. Risk distinction +0.3 for public cenotaph graffiti as climax. No derivations of famous lines.</comment>
