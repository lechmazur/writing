<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—scholarly caution vs. reckless love—are embodied in the moon-quartz ink and the trembling hand. The micro-choice to add the personal regret clause crystallizes his hierarchy of values and carries visible cost (emptied ink, drained blood). Elara’s silent arrival supplies external pressure that forces a relational shift. The final hand-reach earns its poise because every prior beat has bound Kaelen to irrevocable stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each glyph is a vow linked to the next, so the final loop is a because/therefore culmination. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s tentative hand-reach reweights the entire silence. Cost is legible in the near-empty ink well and the spent moon-quartz. No orientation drift; archive, moonbeam, and vellum are anchored by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive’s dust-mote constellations and single moonbeam narrow perception to Kaelen’s laser focus. The glass ink well evolves from gift to blood-binder, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean: desk corner, vellum, door silhouette track without drift. Micro-setting (ink well as charged object) fulfills the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore trust or lose Elara—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each promise-glyph tightens the noose of consequence until the final lattice leaves no retreat. The cost is the spent ink and the irreversible exposure of inner silence. One decisive tightening suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between language as control and love as surrender. The “symphony of truth” reframes confession not as argument but as holistic vulnerability. Final image—Elara reaching past the light to his hand—offers a non-literal answer: truth is embodied, not spoken. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the fragile chord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is precise, tactile, slightly fevered. Syntax tightens under pressure—“his breath held tight,” “frantic beating of his heart.” No head-hopping; Elara’s interiority is inferred only through gesture. Distinct texture in phrases like “cathedral-quiet” and “luminous harmony.”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold; “dust motes danced like constellations” is earned, not ornamental. Rhythm modulates with tension—long sentences for mapping, staccato for the final strokes. Zero artifacts in peak beats; closure image is crystal-clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magical linguistics as relational surgery. The “symphony of truth” trope is transformed into a visceral blood-and-moon-quartz ritual. Risky modification to Proto-Aenic grammar pays off in earned poise. Specificity of the ink well’s evolution prevents generic substitution.</comment>
