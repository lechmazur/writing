<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is precise and embodied; his “fluidly logical” mind is dramatized through the quiet cataloguing of micro-sounds. The passenger’s arc from panic to ease is credibly paced, but her shift feels slightly smoothed—no contradictory impulse lingers to complicate the closure. The cost to Elian is only the familiar solitude, so the renunciation is present yet thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the passenger’s newfound ease and Elian’s return to solitude reconfigure the stakes of silence without resolving them. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each named sound layers density until the hush becomes inhabitable. Cost is legible in the final image of Elian “savoring the familiar, comforting quiet,” a solitude he must keep re-earning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism terraces, Aether, and storm glass are rendered with selective sensory precision; the storm glass in particular constrains choice when Elian uses it to anchor the passenger’s attention. Spatial choreography is clean; the gondola’s glide and the dock’s shimmer track logically. One minor slip: “ghost of the train” is evocative but untethered to any physical cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the passenger be claimed by silence or learn to inhabit it—tightens through Elian’s guided micro-listening exercises. Escalation is incremental and textural rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost is the passenger’s relinquished noise-shield and Elian’s perpetual return to solitude; both are legible but lightly felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as an architecture one must learn to occupy rather than fear. The final image of Elian waiting in “sacred silence” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—the unclenching hands, the softened voice—carries more than dialogue. No thematic drift; every detail serves the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the hush it describes. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elian notices pressure in crystals and light on prism edges. No POV leakage; the passenger’s interiority is shown through bodily cues only. Syntax modulates gracefully between long gliding sentences and short, quiet pulses.</comment>

<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulting hush,” “cathedral of peace”) is earned by context and pattern. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—ferrying souls through literalized silence—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes of the ferryman and the spiritual guide are transformed through sensory specificity and the storm-glass mechanic. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure; it pays off in the resonant final image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
