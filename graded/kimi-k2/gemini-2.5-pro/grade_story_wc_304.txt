<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (reverence vs. detachment) surface in the micro-choice to tighten her grip on the emerald. The final renunciation—letting the soul vanish while preserving its spark—carries visible cost in the gentling aurora. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation remains singular and intensifies to the last beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emerald’s glow reconfigures the grotto’s silence into a charged archive of lost light. Causal chain—search, isolate, infuse, secure—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat deepens pattern density. Orientation anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto and aurora are not backdrop; the aurora’s static is the literal resource Elara mines, constraining her method and timing. Micro-setting of obsidian slab and velvet alcove track state changes. Sensory hierarchy (cool gem, liquid light) filters through POV priorities. Final image reweights the grotto from workshop to reliquary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage one irreplaceable memory before oblivion—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is a single deepening: the joy-note is found, extracted, and paid for by the soul’s extinction. Cost is legible in the aurora’s softening waltz. No external reversals needed; pressure is existential and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of preservation versus surrender emerges through action: the act of bottling light questions whether memory rescues or replaces life. Subtext in the locket’s lotus shape hints at rebirth without stating it. Final image offers non-literal answer—thousand sparks in darkness—reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature in “felt its vibrations against her consciousness” teaches the pattern early. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths during search, clipped pulse at infusion. No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression (“liquid light”) is taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or beat. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during infusion—“current of warmth and gold”—then settles into reverent hush. Opening and closing lines frame stakes and resonance cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of a mortician for souls is fresh; execution grounds it in tactile process. Aurora-as-data-stream transforms familiar cosmic light into harvestable static. Lotus locket reprises without cliché. Risk in lyric mode pays off: closure remains legible and charged.</comment>
