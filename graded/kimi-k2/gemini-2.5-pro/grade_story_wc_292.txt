<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s idealism and ancestral guilt are embodied in tactile micro-choices (thumb on nail, trembling hand at rock). The copper nail’s evolution from memento to key crystallizes his contradictory impulses—honor vs. dread—under rising pressure. Final decision to broadcast carries visible social cost. Minor slip: “nervously confident” is asserted more than dramatized until the drone launch.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (find journals → decode → drone → rock → broadcast) tightens options with clear because/therefore linkage. Closure is a decisive change—Elias reverses ancestral erasure on-air—costing his anonymity and safety. No orientation drift; all props tracked. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Far North station’s damp dread and basalt “weeping rock” are filtered through Elias’s weather-trained perception; micro-vortex and lichen patterns constrain navigation and decoding. The copper nail’s indentation in rock is a micro-setting that literally unlocks truth. Weather data is specific, never touristy. Could edge higher if storm had bitten his skin or drone harder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore ancestor’s erased discovery—tightens when each stanza narrows coordinates. Micro-vortex threat and Guild’s historical erasure raise cost; final broadcast forecloses retreat. One meaningful deepening suffices. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth vs. sanctioned history emerges through maps, weather, and copper key—never stated. Final image of “air beginning to dry” reweights the station’s oppressive dread into liberated purpose without moralizing. Subtext in coded verse and Guild silence is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s weather-librarian idiom: “salt-tongue licks the stone,” “sky-river’s child.” Rhythm tightens under pressure—short clauses mirror heartbeat at drone launch. No head-hopping; free indirect style clean. One POV drift: “he felt the dread thicken” could be sharper via body.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, propulsive; each sentence layers map lore or atmospheric data without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“cartographical curse”) fits librarian POV. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile as cartographical curse is fresh; combines climate-science alt-history with magical map erasure. Copper nail as biometric key to ancestral truth feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky synthesis pays off: Guild’s resource panic grounds the fantastical in plausible geopolitics.</comment>
