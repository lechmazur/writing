<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—archival duty vs. moral revulsion—is dramatized in concrete micro-choices (the trembling fingers, the bypass of main servers). The final act of betrayal is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the “pang of profound betrayal.” Minor slip: “bravely conflicted” is label-speak that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of letter → vertigo → bypass → encryption → release. Closure is a decisive change (packet gone) with felt cost (“heavier with the weight of what was to come”). One transition (descent to substructure) is clean. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frost-rimmed vaults, “echoing library under snow,” and archaic terminal all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Weather and architecture mirror Elara’s isolation and secrecy. Detail is selective and POV-filtered; no static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. stability—tightens once: the letter’s release forecloses any return to innocence. Escalation is causal and irreversible. Cost is legible in the betrayal pang and the “blank page” awaiting violent inscription. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of institutional myth vs. human fallibility emerges organically from the letter and Elara’s choice. Final image of snow as “blank page” offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the “ghost in the machine” ventilation and “pristine” history is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, textured, and POV-bound: “ghost in the machine,” “frost-rimmed data-vaults,” “cryo-pumps suddenly feeling like a scream.” No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compression and rhythm serve pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor loop: “dizzying quiet” appears twice in similar phrasing. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopian archive trope is refreshed by the cryogenic Founders and the liaison letter as contraband truth. The dormant-network hack via pre-Unification terminal is a fresh, grounded detail. Synthesis feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
