<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s grief is embodied in tactile ritual—polishing the gem, folding the crane—so motive stays legible. Interior contradiction surfaces when the dream’s promise collides with its impossibility, forcing a credible shift from drowning to current-riding. The cost is the forever-broken future he must still carry; this renunciation is earned and felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each upward step deepens memory-density until the basilica reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief becomes workable current—paid for by the visible ache of the unlived future. No orientation drift; causality of ascent/descent paradox is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating archipelago physics, glass basilica refraction, and gem dust starlight are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain movement and charge the final image. The tea garden returns as reweighted memory-space, grounding the dream’s promise in a place once unbearable now bearable. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape grief or be consumed—tightens through each mnemonic wave. The polishing ritual is the escalating micro-choice that converts raw sorrow into workable form; cost is the reopened wound of the dream’s promise. One clear deepening suffices; no external reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief as craftable but unfinishable material emerges through action, not statement. The dream’s quiet domestic future reweights every prior lantern skeleton; the final crane embodies acceptance without redemption. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of wings that will not fly yet exist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression—“luminous torment,” “powdered starlight”—that never drifts into purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen notices textures, weights, refractions that mirror his inner state. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; free-indirect texture is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—“grief a formless, heavy water”—and serve the emotional arc. No overwriting in peak beats; clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The mnemonic-gem pilgrimage through inverted gravity feels fresh yet inevitable; tropes of grief-ritual and floating islands are transformed by the specificity of lantern craft and gem polishing. The final crane folds grief into hope without sentimentality, a synthesis that could not survive relocation to another setting.</comment>
