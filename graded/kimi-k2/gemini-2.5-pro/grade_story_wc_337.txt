<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>MC's vocation of “restorer of broken masks” is beautifully embodied in the meticulous unraveling of knots; interiority is concrete, sensory, and contradictory (fear vs duty). The mentor/apprentice dynamic remains largely status-stabilized—Kaelen is a witness more than pressure—so relationship-as-crucible is only lightly felt. The final hand-off of the needle gives a micro-turn that crystallizes inheriting responsibility; cost is subtle but legible (trembling hand).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens: each knot’s loosening directly grounds a spirit and re-strengthens the sanctuary’s hush (cause → effect). Orientation is anchored early; no prop drift. Closure lands with a Charged Poise: Kaelen poised with the needle and “our night had just begun.” Felt cost: the elder’s exhaustion and the open-ended admission that thousands remain—path not foreclosed, merely sharpened.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Crystalline chamber, star-scattered floor, and the salt-darkened net operate as tactile, pressure-bearing environment; the net literally constrains tactics and bears the spirits. One detail—bone-white tapestry needle catching starlight—recurs and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Atmospheric specifics mirror internal anxiety without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding restless spirits) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening: each unraveling both heals and re-strengthens the sanctuary hush—escalation under causal lens. Cost is cumulative exhaustion, visible in the elder’s drained state and the admission that thousands remain. The final scene crystallizes that the pressure will not merely fade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—careful tending of collective memory and silence—emerges organically through the act of un-knotting rather than statement. The silence “accumulates” and is shown to be fragile, requiring continuous labor. Final resonance: the apprentice now holds the needle and the story keeps echoing because the task is endless, not moralized.</comment>

<comment>Voice is sustained, specific, perceptual (“felt like a shroud,” “caught a sliver of starlight”). Diction slightly elevated yet consistent with a restorer’s precision. No POV leakage; psychic distance stable. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and indistinct between speakers—only modest flaw, as apprentice is observer, not voice foil.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High information density: verbs punch, no loops, no boilerplate. Imagery is precise without purple drift. Line rhythm mirrors tension—longer sensory lines in calm, staccato during un-knotting. Only micro-slip: “we now shared […] like a shroud” is slightly thematic-label but forgiven in context.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: net as spiritual capacitor, tapestry needle as surgical soul suture, prism sanctuary as tuning fork are internally consistent and specific. Avoids cliché metaphors by grounding them in concrete action. The inheritor hand-off feels inevitable, not quirky twist, giving a restrained +0.2 for ingenuity.</comment>
