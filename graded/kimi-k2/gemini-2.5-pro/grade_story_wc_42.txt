<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s lifelong ache and the photograph-lens anchor his sacrifice; the contradiction between “harness the ephemeral” and freezing time is embodied in the decisive act. Interiority is spare but specific—“gnarled fingers,” “luminous ache”—and the final stillness carries felt cost. Secondary pressure from Hima is minimal but sufficient to crystallize stakes. The choice to sacrifice the irreplaceable lens earns the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock hand freezes at lunar zenith, anchoring the station outside time. Causal chain—spinning hand → lens insertion → absolute stillness—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation. Cost is legible in the “beautiful, silent prison” line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cupola workshop, brass chronometer, and moon portal are vivid and selective; the lens itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final fix. Spatial choreography is clean; the crack in the portal glass tracks escalating pressure. Environment guides choice: lunar gravity drives the resonance, the lens counters it.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—station survival—tightens through the accelerating hand. One decisive tightening: Elias’s restructure gambit forecloses continued time-flow. Agency is clear; cost is the frozen future. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of permanence versus transience emerges through the lens sacrifice; no direct statement. Final image of the motionless hand pointing at the moon reweights the premise—time itself is the price. Subtext in Elias’s ache remains unspoken yet legible.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“bruised clouds,” “diamond-dust stars”—and remains in Elias’s perceptual register. Syntax modulates with tension; short declaratives under stress. No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates with the spinning hand, then snaps to stillness. Opening and closing lines are strong and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Combines clockwork cosmology with intimate grief in a fresh synthesis. The lens-as-heart conceit transforms a familiar “save the station” arc into a meditation on memory and loss. Specificity of lunar gravity harmonics and camera optics grounds the speculative element.</comment>
