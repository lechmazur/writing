<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—professional detachment vs. visceral empathy—surface in the tactile worry of the coral and the deliberate quietness he cultivates; the micro-choice to translate the cast rather than exploit it crystallizes his values and visibly costs him emotional composure, earning the General’s flicker of humanity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each decoded symbol thickens the pattern of shared loss until the final image reweights the premise—peace is not a treaty but a father hearing his own fear in a child’s whisper. Closure lands as Charged Poise; the cost is the translator’s relinquishing of strategic leverage for raw human recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: its sterile stillness contrasts with the humid valley, and the glass walls literalize the fragile membrane between warring sides. The coral fragment reappears as tactile memory, constraining Elias’s decision to translate rather than weaponize the child’s code.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging two hardened hearts—tightens when each decoded symbol strips abstraction from grief. The meaningful turn occurs when Elias chooses to speak the child’s fear aloud, trading tactical silence for human contact; the cost is the General’s loss of command distance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: shared vulnerability as the only true lingua franca. The subtext—father and translator both flinch at thunder—carries the weight without sermon. The final image reconfigures the conflict’s scale from geopolitical to domestic, leaving moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elias’s selective perception; the prose’s low, hushed cadence mirrors his deliberate calm. Distinctive diction—“lotus-hearted ache,” “pitted, convoluted fragment”—signals his translator’s precision and coastal memory without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and texture, accelerating slightly during decoding beats. No loops or scaffold; each image does double duty (“thick mist,” “hiss of the generator”). Occasional elevated phrasing is voice-consistent and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conceit—child’s cast as peace treaty—feels inevitable yet fresh, transforming a familiar trope of coded messages into an intimate lexicon of fear and longing. Specificity of graphite smudges and honey-cakes grounds the invention in lived detail.</comment>
