<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the layering ritual and the poison-label anchor contradictory impulses. Motivation—"to discover the texture of memories"—drives every beat. The final renunciation (waiting for the next tide) is earned and carries visible cost: the layered memory dissolves, leaving only the tin box. No second on-page character, so relationship bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Charged Poise: the composite memory coalesces then disperses with the horn blast, reweighting the premise. Causality is lyric but legible—each tide delivers fragments that the protagonist layers until the final image crystallizes the cost. Orientation is immediate; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Port-container labyrinth is tactile, brine-soaked, diesel-laced; every sensory choice filters through the ghost’s perceptual bias. The Evergreen container thins to a “translucent membrane” under pressure, constraining the layering ritual and charging the final image. Micro-setting (poison label) doubles as anchor and constraint. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can a patchwork memory substitute for an erased past? Escalation is textural—each incoming tide adds density until the composite memory briefly becomes “mine,” then the horn blast severs it. Cost is palpable: the memory’s dissolution. Agency remains with the ghost’s layering; coincidence (woman’s grief) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ghost’s attempt to counterfeit identity from borrowed grief and wonder. Subtext lives in gesture—the careful placement of the label back into the tin box is a quiet funeral for a self that never was. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “that is a kind of living.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, salt-etched, and rhythmically controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through rust-holes and diesel haze. Compression and elision (“the world arrives in steel boxes”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so mechanics are moot. POV remains stable and modest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sensory specificity (“green-bearded pylons,” “phantom history”) advances atmosphere without overwriting. Final cadence slows to mirror the tide’s retreat, earning the quiet last line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost assembling identity from overheard fragments in a port container city—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes of namelessness and erased past are transformed through tactile ritual and tidal rhythm. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
