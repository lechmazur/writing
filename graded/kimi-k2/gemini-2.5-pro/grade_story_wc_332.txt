<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “heart hammered against his ribs” at the prismatic fog—but the contradiction between obsessive pursuit and quiet contentment at the end is asserted more than dramatized; still, the final renunciation of further chase carries a felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous presence coalesces, reweighting the premise from absence to living glow; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each sunrise fragment layers into the final tapestry, with the palette’s last well sealing the cost of years spent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The easternmost islet’s “stark, beautiful loneliness” and the library’s “scent of old paper and sea salt” are selective and POV-filtered; the palette itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act—without its wells the ending fails—meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the runaway dream—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the prismatic fog promises the “final piece,” forcing a last use of the palette’s single empty well; cost is the irrevocable filling of that well, foreclosing further pursuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of longing as light-code emerges through concrete ritual; the final image reweights absence into presence without moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer to the question of whether a dream can be reclaimed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control—“pearlescent glow of dawn, the sharp gold of the first direct ray”—and a consistent perceptual signature; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops or mixed metaphors; the final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the swirl of light, earning its lyric height.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of photography-as-cipher and palette-as-light-capture feels inevitable and fresh; the risk of literalizing a dream into living radiance pays off without gimmickry, transforming a familiar quest into luminous specificity.</comment>
