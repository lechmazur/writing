<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amal’s grief-driven obsession is embodied in every micro-choice—gripping the console, clutching the geode, feeding memory into equations. The interior contradiction (scientific detachment vs. raw mourning) is palpable and consistent. The final crystallized stance—coordinates in hand, grief now vectored—earns its cost from every prior beat. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “reservoir” of stolen potential is proven, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds—each beat because/therefore tightens toward the spike in the probability matrix. The ticking coolant clock supplies a felt constraint that shapes tactics. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orbital observatory is sketched with selective sensory economy—coolant hiss, viewport curve, console metal—each detail filtering through Amal’s urgency. The geode functions as micro-setting/object that constrains her final choice by focusing grief into trajectory. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment subtly guides choice via overheating array and limited window.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the reservoir of stolen potential—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates under causal pressure. The tightening beat is the spike in the quantum foam that forecloses doubt and forces the final stance. Cost is visible: the grief remains a “cold, dense star” now aimed. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cosmic theft of unrealized futures. No moralizing; the final coordinates reweight the premise without exposition. Subtext hums in the geode’s silent chord and the “music that would never be played.” Resonance lingers in the reader’s after-image of a wound mapped and weaponized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, scientifically precise yet emotionally scalding. Syntax mirrors Amal’s hyper-focused state: long tensor sentences collapse into stark fragments under pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains locked. The diction stays within a physicist’s lexicon without slipping into jargon for its own sake.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—“deathwatch beetle,” “cold dense star”—and never muddle causality. No loops or scaffold; information is layered efficiently. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moment) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum grief-hunt is fresh and inevitable: treating a drone strike as a perturbation in spacetime’s potential field. Risk is high—hard-SF lyricism could have collapsed into gimmickry—but the emotional specificity anchors it. The geode-as-lens and the “unused potential” concept are non-obvious yet fully integrated. Transformation test passes: story would collapse if any element were generic.</comment>
