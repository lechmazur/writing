<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s longing is embodied in his fluid motion and the whalebone’s weight; Elara’s “combative tenderness” is dramatized in stance and plea. The final renunciation—Kaelen stepping onto the rising island while Elara stays—carries a palpable relational cost. Interior contradiction (cage vs. home) is active in scene, not summary. Minor slip: “nature isn’t here” edges toward label-speak but is quickly grounded in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Kaelen listens to the scrimshaw, therefore the island answers. Closure is a decisive change—Aethelburg rises and drifts, severing land ties—felt in Elara’s “aching acceptance” and Kaelen’s refusal to look back. Orientation is swift; stakes and geography are anchored within 120 words. No causal hiccups.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt-crusted shed, splintered docks, and petrified roots are vivid, selective, and tied to action. The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Final image—waterfalls of brine and mossy stone—recharges the motif. One minor spatial vagueness: “waist-deep in the surf” vs. “water at his chest” could track cleaner.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom vs. home—tightens when Elara’s plea fails and Kaelen detaches the island. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options until only departure remains. Cost is visible: Elara’s loss, Kaelen’s exile. No coincidence resolves the turn; the whale’s call is earned by prior longing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of freedom vs. belonging emerges through concrete choices, not statement. The scrimshaw’s reprise at the end reweights the dream from myth to lived reality. Final image offers resonant non-moral answer: drift toward open sea. Avoids sermon; ambiguity lingers in Elara’s silent surf.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet tactile—“fluid economy of motion,” “combativeness had washed away.” Syntax modulates with pressure; short clauses accelerate the rising. No head-hopping; POV stays with Kaelen except for one brief, earned dip into Elara’s chest warmth. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, propulsive, and clean. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is purposeful—“waterfalls of brine,” “primeval blossoms”—and never muddles. Rhythm breathes with beats. One near-repeat of “water” could trim, but it doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest trope is transformed through embodied labor, tactile magic, and sibling crucible. Whale-call as activation mechanism feels fresh yet inevitable. Specificity of dock work and bone carving grounds the myth. Risky quiet ending lands with earned cost.</comment>
