<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“walls weep history,” “candlelight flickers against blue, million-year-old cold”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the decisive act of weaving truth is dramatized more as ritual than as a charged micro-choice with visible cost. The boy’s smile and the man’s dissolution feel earned, yet Elara’s own flaw or renunciation is only implied, keeping her arc just shy of the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the boy’s release and the man’s unmasking reconfigure meaning with undeniable cost (the melted globe becomes a memorial, not a prison). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned dream cameos tighten until the shared dreamscape crystallizes the stakes. No causality breaks; every beat advances knowledge or pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shrine’s ice, candlelight, and globe are not backdrop but active constraints: the cold preserves memory, the candle’s breath mirrors trance depth, the globe’s distortion anchors the quest. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“blue, million-year-old cold” felt on skin). Final image recharges the shrine and globe, meeting the 9-gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvaging a pure truth from the wreckage—tightens through each dream cameo until the shared dream forces the man’s confession and the boy’s release. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (deepening trance, weaving images). Cost is legible: the globe remains broken, the vigil eternal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory as prison versus memorial; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in the man’s “carefully constructed excuse” and the boy’s silent smile. Final image of the broken-yet-liberated globe offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of witnessing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“walls weep history,” “human eclipse”). POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“borrowed starlight”) are taught early and paid off in the final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere, stakes, or sensory detail. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor elevation in diction (“conceptual repricing,” “psychic theater”) stays within Elara’s esoteric lexicon and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The “wreck-diver of frozen souls” premise is fresh, synthesized through specific dream-harvest mechanics and the charged snow-globe anchor. Transformation test: swap globe for any generic object and the emotional arc collapses. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
