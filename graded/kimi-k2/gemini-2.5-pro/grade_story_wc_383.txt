<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interior contradiction—skeptic vs. longing—drives every beat; the embodied ache of “her presence so vivid it was an ache” anchors emotion. Micro-choice to push harder against the spire crystallizes values at cost. Minor slip: “ghostly resolve” leans label-speak mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each “because” tightens options until the final surge archives memory, reconfiguring identity. Closure lands with felt cost—“a single tear…for the wholeness he had finally won.” No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garden’s velvet dusk and crystal spires constrain movement and supply the resonance interface; the seashell’s cool curve becomes micro-setting that charges the final silence. Selective sensory detail—“moss that muffled his footsteps”—serves mood and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—escalates as memory’s pain rises; the last-star deadline sharpens the final push. Agency drives every turn; cost is visible in the tear and the shell’s silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ownership-through-pain emerges from the specific memory of Lyra; no moralizing, only the reweighted shell and tear. Final image reconfigures “independence” from void to integrated loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded in Elian’s skepticism; perceptual signature vivid (“sky the color of a deep bruise”). No head-hop; compression in final surge mirrors stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; rhythm modulates with tension. Minor filter-verb haze (“he felt the ghost”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Final line earns cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tech and grief; resonance structures and quarantined memory feel inevitable, not gimmick. Risk in lyric compression pays off in closure image.</comment>
