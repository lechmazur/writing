<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Xylar’s inherited sorrow and refusal to perpetuate cosmic erasure are embodied in every micro-choice; the shift from mapping sorrow to broadcasting love is a credible renunciation that costs the ancestral path. Interiority stays concrete, never lapsing into label-speak. The single flaw: the gear’s emotional weight is asserted more than dramatized in Xylar’s body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of empathic broadcasting becomes the new “light,” foreclosing the old cycle with visible conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ping layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation drift; the nebula’s rules remain consistent. Only the ancestor’s failure is summarized, not dramatized, a minor ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden is never mere backdrop; its “troubling serenity” modulates with Xylar’s stance, and the final blooming is charged by the setting itself. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The gear’s impossible solidity against the garden’s physics subtly constrains Xylar’s realization. One hairline slip: “dust of ancient light-motes” edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—break the cycle of sacrificial renewal—is signaled early and tightened when Xylar re-tools the pings from query to gift. The cost is the abandonment of the ancestral computational path, paid on the page. Escalation is a single deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Pressure stays coherent and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: light as emission, not resource, discovered through the very act of empathetic search. The gear’s failure reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of the garden “beginning to bloom” offers a non-literal, earned answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; patterned elision (“slow transit…quiet sigh”) is taught early and paid off in the blooming cadence. Perceptual signature is consistent—Xylar’s noticing is filtered through inherited sorrow and cosmic scale. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image or stakes. Occasional figurative flourish (“ghosts of every ancestor in the dust”) is earned by context. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One filter-verb cluster (“feeling the ghost of its creator’s logic”) is minor and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic husbandry, empathic sonar, and ancestral computational failure feels inevitable and fresh. The gear is not a gimmick but a conceptual pivot. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
