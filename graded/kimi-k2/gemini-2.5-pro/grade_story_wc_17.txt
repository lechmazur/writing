<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet, embodied curiosity (“to discover what walls dream about”) is consistent and specific, but her final renunciation—leaving the diaries in the hearth—reads more as professional protocol than a crucible of contradictory impulse; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in her body.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens the burden until the final “burden of knowing” waveform crystallizes the stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise that reconfigures Elara’s stance without forcing external action; the cost is the knowledge she now carries silently away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and soot-scored hearth are vivid, selective, and tethered to Elara’s perception; the fireplace itself constrains her final choice by serving as the proper tomb for the diaries, charging the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the legacy’s burden of guilt—tightens through each scorched page; the discovery of Prometheus reframes the stakes from mere failure to active harm, forcing Elara’s renunciation. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited complicity emerges organically from the diaries’ fragments and Elara’s refusal to absolve or expose; the final waveform notation offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to what walls “dream.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to acoustic memory; compression (“the stones ache”) and sensory hierarchy remain consistent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the final sentence lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” conceit is fresh and fully integrated; the diaries-as-ashes device transforms familiar climate-guilt into a tactile haunting. Specificity of the Prometheus formula gives the concept durable originality.</comment>
