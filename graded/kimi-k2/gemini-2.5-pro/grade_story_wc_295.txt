<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian’s generational obsession and tactile rituals (telegram, eyepiece) anchor motivation; the embodied tremor when writing the final translation shows earned cost. Interior contradiction—duty to decode vs. acceptance of un-decodable grief—plays out in real time. Micro-choice to surrender to dream-witness rather than control it crystallizes values. Still, secondary pressure from absent grandfather remains off-page, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds; causal chain (telegram clue → star map → dream → translation) is tight. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “burden no longer his alone” reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the trembling hands and dawn exhaustion. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Observatory dome, cold eyepiece, and brittle telegram act as micro-settings that constrain choices—equipment dictates method, telegram limits hope. Sensory selectivity (dust scent, copper chill) mirrors emotional narrowing under pressure. Final sunrise reconfigures the stakes from nocturnal obsession to shared daylight witness. Spatial choreography clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode or accept the temple’s grief—tightens once the dream reveals the glyphs are lament, not puzzle. Escalation is accretive: each stellar pulse adds semantic weight until renunciation of decoding becomes inevitable. Visible cost: dawn exhaustion and relinquished certainty. Agency resides in the choice to witness rather than solve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of shared sorrow emerges from the star-grammar without exposition; telegram’s phrase reweights from curse to communal promise. Subtext in the shift from “decode” to “translate grief” carries moral nuance. Final image—telegram as promise—offers resonant non-moral answer. No thematic drift or late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent lyric-scientific: “celestial heartbeat,” “glowing ideograms.” Perceptual signature filters cosmos through epistemic desire. Syntax modulates with pressure—long sentences for descent, fragments at gasp-awake. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Dialogue absent by design, not flaw.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers image and concept (“shimmering motes of light,” “cosmic loneliness”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—RR Lyrae as verb, companions as adjectives. Rhythm accelerates during dream collapse, slows at dawn calm. Minor elevated diction (“inscriptions materialized”) fits POV’s scholarly register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of lucid dreaming, stellar linguistics, and archaeological grief feels fresh yet inevitable. Variable-star syntax as language is non-obvious and fully committed. Transformation test: swapping elements would collapse premise. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
