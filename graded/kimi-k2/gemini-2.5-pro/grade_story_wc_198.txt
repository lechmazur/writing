<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied—cold brass anchor, dread clench—yet the inherited duty remains abstract; the “scent of rain” cue is evocative but doesn’t tilt a present micro-choice. His lone action (playing negative space) is consistent and costly, but the contradiction between nostalgia and duty is stated more than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the prophecy is hushed, the silence restored, and the cost—the solitary, endless vigil—is felt in the final image of perfect dewdrops. Causal chain holds: coded drips → saxophone counter-melody → prism vibration → silence regained. No orientation debt; grotto entry anchors by ~90 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s blue-green fungi light and prism atrium are not backdrop; they vibrate under saxophone pressure, bending light to starve the prophecy of resonance. Dewdrops at entrance return reweighted—now “tiny, shimmering worlds” that embody the restored hush. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Elias’s professional attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy from becoming syntax—is signaled early and tightened once: the coded drips falter under deliberate musical starvation. Cost is visible in the final solitude and eerie nostalgia. Agency is Elias’s continuous act; no external coincidence resolves the threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation-through-erasure emerges from action: music frames silence, memory is protected by forgetting prophecy. Final image of perfect dewdrops offers non-literal resonance—peace bought by endless, lonely vigil—without moralizing. Subtext lives in the prism’s silent rainbows now stilled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“stone teeth,” “mother-of-pearl keys”—with rhythmic control that breathes with scene pressure. No dialogue; internal focalization stays consistent. Patterned elision (negative space) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“vested hush,” “fractured light”) is earned by the mythic register. Final paragraph slows cadence to crystallize cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fog-bound saxophonist who silences coded prophecy by playing absence is a fresh synthesis; the prism atrium as acoustic diffraction engine is specific and non-obvious. Risky negative-space method is fully integrated, not gimmick. Transformation test: story collapses if any core element is swapped.</comment>
