<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is embodied—bone-listening, cold knees, thumb-pressed stillness—so motives feel lived. The contradiction between urgent world fear and his enforced stillness sharpens the final cost: he gives away his own calm to anchor a stranger. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation is clear, rooted, and visibly paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map’s ignition reconfigures both the child’s options and Kaelen’s endless vigil. Causal lens holds—each step (listen → pattern → pour → seal → release) is a because/therefore chain. Cost is explicit in the final sentence: he “sinks back to the ground,” calm spent. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The withered orchard, frozen soil, and rust flakes are not backdrop; they supply the literal material for the map and mirror Kaelen’s stripped persistence. Micro-setting (crater rim, brittle twigs) constrains posture and tool use. Sensory selection is urgent—cold ozone, bruised twilight—filtering through Kaelen’s marrow-listening. Environment charges the final image as he turns back into its silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: translate a child’s terror into safe passage. Pressure tightens once—from frantic pulse to steady beacon—via Kaelen’s irreversible expenditure of personal stillness. No external antagonist; the conflict is internal scarcity of calm versus infinite need. Escalation is causal under the lens: each alchemic step narrows options until the final ignition forecloses Kaelen’s rest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: empathy as alchemy that transmutes fear into guidance, at the cost of the empath’s own stillness. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb pressed to paper, knees cracking—rather than statement. Final image reweights the orchard from desolation to renewable resource of sacrifice. No moralizing; resonance is felt in the hush after the flash.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “resonant marrow of his bones,” “safekept starlight smelled of cold ozone.” Syntax lengthens during listening, compresses during ignition, mirroring pulse. No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Patterned elision (“the world held its breath”) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but never purple; each image performs double duty—rust flakes as map material and decay emblem. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor risk (“glowing capillaries”) but context justifies biological light. Final sentence lands clean, no artifacts. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—heartbeat cartography via starlight alchemy—is non-obvious yet fully realized through tactile process. Transformation test fails if relocated: the orchard’s detritus, crater cold, and marrow-listening are inseparable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight, yet fresh.</comment>
