<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the vial and scent anchor contradictory impulses (seeking vs. fearing memory). The final beat—choosing to inhale the grief—earns its cost through prior sensory caution and the revealed link to Elara. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not tested. Micro-choice at climax is legible and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: scent density increases until the Moon-Phlox bloom releases the exact memory, reweighting Elias’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief becomes cleansing rather than weapon—felt on page. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Causality intact: UV reveal → word → recognition → acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse rendered through humid air, fractured light, and the UV apparatus; each detail filters Elias’s caution and frames the final bloom. The vial doubles as micro-setting that constrains the UV experiment. No spatial contradictions; sensory hierarchy (scent over sight) mirrors POV priority. Environment charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias confront or retreat from the scent-memory—signaled early. Escalation is the intensifying olfactory pressure culminating in the bloom; no external reversals needed. Cost is the irreversible flood of grief accepted in the final breath. Agency preserved throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s dual edge emerges through concrete olfactory triggers rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier sensory avoidance into acceptance; no moralizing. Subtext carried by the vial and the word “Somniflora.” Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric yet precise; perceptual signature favors scent and temperature over visual catalog. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments at climax. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged solely on internal texture. UV reveal pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language (“crystal shadows,” “constellation being born”) serves the moment without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Rhythm breathes with the slow bloom. Minor elevated diction fits Elias’s antique-trade lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinct flower as bottled memory, broker of light seeking shadow, UV cryptography between lovers. Tropes transformed through sensory specificity and scientific restraint. Risk in quiet bloom payoff is earned by prior scent dread. No derivative echoes.</comment>
