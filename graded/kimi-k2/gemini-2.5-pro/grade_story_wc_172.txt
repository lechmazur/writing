<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—ruthless water baron vs. haunted dreamer—are dramatized in the trembling hand that both signs death warrants and cradles the egg. The final renunciation is earned by the memory of birdsong that has silently driven every prior desiccation. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids diagnostic labels. Only the “secretly sentimental” tag edges toward label-speak, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s dissolution reweights the entire drought-ravaged world into a living grave/genesis. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer tightens the emotional cost until the final bloom of color in brine. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the “quiet, hollow resonance” that answers the lifelong echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but crucible: crystalline bite on knees, sulfurous vent that dissolves the egg, thunder promising rain that is both triumph and curse. Micro-setting (egg, brine, knees) constrains the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Only a touch of scenic grandeur edges toward postcard, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to preserve or surrender the last echo—tightens once, irrevocably, when the shell dissolves. Pressure is Accumulative: silence, heat, and memory accrue until the act forecloses resurrection. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Cost is visible in the hollow resonance and the coming rain that will salt the wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: extinction as both crime and elegy, grace possible only through self-erasure. Subtext lives in the egg’s ember-speckles swirling into microbial soup. Final image reweights every prior desiccation without moralizing. Complexity lingers—no redemption, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and POV-locked: “mineral ghost of the ocean,” “calligraphy of cracks.” Rhythm modulates with heat and memory. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the silent bloom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Metaphors are precise—“library of song unwritten.” No loops or scaffold. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) is voice-motivated. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses eco-thriller and elegy into a fresh, compressed ritual. The drought-baron’s penance via egg-dissolution is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of salt, vent, and shell makes the concept unrepeatable. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
