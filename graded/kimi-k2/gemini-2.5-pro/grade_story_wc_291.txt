<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s prosopagnosia and artistic compulsion are embodied in every micro-choice; the final scratch is earned by the ritualized process. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The ache at the end is a credible cost, though the shift from selfish quest to felt sorrow could be even sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each layer of paint and mist thickens the emotional density until the violent scratch reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canvas and quarry mirror each other with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quarry’s cold geometry and mutable fog actively constrain Elias’s ritual; the ribbon’s silk against stone is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One minor slip: “damp sigh of the wind” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening empathy—is signaled early and tightened by each stroke; the scratch forecloses the option of remaining emotionally numb. Pressure grows via density, not external reversals. Cost is legible in the shuddering breath and fragile ache.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of absence-as-portrait emerges organically from the quarry void and the scratched canvas; no moralizing. The final image reweights the ribbon’s joy against granite despair without a word of summary. Subtext is carried in gesture and material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, and consistent; perceptual signature is evident in the synesthetic color choices. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences for ritual, staccato for the scratch. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and image-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or process. One paraphrase loop (“violence, the unmaking” / “permanent scar…transient soul”) costs −0.2. Otherwise, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors, no register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The conceit of painting a murder’s absence via prosopagnosia feels fresh and inevitable. The quarry-as-canvas and ribbon-as-last-ghost transform familiar noir tropes. Risky structural choice—no investigation, pure ritual—pays off in the final scratch.</comment>
