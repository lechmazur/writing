<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and character-specific; the narrator’s analytic detachment under pressure is embodied in micro-choices like “pulse steady.” The final renunciation—leaving the globe—earns its cost through prior causality. Mortimer’s silent presence, however, remains ornamental and never pressures choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the snow globe reweights the premise, and the narrator’s decision to leave it carries felt cost. Causal chain holds: discovery → note → physics insight → renunciation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift at the end tighten the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly anchored—bronze doors, drifting chairs, mahogany desk—and constrains the final choice: the globe must stay in its abyssal shrine. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV’s scientific priorities. Micro-setting (the strongbox fused by heat) charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens when the globe’s stasis reveals the cost of refusal. One meaningful tightening: the narrator’s decision to leave the anchor redefines options. Cost is conceptual but legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the father’s refusal and the narrator’s renunciation; no moralizing. The final image of the “gilded cage” reweights prior material without a stated thesis. Subtext operates in the silent tableau of the unmoving girl.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is calm, scientific, yet haunted; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression and patterned elision (“Mortimer, as I call him”) are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; diction stays within the narrator’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“esoteric,” “entropy”) fits the POV’s academic register. Closure image is unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—quantum sanctuary trapped in a snow globe aboard a sunken library—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Specific details (lead-lined strongbox fused by heat) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking (physics of grief as literal device) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
