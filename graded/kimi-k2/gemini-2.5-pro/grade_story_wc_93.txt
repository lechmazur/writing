<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—magnetic boots groaning, eels’ panic felt in his ribs—and the promise to Elara drives every beat. The contradictory pull between passive foresight and active intervention is embodied in the micro-choice to pour star dust. Cost is legible: the spiral and his years of work survive, yet the curse endures. One slip: “precognitively cursed” edges toward label-speak mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: vision → choice → harness → split tide. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Kael kneels, gravity warps, the bluff stands but the promise’s burden deepens. No orientation drift; anchors (basalt, aurora trigger) are clear by line 3. One causal ellipsis (how star dust circuit completes) is minor and taught by pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt, frictionless sea, and aurora are not backdrop; the bluff’s geometry and the tide’s momentum constrain every tactic. The obsidian shards and star-dust sphere function as micro-setting that literally bends physics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—aurora light “presses down” under stress. One hairline slip: “world that had long forgotten friction” is told, not shown, in the opener.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the spiral, keep the promise—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is causal: vision tightens, tide rises, choice narrows to star dust. Cost is visible: Kael’s slumped knees, eels’ panic, the unbroken curse. No extraneous reversals; one tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-with-chaos emerges from the spiral math and the tide’s deflection, never stated. Final image—aurora now “a tool he was finally beginning to understand”—reweights the borrowed dawn without moralizing. Subtext in the eels’ fractal panic mirrors Kael’s mind. Avoids tidy epiphany; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, elliptical, and consistent: “a thimbleful of night that warped the air.” Compression taught early (“lone anchor in a world that had long forgotten friction”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, image, and stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—“celestial river,” “gravitational eddy”—and never muddle causality. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” phrase is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: eel herder, prime-number sigils, and collapsed-star harness feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Premise commits fully to frictionless physics without exposition dumps. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes and clarity. No recognizable template echoes.</comment>
