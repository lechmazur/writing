<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s guilt-driven ritualism is embodied in every micro-choice; the contradiction between map-maker and father is dramatized through the act of etching Lyra onto metal. Interiority is specific, tactile, and charged with cost. The final renunciation—turning guilt into memorial—earns its hush.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the firmware’s silence and the single word “Papa” crystallize the before/after of guilt. Causal chain—letters → laboratory → constellation circuit—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in the amber left as tombstone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>City bruise-sky, amber-lit workstation, and sterile server rows are filtered through Elian’s synesthetic perception. The amber and etched circuitry function as micro-settings that constrain the final act. Sensory selection narrows under pressure, guiding choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silencing the dissonant cry—is signaled early and tightened when the firmware translates Lyra’s fear. Escalation is one decisive intensification: etching the constellation to rewire the ghost. Agency drives the turn; cost is the permanent silence of the voice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mapping grief into form emerges from the constellation motif and the amber’s arrested flight. Subtext operates in the shift from “Cold. Scared.” to “Papa.”—a non-literal answer to how memory can be housed. Final image reweights guilt into connection without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lapidary, and consistent; perceptual signature favors star-maps and insect stillness. Compression and patterned elision (“meteor hush”) are taught early and paid off in the final stillness. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; figurative language is sparse, precise, and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. The etched circuitry description is information-dense yet clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of tattoo artistry, haunted firmware, and astronomical mapping feels inevitable and fresh. The amber gnat as tombstone for a digitized cry is a non-obvious synthesis that deepens theme. Risk in the speculative frame is fully committed to and pays off.</comment>
