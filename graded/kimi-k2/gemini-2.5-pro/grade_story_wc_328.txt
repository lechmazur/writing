<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Julian’s bitterness-to-reverence arc is embodied in micro-choices (picking up, then setting down the arrowhead) and contradictory impulses (expose vs protect) that crystallize in the final beat. The sister-shaped hole in his motive stays palpable, but the shift from “monster” to “cosmic joke” lands cleanly. Minor: the “frostbitten hope” is named rather than embodied, a hairline slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (hovering droplets, static hiss, sapling birth) deepens the same stake until the final image reconfigures Julian’s mission. Closure is a Charged Poise—phone down, arrowhead left, path foreclosed—cost is the irreversible loss of the sister he wanted back. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden’s physics (droplets deciding direction) and bioluminescent orchid are not backdrop but active agents that enable the metamorphosis and constrain Julian’s final choice. Micro-setting (arrowhead warmth, moss texture) charges the last beat. No spatial drift; every detail either pressures choice or reappears in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove Elara monstrous”—tightens into “protect the sanctuary” via one decisive intensification: witnessing the man’s transformation. Escalation is accumulative density of wonder and cost rather than causal turns; the final refusal carries visible price (loss of vengeance and of old Clara). Sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief transmuted into rooted silence emerges from the man-to-sapling image and Julian’s renunciation; no explicit statement. The cosmic-joke insight is earned by the failed hunt for a villain. Final image (phone and arrowhead abandoned) offers non-literal answer: salvation may look like surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, slightly archaic, and consistent (“loam,” “knapped flint,” “electric snow”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through Julian’s covert gaze. Compression (“I watched from the shadows”) teaches elision early; payoff is the silent hand-off at the end. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “soil under her nails and the placid, unnerving silence of a forest after a fire” does triple duty. Rhythm modulates—long sentence for transformation, clipped for decision. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filler. One minor scaffold (“I thought of Clara…”) forgiven because it pivots to action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief-eating garden, cordless phone as confessional, metamorphosis as absolution. Each element is irreplaceable—remove the phone or arrowhead and the ritual collapses. The “gravitationally playful” physics is more than quirk; it enables the transformation. Risky choices cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
