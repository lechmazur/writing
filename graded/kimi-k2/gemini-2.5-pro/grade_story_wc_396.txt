<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and character-specific—his “to map empathy onto action” motive is dramatized through the quartz shard choice and oracle vision, but minor exposition occasionally slips into therapy-speak parameterizing his process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Causal lens holds cleanly: act → vision leak → decisive speech resolves the crisis, compressing over one continuous beat with a visible credibility cost when Mara’s shoulders slump. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse orchard is sparingly drawn—wind-bitten apple boughs, grinding floes—but gives one tactical beat (Kael’s mirror rummage) and returns dialogically in Mara's sigh-cloud. Body/micro-setting meet the 9+ gate threshold once.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“will the community split?”—escalates via agency: Kael’s mirror use tightens options and gains Jorn’s nod, ending the weighted breath with felt relational cost. One genuine tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete micro-choices: empathy mapped to action earns a non-literal resonance in the frictional shared exhale. No moralizing; ambiguity remains inviting yet coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is crisp—Kael pins attention to quartz coolness, hammer-flat wind. No head-hopping; rhythmic control solid under pressure; decorative phrase “frictional shared exhale” slightly elevated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Clean, propulsive sentences; one paraphrase loop around “hemet/forestall panic” docks a minor −0.2. Otherwise high density, zero clarity artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes familiar lighthouse community + fracture into a fresh emotional map. The oracle-specific reframing of guilt via quartz shard feels inevitable; no derivative echoes.</comment>
