<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the rosette as microcosm of his struggle is specific. The shift from resigned to purely expectant is earned through the breathing exercise and the cost of two years’ friction. Choir remains off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A; single-POV interior arc is strong.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence and shared breath reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—fragile harmony achieved by carving away noise, with felt cost in the grudging history momentarily suspended. No orientation debt; single scene, one transition to rehearsal room.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Velvet library and autumn decay are vivid yet selective; the rosette functions as micro-setting that constrains the final pedagogy. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elias’s woodworker-musician eye. Final image of “resonance in a quiet room” recharges the library’s stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—braiding hostile voices—signaled early. Escalation is the failed hymn; tightening comes via subtraction method that forecloses old tactics. Cost is the exposure of raw, shared breath and the risk of further failure. Agency remains Elias’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme of harmony-through-absence emerges from the rosette’s negative space and the breathing exercise, never sermonized. Final image offers non-literal answer: music born from carved-away hatred. Subtext in the hesitant glances and unified hum carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet precise (“slow, magnificent decay,” “textures in a single, unified sound”). Rhythm modulates with tension—long sentences for reflection, clipped for instruction. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and sparse. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. “Carved away to let a fragile music breathe” crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Familiar premise—choir reconciles enemies—is transformed through the rosette’s negative-space metaphor and the subtraction pedagogy. Specificity of woodworking detail and the embodied breathing exercise feel fresh. Risk in quiet, lyric closure pays off.</comment>
