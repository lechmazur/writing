<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyra’s blindness despite clairvoyance and her renunciation at the threshold are interior contradictions dramatized, making her Earned Stasis both believable and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra’s gift dies so the world may live; the lens is Accumulative: density increases toward a single crystalline cadence shift that reweights everything.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystal cave pressures every choice through song, silence, and shadow; its specificity (song-stones creating path, withholding passage) constrains tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate not through reversals but through intensifying sonic instability and lyric shadow tableaux that crystallize Lyra’s abdication with visible, felt cosmic price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Quiet Miracle ask—renounce control so restrained everyday magic may bloom—grows from Lyra’s misbelief and resolves through the cave’s luminous surrender, not a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compressed lyric prose mirrors the cave’s song; limited 3rd-person stays character-bound; the bracket of “brighter” window shimmer and “duller water” keeps voice particular under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft achieves crystalline rhythm without abstract filler; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere, and the final crystalline note lands free of ornamental clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clairvoyant guardian meets sentient cave-of-art, culminating in renunciation that recharges the mundane; risky lyric mode pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
