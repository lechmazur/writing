<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s watchful-dreamer trait is embodied in her micro-choices (humidity, tea, silence) and crystallizes in the pendant transfer; Kaelen’s haunted passivity is credibly maintained until the final breath. Interiority is specific and embodied (“her fingers ghosting over the green velvet of the moss”). The closing gesture earns its cost: Elara forfeits her talisman of permanence, Kaelen accepts the possibility of thaw. Only a trace of diagnostic label-speak (“public failure”) keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the pendant hand-off reconfigures meaning without tidy resolution, cost felt in Elara’s relinquishment. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern emergence (drip-map) reweights the stake of “fossil vs. flow.” Orientation is anchored by ~80 words. No lens ambiguity; the final hush is fertile ground, not epilogue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moss-coated server racks and dripping slate panel are not backdrop but active constraint: humidity levels matter, the drip pattern literally writes the thematic map. Sensory detail is selective (petrichor, damp earth, green velvet) and filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze. The amber pendant functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Only the off-stage “confession went viral” keeps it from 8.9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kaelen’s frozen shame vs. Elara’s offer of thaw—is signaled early and tightened once: the drip pattern becomes the visible test of whether stasis can become flow. Agency is Elara’s quiet proactivity culminating in the pendant proffer; cost is her surrender of permanence. Pressure grows accumulatively; no reversals needed. The viral aftermath remains abstract, slightly blunting visceral escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between permanence (amber) and flux (drip-map) without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: the necklace transfer says “you are not the fossil” more powerfully than any line. Final image reweights the premise—rust as bed for life—through concrete particulars. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “different kind of hush.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual signature (“honeyed hush,” “green velvet,” “prehistoric sap”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer cadences in caretaker moments, clipped delivery at the pendant reveal. No head-hopping; Kaelen’s interiority is inferred through gesture and silence. Voice remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “the honeyed hush… thick with the scent of petrichor” layers sensory data without clutter. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—patient drip sentences early, tighter cadence at climax. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic server farm as moss sanctuary feels fresh; the drip-map as living circuit diagram is a non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional arc collapses. Tropes (shamed tech genius, healing garden) are reconfigured through tactile specificity and quiet stakes. Risk is taken in the understated ending; coherence remains intact.</comment>
