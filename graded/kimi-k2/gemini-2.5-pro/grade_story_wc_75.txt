<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alistair’s interiority is vivid—his historian’s reflex with the lens, the tactile memory of the concert hall—but the shift from despair to sonic epiphany leans on summary rather than embodied contradiction. Elara’s loaf is a perfect micro-choice that crystallizes stakes, yet the council’s flat resignation weakens relational pressure. The final cost is felt: culture saved, but only through collective voice, not solitary curation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: frozen fall → lens reveals fractures → memory of resonance → communal song → thaw. The single transition from council chamber to cavern is clean; closure lands with audible cost as the roar returns. No orientation drift; stakes tighten from extinction to rebirth in one arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s phosphorescent moss dimming under frost, the yeasty warmth against sterile cold, and the emerald lens filtering glare all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Alistair notices what a curator would. Spatial choreography is flawless; the cavern’s acoustics become the weapon that saves it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultural and physical survival—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through visible ice fractures. The tightening beat is the shift from “we can only pray” to “we can persuade it,” paid for by risking the last communal voice. Cost is audible: the city’s silence replaced by thunder, their anthem now their lifeline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: memory is useless unless sung into present action. The bread-initial motif reweights from quaint nostalgia to tactical catalyst. Final image—roaring water, warm ‘A’ in hand—reconfigures preservation as living practice, not artifact curation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is precise, curator-cool yet lyric under pressure: “rosewater dread,” “spun-glass voice.” Syntax modulates with urgency—short imperatives at the climax. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Alistair’s sensory and intellectual priorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh and integrated—“museum of memory,” “web of deadly potential.” Final cadence shift from hush to roar is earned by rhythmic build in the choral passage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar ice-apocalypse frame is transformed through sonic resonance as cultural rescue, not brute force. The opera-glass lens repurposed as engineering tool feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk taken: a quiet, collective victory instead of heroic solo act—coherence maintained.</comment>
