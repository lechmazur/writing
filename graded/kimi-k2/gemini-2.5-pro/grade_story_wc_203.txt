<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s childlike motive (“what ceilings hide”) is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—headlamp beam, ladder screech, brass cylinder—showing a hierarchy of values under spectral pressure. The final renunciation (leaving the dead’s secret intact) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the ghost’s calm dissipation. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. One hairline slip: “weightless burden” is slightly self-diagnostic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Leo’s stance crystallizes when he pockets the mainspring, reweighting his vocation from machine-mender to veil-mender. Causal lens holds—each beat (power cut → ghost gesture → dust pattern → ladder climb) tightens options toward the single decisive act. Cost is legible in the ghost’s vanishing and Leo’s silent acceptance of an unfinished task. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: peeling clown paint, greasy hoist cables, disturbed dust on one tile—all constrain Leo’s gaze and ladder placement. The brass cylinder on the rafter functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (smell of trapped time, chill not from weather) filters through Leo’s professional eye. One minor redundancy: “phantom smell of popcorn” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair the crack in the veil—tightens once when Leo chooses to engage rather than leave. Escalation is causal: ghost’s agitation → dust anomaly → ladder ascent → retrieval. Cost is felt in the ghost’s release and Leo’s quiet acceptance of an unspoken covenant. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden truths and unfinished obligations emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked clown smiles, the hidden mainspring, the mended veil. Final image (Leo closing his fist around the brass) offers non-literal answer to “what ceilings hide” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost’s silent plea and Leo’s wordless reply. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and profession-filtered: “greasy guts of the lift mechanism,” “furry grey blanket” of dust. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during ascent, longer reflection after retrieval. No POV leakage; psychic distance stays tight. One micro-register drift: “conceptual cost” in final paragraph edges toward editorial, but context justifies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and precise: “memory in the silent air.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs anchor action: “dragged,” “ascended,” “closed.” Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech + ghost seer + circus clockmaker’s unfinished carousel heart. Tropes are transformed through Leo’s upward gaze and the mainspring’s quiet resurrection. Risky quiet ending pays off with earned resonance. Specificity (brass cylinder, disturbed dust) prevents generic overlay.</comment>
