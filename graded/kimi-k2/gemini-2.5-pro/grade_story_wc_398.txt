<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—Mourvèdre passion vs. Grenache need—is embodied in every beat: from the way he fingers the letter to the final release of placing it away. Flaws, memory-scars, and earned stasis create a fully dimensional, solitary guide whose silence is itself an action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a subtle conceptual repricing: the burned edge becomes the lace of an autumn leaf, re-defining his self-imposed exile as care, not defense. Causal lens holds tight—each bus fade-out tightens his options until quiet acceptance is the only reaction left.</comment>

<comment>Autumn light, fermented-earth scent, amber pavilion—all pressure his mood and prune the visual final image. Pavilion and opposing vines ground spatial stakes; the closing frost on glass is a tactile meter of time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical compression, consistent POV drift and sensory filter keep rhythm; no head-hops. Sentence control breathes with emotional beats—short gasps under frost, long vowels in memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops, high information density, and metaphor always multiples stakes without clutter: scorched lace final image simultaneously vilifies and validates memory fragility.</comment>

<comment>The wine-rootstock graft as failed love reframes cliché into felt agricultural truth; metaphor feels inevitable once taught, charged by specificity and labor-history.</comment>
