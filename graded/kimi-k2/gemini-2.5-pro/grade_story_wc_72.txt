<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—crusader’s certainty vs. dawning horror—is embodied in the ampoule’s weight and the gill’s living pulse. Her micro-choice to bury the poison crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost (forfeited mission, surface exile implied). Galen’s telepathy is less a second character than a catalytic voice, so relationship crucible is thin; still, the pressure on Mara is acute and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (“they were not conquerors” → gill discovery → burial of ampoule) tightens options until the decisive refusal lands on the page. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—where burying the ampoule forecloses the attack path with felt moral cost. No orientation drift; spatial anchors (plinth, membrane, sediment) remain coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The underwater garden is not backdrop; its bioluminescent flora and filtration gill directly constrain Mara’s tactics and charge the final image when the vine on Galen’s shoulder pulses brighter. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“crushed pearl and obsidian” noticed only as she swims the path). One minor slip: “ghost-white skate” feels ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent desecration—escalates as each revelation reweights the mission from righteous purge to piracy. The single tightening beat (realizing the “weakness” is a lung) narrows options to poison or renounce; cost is legible in the burial act. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of complicity vs. stewardship emerges through concrete particulars (foxglove as “purifier” lie, gill as living lung). Final image—buried ampoule, brightened vine—offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext in Galen’s “incisively kind” silence carries more weight than any spoken indictment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control under pressure (“ghost of a vast and terrible silence”). POV stays locked to Mara; Galen’s telepathy is rendered as italicized thought-projection, cleanly distinguished. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is kept within Mara’s plausible intellectual frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One near-scaffold (“the dead quiet, filling it with the ghost…”) is justified by the sonic void it evokes. Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate; only minor filter-verb slips (“she thought of the intricate…”) that do not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—underwater ruin, telepathic mentor—are transformed through sensory specificity and moral inversion. The “living statue” is less fantasy device than geological conscience; the foxglove ampoule reprises its mythic toxicity with fresh ecological stakes. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
