<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kenji’s interiority is embodied and specific—his shears, the salt air, the compass weight in his palms. The contradiction between his placid ritual and the churning grief is dramatized in micro-choices (tracing lace, climbing bluff). The final diffusion of guilt is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: the compass light fades, regret thins but does not vanish. Only the “cerulean regret” label skirts diagnostic speak, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ritual, lace decoding, tide-wind opposition accrues until the compass steadies and guilt diffuses. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief becomes “gentle, rhythmic swell” with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One transition (cottage→bluff) is seamless. Closure lands on the page with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Islet, juniper, salt air, granite bluff—all vivid, selective, filtered through Kenji’s grief-sharpened senses. Weather (wind against tide) directly enables the compass’s steadying, constraining the final choice. Micro-setting (lace square, compass) functions as charged objects. Only the sky’s “cerulean regret” edges toward overt symbolism, preventing 8.8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: diffuse concentrated guilt or drown in it. Pressure tightens once: wind turns against tide, compass steadies, Kenji must act. The diffusion is irreversible and costly—memories lose their “brutal concentration.” Agency is internal yet decisive; no external antagonist needed. Coincidence (wind shift) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: bonsai ritual, lace map, compass that points to loss. Final image reweights the premise—grief becomes livable medium rather than weapon. No moralizing; resonance lingers in “quiet contemplation” and softened juniper silhouette. Subtext in lace knots and compass glow carries the apology Kenji could never speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, tactile, salted with grief; perceptual signature is consistent—needle snip, velvet bed, whalebone weight. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to shorter pulses at the bluff. No dialogue, so no register drift. Compression in “tides of remembrance” is taught early and paid off. One near-cliché (“cerulean regret”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every image does double duty. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity—“salt and damp earth,” “ghost ship’s compass”—anchors abstraction. Only minor register lift in “posthumous act of kindness,” quickly grounded by tactile follow-through. Closure beat is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-ritual frame is transformed through lace-as-code and compass-that-points-inward. Synthesis feels inevitable: trimming bonsai becomes trimming sorrow. Risk taken in quiet, internal climax pays off; no gimmicks. Fresh inflection: the compass points down, not outward, collapsing geography into psyche.</comment>
