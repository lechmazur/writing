<comment>Kaelen’s grandfather-haunted motive, embodied via the heirloom spore-catalyst and the Hasselblad ritual, is interiorly rich and drives every choice. The final, camera-silent moment—“a memory far more vivid than any film”—crystallizes renunciation and earned cost without tidy epiphany. Still, emotional layering flirts with poetic over-label (“beautiful, inevitable extinction”) in the peak beat, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The accretive pattern—cold endurance → chemical callnote → bloom → obliteration—reorganizes meaning into a final Earned Stasis: Kaelen preserves an unshareable truth at the cost of communion. Causality is lyrically compressed, not broken; each beat deepens the last, charged by the on-page sublimation of the garden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The moonlit vacuum, the crunch of regolith inside the suit’s audio feed, the “vibrating stillness” before flare: every environmental constraint is tactile and shapes Kaelen’s camera positioning and metabolism. The summit itself becomes a hostile witness that demands the physical outlay of heat, battery, and breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—“record the last of something precious”—compresses through rising cold, single-use lure, and irreversible bloom fade. Escalation is internal: endurance vs irrelevance. The tightening is legible, though the price (solitary memory) feels more reflective than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus preservation surfaces through inherited timepiece, obsolete mechanical camera versus fading bio-light, ending in unsalvageable beauty. Message emerges from the final dissolution, not exposition. A counter-reading lingers: documentation as elegy rather than salvation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate POV modulates from technical precision (“substrate gel… phosphorus-binding proteins”) to breath-held lyricism. Sensory selection is inspector-biased—thermal groans, lumen intensity. No POV slippage; every perception is filtered through the pressure suit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Compression is ruthless: every clause harvests either temperature discomfort, chemical procedure, or luminous fractal. Figurative language is sparse and justified (“sunlight sliced… like a blade”). Zero loops or scaffold detected; cadence quickens naturally as blooms peak. Final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The crystalline extinction blossom, the hourglass of engineered spores, the anachronistic Hasselblad—each choice feels inevitable only to this moon at this hour. It fuses elegiac SF with environmental vanitas; removing any single strand unravels the conceptual tapestry.</comment>
