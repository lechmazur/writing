<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict flashes in key beats—the coral’s weight between memory and doubt during the last scar—but therapy-speak intrudes (“grief-tainting the chronicle”) and her shift feels more narrated than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal arc holds: breath-in → scar-mapping → breath-out story, but closure’s emotional jump (“golden light erupts”) needs fuller justification through prior causation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The corroded statue body as micro-setting anchors choice, and the coral’s texture becomes living coral/artifact constraint; gear shop is mostly backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the last story—tightens with every scar, but escalation leans on narration rather than visible narrowing of live options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme threads through scars and golden veins, yet late “meaning conjured” statement flirts with moralizing instead of earning resonance through felt ruin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poetic but specific interiority (“screaming green tumult”) is embodied; no voice drift under pressure, compression taught by coral return in final beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; vivid sensory rhythm accelerates at climax; occasional clichés (“silent, pressurized space”) and redundant “phantom scent” weaken impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh acid-sea premise integrated into alchemy ritual keeps tropes original; kintsugi-as-memory device, while familiar, is grounded in tactile binding work.</comment>
