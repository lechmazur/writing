<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness is woven into her tactile artistry and the coin-reading task; her renunciation of escape for the sky-mirroring act carries visible cost as the building groans. Interiority is embodied (“air tasted of ancient paper”) and choices track motive. The flaw drives the mistake of lingering, compounding final risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the living sky is achieved at the price of entombment. Causal chain—coin → lock → stone → heartwood—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt. Cost is legible in the final “building groaned its final protest.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The petrified-oak library, dust motes, and groaning superstructure are vivid, selective, and constrain every move; the heartwood knot literally enables the sky-mirror. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s tactile bias. Setting charges the final image rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trap wonder before demolition—tightens as machinery revives. One decisive turn: she chooses to stay and press the stone, foreclosing escape. Agency drives escalation; cost is the imminent collapse felt in the closing beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “beauty within boundaries” emerges from the fractal coin, the finite library, and the contained cosmos. No moralizing; the final sky reweights earlier limits into triumph. Subtext in the silence and dust carries emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, lyrical, and consistent: “pattern of their anxieties, the texture of their hopes.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses as the building groans. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Elara’s touch-centric world.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers scent, texture, or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates during the lock-picking and slows for the sky-birth. Clean mechanics; final image crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of a face-blind artist encoding infinity on a coin to birth a sky inside a dying tree-library is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of doomed sanctuaries and secret knowledge are transformed through tactile specificity and fractal logic. Risky compression pays off.</comment>
