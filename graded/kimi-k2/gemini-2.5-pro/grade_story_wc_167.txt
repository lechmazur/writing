<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silas’s interior contradiction—yearning to fix light in glass while sensing its inevitable flux—drives every beat. The stone-skip is a concrete micro-choice that crystallizes his renunciation; the cost is the atrium itself. No stock phrasing; embodied perception (“marrow of his bones,” “texture of the mist”) grounds emotion. Flawed insight (he once believed permanence possible) compounds to Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the prism atrium’s final rainbowed dissolution reweights the premise—value lies in seeing, not saving. Causal chain: subtle environmental shift → stone oracle → renunciation. Lens held throughout (Accumulative/Textural). Cost is legible in the last image: “he wouldn’t try to save it.” Orientation anchored within first 120 words; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pearl Bay’s dawn fog, the granite outcrop, and the dark pond each constrain tactics and charge the final image. The atrium itself becomes micro-setting that refracts the sunrise into closure. Sensory hierarchy (salt scent, glass texture) filters through Silas’s glazier bias. No static catalog; every detail bends back to the stake of transience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs. accept impermanence—tightens once: the stone’s rings reveal the atrium’s doom. Escalation is Accumulative: density of sensory and symbolic cues increases until the rainbow detonation. Cost is the forfeiture of the structure; agency lies in Silas’s refusal to resist the tide. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: permanence is illusion, value is in perception. Subtext in the stone’s interference pattern and the final silent explosion. No moralizing; the prism’s last blaze is the non-literal answer. Complexity embraced—Silas neither mourns nor celebrates, simply sees. Resonance lingers without tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and glazier-specific: “cathedral of wonder,” “geometry of vapor.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for reflection, clipped fragments at climax. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression (“a slow and certain insight”) is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled and coherent (“ghost of glass and geometry”). High information density: “pearlescent glow felt thin” compresses mood and foreshadowing. No register drift; diction stays within Silas’s artisan lexicon. Final rainbow detonation rendered with exact verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a glazier who reads tidal patterns in pond ripples to foresee the obsolescence of his life’s work. The prism atrium as both setting and metaphor is non-obvious and inevitable. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no template echoes. Specificity of craft and bay ecology anchors universals of impermanence.</comment>
