<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the “hauntingly practical” stance is dramatized in her micro-choice to carve the exhale. The memory of Leo’s stillness with the cub crystallizes her motive and foreshadows the final act, but the widow identity remains more label than lived contradiction, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kettle’s rising whistle and the deepening cut in ash wood tighten the emotional cadence toward a Charged Poise. Closure lands in the final image—the scarred block as tangible anchor—felt cost legible in the silence after the scream. No orientation debt; the single-scene frame is cleanly anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft, copper kettle, and fresh-cut ash provide tactile micro-setting that constrains movement and mood. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; the scent of ash and chamomile steers memory and action. The loft itself does not force a tactical choice, so it stops short of 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest usable wisdom from loss—tightens once: the memory of stillness versus fear escalates to the carving of an “exhale.” The kettle’s crescendo supplies coherent pressure; the cost is the irreversible first cut that forecloses other memorials. Agency remains internal but visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of presence-over-dominance emerges organically from the cub memory and the carved arc; no explicit moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: control is not seized but offered as stillness. Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s grief-tempered practicality. Rhythm modulates with the kettle’s rise and the blade’s first cut. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture—clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensorily rich; every sentence advances atmosphere or motive. No loops, no mixed metaphors. The phrase “calm thunder” risks overwriting but is earned by Leo’s voice and immediately grounded in sawdust scent. Closure line is crisp.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The widow-tamer synthesis feels fresh; the cub-training memory reframes dominance without didacticism. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric closure rather than spectacle, and it pays off. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
