<question>1</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Elara’s interior motive (capture presence density) is embodied in tactile micro-choices; the contradiction between sterile calculus and messy living desire forces the decisive beat. Kael’s presence supplies credible interpersonal pressure, and his departure catalyzes costly renunciation. Small drag: one moment when Elara “thought of equations” summarises rather than feels. Overall, flawed alchemist is vivid and costly, but not unprecedented.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative pattern (failed spheres → final living sphere) tightens stakes without causal reversals; closure is Charged Poise—offered “living sun” crystallises options with felt cost (Kael’s tear). Time/place anchored by word two; all beats advance compression, no orientation debt. One micro-stutter: “dense gravity” metaphor strays into abstract causality but does not derail.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Twilight shimmer and crystalline dust ground the nexus as immediate stage; nautilus shell and pulse-sphere act like micro-settings constraining choices. Vivid sensory triangulation (chill shell, warm new light) charges final image. Atmosphere deepens but stays economical; one redundant “shimmering with residual magic” nearly loops.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: retain Kael’s felt presence vs abstract perfection. Escalation tightens once—departure threat intensifies urgency—closing with visible price (Kael walking away, Elara’s renunciation). No external reversals; coherence under Accumulative lens. Minor: stakes never grow beyond personal, but the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of living mess vs perfect formula emerges organically through objects and gesture; final living-sphere revalues entire lab quest without moralising. Subtext whispered in tear-track glint and offered warmth. Resists tidy aphorism; ambiguity lingers—“enough” feels earned. Only small hiccup: “density of presence” tag spoken aloud once too overtly.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Free-indirect third sustained, lyrical yet controlled: “scientifically romantic” internal lexicon matches alchemist mind. Dialogue sparse, carries subtext (“So you don’t forget what it feels like”). Prose rhythm modulates from chill glass pulses to warm, breathy cadences; no POV slippage. One filter-verb triad (“seemed to”) clustered slightly dulls peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lines are lean, figurative when useful; “sterile white” vs “warm, complex gold” shows information density driving stakes. Micro-paraphrase loops minimal—one instance of “cold, academic rhythm / sterile” echo. No artifact obscures closure. Ends on crystalline image, not exposition; propulsive cadence intact with one slight register drift in “logarithmic spiral made manifest” that reads professorial.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magic alchemy of feeling, not gold; turning “density of presence” into reconfigurable light object. Device feels inevitable yet surprising within this micro-frame. Risky quiet exit pays off. Derivative shell-object might dock points in another story, but here its re-weighted failure is specific to voice. One half-step deduction for familiar “whispered departure” trope.</comment>
