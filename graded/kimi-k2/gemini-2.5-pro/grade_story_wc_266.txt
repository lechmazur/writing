<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied (“hollow ache in the air”) and her micro-choice to stand and follow is credible, but the guides remain ornamental; their calm lacks pressure that would force her to reveal contradictory impulses. The final step is earned yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star-stamped kelp crystallizes her readiness and reweights the premise from “find courage” to “choose it.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory beat thickens the atmosphere until the mist parts by her willingness. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by 80 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Twilight, mist, and ridgeway are vivid and selective; the kelp ticket becomes micro-setting that constrains her choice. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the guides’ hats and lantern verge on generic placeholders. The final clearing mist charges the image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find unused courage”—is signaled early and tightened when the guides offer the blank ticket; the act of accepting it forecloses passive waiting. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the cadence shift from vigil to walking carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shift from seeking courage to enacting it; the star stamp reframes the quest without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence and gesture. The final image invites reflection without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature (“purple ink bleeding”) is consistent. Dialogue is spare and subtextual. No POV drift; the guides’ speech remains distinct from Elara’s interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is minimal. Information density is high; each sentence advances mood or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ferry guides and kelp ticket refresh familiar mythic tropes with tactile specificity. The “leash” metaphor is fresh and integrated. Risk is moderate; the lyric mode is well-executed but not boundary-pushing.</comment>
