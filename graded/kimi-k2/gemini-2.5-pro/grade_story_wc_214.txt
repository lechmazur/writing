<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s quiet yearning and embodied ritual with the glass anchor his arc; the climactic empathy beat crystallizes his internal contradiction—custodian vs. seeker—earning the resonant renunciation of isolation. Micro-choices (pressing glass to eyepiece, tracing with soul) are specific and costly. Minor: “spiritually curious” edges toward label, not fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each meteor tracing deepens texture until the empathic rupture reweights meaning. Closure—Kael’s stance shift from detached observer to participant in cosmic vulnerability—lands with felt cost (“whisper of cooling dust”). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Station’s dormant machinery and nebula edge frame Kael’s solitude; the yellow glass functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains perception and choice. Sensory detail is selective (starlight drifts, frictional heat) and filtered through Kael’s custodial gaze. Final image of dust recharges the setting with new resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kael remain a passive observer or risk empathic contact—tightens once when he presses the glass to the eyepiece. The single deepening (shared burn) narrows his options and forces the stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: the star’s death becomes his own momentary death, paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges from the meteor’s self-immolation and Kael’s mirrored surrender; no explicit moralizing. The final image reweights “dust” from waste to memory of light, achieving Conceptual Repricing without statement. Subtext resides in silence and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Lyric, controlled third-person limited stays tightly inside Kael’s perceptual field; diction (“cathedral of dormant machinery,” “incandescent scream”) is character-bound and rhythmic. No head-hopping or register drift. Compression (“He felt…”) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is sparse until the climax, where it intensifies without muddle. No loops or scaffold. Syntax modulates with pressure—short bursts during the burn, longer cadences in reflection. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar “lonely caretaker meets cosmos” frame is refreshed by the empathic tracing ritual and the inversion of janitor-as-chronicler-of-endings. Specificity of the yellow lantern glass salvaged from a first-gen solar sailor grounds the trope. Risk taken in lyric mode pays off.</comment>
