<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied through tactile memory and water-borne vibration; her blindness is not label but active constraint that drives the diagnostic method. Motivation (“decode feedback into direction”) is dramatized in every micro-choice, culminating in the earned stillness of her final gesture. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s healed hum and the basins’ perfect ripples crystallize the before/after of chaos-into-order under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is intact—each horn blast tightens temporal pressure—and the felt cost is Elara’s spent calm as she “sank onto her stool.” No orientation debt; lens holds to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and condensation-slick signal box are not backdrop but pressure: moisture that muffles sound and time, forcing Elara’s non-visual method. The repair-shop micro-setting (crystal basins, velvet cloth) constrains every tactical move. Final image of still water recharges the opening condensation, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the drone before anchor lift—is signaled in the harbormaster’s first warning. Escalation is the triplet of horn blasts, each shrinking Elara’s temporal margin. Agency is her tactile repair; cost is the audible shift from “dissonant thrum” to “clean, pure tone” and her own exhaustion. No reversal, but the single tightening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of order wrested from chaos emerges through concrete particulars: fractured micro-strut, trembling water, flawless concentric ripples. No explicit statement; final image of Elara listening to the departing ship offers non-literal resonance. Complexity is preserved—her triumph is quiet, solitary, and immediately eclipsed by the world’s onward motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s sensorium; diction is tactile and sonic (“needle-thin applicator,” “mournful blast”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during diagnosis, clipped fragments at the final horn. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “jewel waiting for its fire” is the single allowed flourish and it earns its place. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Information density is high—each sentence advances repair, stakes, or atmosphere. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the drone’s steady hum, achieving closure without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of blind artisan + water-refraction diagnostics + hummingbird drone feels inevitable and fresh. Risk is taken in the sensory inversion—sight replaced by fingertip ripples—and it pays off in both plot mechanics and thematic resonance. No recognizable template; specificity anchors the premise.</comment>
