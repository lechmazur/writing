<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arthur’s interior contradiction—faith vs. mechanical despair—is embodied in the velvet-wrapped heart and the “heavy, leaden thing” in his chest. The micro-choice to leave the heart with Elias crystallizes his shift from repairman to guide, with the cost of abandoning his prior identity. Elias’s brief presence supplies relational pressure that reframes Arthur’s vocation. Only the slight over-articulation of “I offered him scripture…” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Arthur’s renunciation of apology-language reconfigures his future tactics under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The storm-light image reweights the premise without resolving it, leaving the cost of unspoken grief intact. Causality holds cleanly from the heart’s reveal to the final nod. A hairline slip: the “calm before realization” framing is slightly meta, nudging it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The antique shop’s hush and brass gleam function as micro-setting that constrains Arthur’s prison-honed reflexes; the storm-light through the grimy window becomes the literal mechanism of revelation. Sensory selection is filtered through Arthur’s chaplain’s eye—light “didn’t choose the clean spots.” The heart itself serves as portable setting, its gears a tactile map of Thorne’s despair. Only the brief static postcard of “wet street” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Arthur’s need to atone for failing Thorne—tightens when Elias reframes the task from repair to witness. The single deepening beat (light through clouds) narrows Arthur’s options without external antagonist. Cost is felt in Arthur’s relinquishment of the heart and his prior pastoral method. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no reversals, but one decisive reweighting suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of unearned grace emerges through the storm-light image rather than sermon; the heart-as-lockbox metaphor carries the conceptual repricing. Subtext in Elias’s “we talk a lot about what we deserve” reframes the prison logic without overt statement. Final image of Arthur walking out into “vibrant, hopeful hush” offers non-literal resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether grace will reach the next inmate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Arthur’s perceptual signature—comparing quiet to “louder” than prison clang—anchors voice early. Syntax modulates from measured cadence to the breath-held final line. Dialogue is spare, subtextual; Elias’s speech carries the weight of shared history without exposition. No POV drift; every detail is filtered through Arthur’s sensory hierarchy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “dust motes, ancient and golden, danced” does triple duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or interiority. Metaphors (light as “impartial glory”) are precise and earned. A single mixed register moment—“conceptual repricing” risk in Elias’s speech—is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The clockwork heart as soul-lockbox is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of steampunk and pastoral crisis. Prison chaplain seeking repair of a mechanical organ reframes the salvation trope without gimmickry. Storm-light revelation feels inevitable yet surprising in hindsight. Specificity of the antique shop and the felt-hammer voice distinguish this from generic redemption arcs.</comment>
