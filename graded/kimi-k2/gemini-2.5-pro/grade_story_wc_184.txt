<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's "translate confusion into clarity" drive is present, embodied, and pays off, but the internal conflict remains largely monoline; no contradictory impulse complicates his final move, so the cost feels cerebral rather than visceral—just shy of high-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the door becomes stable, Elias’s integrative act earns a tangible reconfiguration, and causality under an accumulative-textural lens stays intact; the “weaving the rope into gears” beat crystallizes both stakes and cost without rupture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mechanism-room details are tactile and character-filtered, and the reading-room finale reweights the absent principality, but the tower interior never physically constrains choice; it mostly serves as atmospheric cradle, missing the 9+ gate by a hair.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Pressure tightens through the “impossible door → seal match → ceremonial rope” beat chain, narrowing Elias's option from puzzle to integration, but the tension leans academic; a sharper, bodily-felt price would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of integration versus erasure is lucid and emerges from Elias’s specific actions, but the final entry card veers toward meta articulation rather than silence or image; still, no false moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is scholarly-archivist yet sensorily particular—“scent of old paper and beeswax,” “clean, complex energy”—and rhythm modulates under pressure; single POV holds without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and almost free of scaffold; one micro-loop (“delicate act... act of translation”) barely registers; diction remains precise and character-bound throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The “archive of erased countries” premise is fresh, the weaving of timelines literalised, and the understated magic feels new yet inevitable; still, archivist-hero archetype tempers the risk factor.</comment>
