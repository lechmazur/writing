<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—paint-stained fingers, lilac unease, reading shoulders like paragraphs. The contradictory impulse (whimsy vs. despair) is present but never forces a micro-choice that costs her; the mandala is a foregone act. The final renunciation of speech for pattern is earned, yet the cost is diffuse—felt more by the onlookers than by her knees in sand. Still, she reads as an individual, not a trope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the mandala’s center tile crystallizes a communal focus without breaking the hush. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence, then color, then shared gaze. Cost is visible in the collective posture shift and in Elara’s gritty knees. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist and acoustics constrain the only viable language—visual pattern over sound. Sensory detail is selective: damp archways, lavender-grey shroud, gritty sand. The whispering tile’s coolness is tactile and later charges the mandala’s core. Micro-setting (tile flake) functions as setting that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to rediscover meaning when language fails. Escalation is accretive—silence thickens, wanderers drift closer, mandala tightens the focus. One deepening beat: placing the tile at center reweights the silence into shared attention. Cost is diffuse but legible in relinquished speech.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between entropy and pattern; no explicit moralizing. The mandala’s violet/gold spirals reconfigure chaos without naming it. Subtext lives in silence and posture. Final image—tile gleaming amid sand—offers a non-literal answer: meaning is made, not found.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “lilac unease,” “fossilized promise of resonance.” Syntax modulates with pressure—longer coils of mist, then clipped sand pours. No dialogue, so no register clash. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara reads the world as surface and symbol simultaneously.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm breathes with scene: mist coils, sand spirals. High information density without clutter. Clean grammar; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chalk nebulae, whispering tile, emergent hush, sand mandala—each transformed through Elara’s specific art. The silent grotto as canvas feels inevitable. Risk in eschewing dialogue pays off; closure remains legible. No close echoes of prior works.</comment>
