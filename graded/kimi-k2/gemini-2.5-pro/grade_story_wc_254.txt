<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“shivering not from cold but from a profound quietude”—and his aesthetic compulsion is dramatized through the micro-choice to dissolve boundaries. The final renunciation of external interpretation carries visible cost: he forfeits the safety of literal translation and accepts the risk of madness. No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory pattern (hush, hum, quartz light) tightens until the cadence shift at “the colonnade was not chaos; it was a blueprint.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where Kael’s stance crystallizes with the felt cost of irreversible exposure to the forbidden frequency. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are not backdrop; their stillness and vastness pressure Kael toward dissolution of self. The quartz pillars act as micro-setting that constrains his final choice—he must merge or retreat. Final image of the lake as “blank page” recharges the opening silence, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the colonnade without succumbing—tightens once when Kael decides to dissolve boundaries. Cost is legible: he risks sanity and forfeits prior interpretive safety. Escalation is a single deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the danger of unmediated truth versus sanctioned meaning. Subtext lives in the silence and hum—never labeled “freedom” or “control.” Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the lake as blank page implies both invitation and erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—“cloud-shadow poet,” “lantern-moth hush”—and perceptual signature remains consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, breath-held sentences early, then crystalline fragments at the tremor of certainty. No POV drift; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are precise—“sheet of polished bone.” One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” in commentary, not story) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—poet seeks grammar of forbidden quartz song—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric mode commits fully; no derivative echoes. The transformation test passes: swap poet for scholar and the arc collapses.</comment>
