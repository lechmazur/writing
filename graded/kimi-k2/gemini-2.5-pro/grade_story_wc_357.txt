<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is vivid and embodied; her refusal to “watch them die” drives every beat. Interiority is specific—she “allows herself” only the dampeners’ thrum, a tactile restraint that mirrors her desperation. The final choice to shear the shard carries visible cost: the arrow’s hum ceases, the droplets fall, and the hour ends. A hairline slip: the blight’s stakes are stated, not embodied in her body or orchard, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the shard secured, the river reversing, the silence broken by insects—an earned reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain holds: arrow hum → crystal → shard → silence ends. Orientation is anchored early by the viewport and orchard planet. One micro-turn: using the arches instead of dodging them. No slips touch the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The inverted river and floating arches are not backdrop; they are the only viable path to the Anechoic Heart. The geode’s levitating droplets constrain her time and movement. Sensory hierarchy is tight: the hum in teeth, the cool obsidian, the “shimmering, cohesive column” of water. Final image—the glowing shard against ailing trees—charges the setting with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the orchard—tightens when the hourglass of inversion forces the shard theft. Pressure escalates via the arrow’s frantic pitch and the falling droplets. Cost is on-page: she races the reasserted gravity, forfeits the arrow’s guidance, and accepts an unknown future. No external antagonist needed; time and physics suffice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: resilience is not a cure but a memory that must be stolen and re-planted. The “gathering of echoes” reweights from myth to literal life-force. Final image—seed pod bursting green—offers non-literal answer to the blight without moralizing. Subtext in the arrow’s silence and the insects’ return lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, compressed, and precise: “the world turned upside down with a grace that defied its own violence.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s—she measures silence as pressure, notices dust motes as “heralds.” Rhythm accelerates under time pressure; no filter-verb stacks. No dialogue, so no leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the river peeled away from its bed” compresses cause and spectacle. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Metaphors are coherent—water as “liquid road,” silence as “pressure.” Final line lands clean: “a world desperate to remember how to live.” No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The inversion-hour as navigational window, the arrow relic as map, and the geode as memory-bank synthesize into a fresh planetary myth. Risk: gravity reversal could read gimmick, but it’s taught early and paid off at closure. Specificity—“gossamer-fruit trees,” “ochre soil”—anchors the fantastical. Transformation test fails: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
