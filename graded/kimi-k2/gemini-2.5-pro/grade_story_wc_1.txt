<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is embodied (shaking hands, deliberate archaeology) and her shift from fear to purposeful kiln-lighting is earned. The contradictory impulse—fear of fire vs need to understand—drives micro-choices. Cost is felt: she seals the ledger strip, accepting its ghosts. Secondary characters are off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the kiln re-lit, the fused panel holding terror and wisdom. Causal lens holds—each frost reading tightens the path to the cave. Orientation is anchored early (canyon, stars, ruin). One transition (walk back) is within scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Canyon wind, sentinel rock, and frost patterns constrain her route and cipher. The kiln’s maw and the cobalt shard act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-driven (luminous glass artist noticing light and texture). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: find purpose after destruction. Escalation via frost-cipher tightens options; the cave discovery forecloses ignorance. Cost is the emotional price of relighting the kiln. Agency is hers—she chooses to trace and to seal the ledger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of survival-through-attention emerges from concrete acts: sifting ruin, reading frost, sealing ghosts. No explicit moralizing; resonance arises from the final fused panel holding both fire and ice. Complexity is honored—no tidy redemption, only earned understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, matching an artist’s perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (“ghost-heat,” “drifting resonance”). No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid but occasionally drifts toward poetic overlay (“luminous glass artist,” “drifting resonance”) that slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or scaffold; rhythm varies. Information density is high. Minor overwriting in peak beats keeps it below 8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: frost as living cipher, kiln as memory and tool. Transformation of ledger strip into art feels inevitable. Risky quiet ending lands via earned image. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
