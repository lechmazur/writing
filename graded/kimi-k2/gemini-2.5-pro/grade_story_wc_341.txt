<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific—his grief is embodied in the act of cloud-naming, and the final renunciation of writing down “The Unbroken Spool” shows earned cost. The contradiction between scientific detachment and emotional need is dramatized, not stated. One minor slip: “quietly explosive” is named rather than enacted until the noctilucent cloud appears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fractal cloud reweights the premise that “empty spaces remember,” and Elias’s silence after naming it carries felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each cloud logged tightens the emotional density until the final image. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gondola, telescope, and stratospheric night constrain every choice; the telescope’s brass chill and the “dusty starlight” charge the final image. Sensory selection is filtered through Elias’s meteorologist eye—cirrus as “tendrils of first hesitation” is both precise and character-bound. One hairline slip: “sprawling architecture” edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove the void retains Lena—tightens with each cloud named; the noctilucent fractal forces the decisive crystallization. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals are needed. Cost is visible in Elias’s final refusal to record, accepting permanent drift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of mapping grief onto atmosphere; the final image answers the question “do spaces remember?” without moralizing. Subtext lives in the silence after the last naming. The spiral fractal reweights every prior cloud entry, achieving resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision braided with elegiac cadence (“a repository, a library of echoes”). Perceptual signature is consistent; the POV never exceeds Elias’s knowledge. Compression and patterned elision (“He didn’t need to write this one down”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense—each sentence advances image or emotion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One minor register drift: “cosmic emotion” momentarily abstracts the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—memorializing a beloved by reading her signature in stratospheric ice—is fresh and fully committed. The fractal spiral as Lena’s autograph transforms a familiar grief story into something inevitable yet unforeseen. Risk in the lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
