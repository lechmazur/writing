<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris’s grief-anchored obsession is embodied in tactile micro-choices—drumming, map-tracing, slumping—yet the interior contradiction between scientific detachment and desperate hope stays vivid. The final renunciation (accepting cyclical memory instead of permanent recovery) is earned and carries visible cost: the reef’s resurrection lasts only a minute. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (reef memory) is ≤20 % and tilts present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the viewport blooms with living reef, then reverts, reweighting Aris’s purpose from search to stewardship. Causal lens holds: each rhythmic trial tightens options until the missing beat is discovered. Cost is legible in the single sentence “The vision held for only a minute.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s metal console and circular viewport constrain every action; the reef outside shifts from bone-white to living color and back, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “cool metal casing,” “shimmering like heat haze.” Environment directly shapes the climax—no postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Lena’s path—tightens when the neap-tide/thermal inversion triggers the “final prerequisite.” Agency is rhythmic assembly; the missed spiral symbol narrows options to one last attempt. Cost is the ephemeral minute of restored reef. No external antagonist needed; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical memory versus irreversible loss emerges through coral resurrection and fade, never stated. Subtext in the spiral symbol: a heartbeat rhythm that summons the past without keeping it. Final image reweights the premise: eternity is touchable but not holdable. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Aris; perceptual signature is marine-scientist precise (“gravimetric distortions,” “neap tide”) yet lyrically mournful. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences drift, then staccato taps. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal only and flawless.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“fish like shards of stained glass”). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports rising tension. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he would unroll… he would sit…”) is voice-motivated and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: climate grief meets magical-realist oceanic memory summoned by rhythmic code. The periodically eternal reef is a non-obvious angle on restoration fantasy. Transformation test fails if reef swapped out—core to closure. Risk in rhythmic magic is fully committed and paid off.</comment>
