<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motivation is lucid and consistent; the final renunciation of saviorhood lands as earned cost. Interiority is textured (“profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze”) and embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, and the single on-page character limits relationship crucible scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen’s acceptance of irreversible loss crystallizes in the tableau of tapestry + diary. Causal linkage is clean—each diary fragment escalates knowledge until the psychic axis concept reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The silo’s “bronze quiet” and curved walls are returned to at closure, constraining Kaelen’s choice to surrender rather than act. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“dust-moted light”). Spatial choreography remains coherent; no world-rule drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loss of collective imagination—is signaled early and tightened by each diary entry. Pressure grows under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image reweights the stake with felt cost. No external reversals, but internal deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the death of myth as psychic severance. The tapestry/dragon motif reprises at closure, reweighting meaning without moralizing. Subtext resides in Elara’s decision to burn knowledge—an act Kaelen honors by archiving ache rather than cure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (“ghost of the ink”). No dialogue, so no register clash. Free-indirect compression is clean; no POV leakage. Diction stays within plausible historian lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“cupping memory like water”). No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with pressure. One minor register elevation (“thread-of-gold fire”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—psychic axis displacement causing myth-death—is fresh and fully committed. Dragons as lost archetypes avoid stock fantasy; transformation test passes. Specificity of silo-library and tapestry grounds the concept. Risk distinction +0.2 for quiet apocalypse.</comment>
