<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—guilt vs. the urge to edit—are embodied in micro-choices (tracing the pen, frantic console work, deliberate unbending). The final renunciation costs him the fantasy of absolution and is earned by the preceding cascade of failed edits. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The dried pen as relic and mirror of identity is handled with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: anomaly → signal → edit attempts → unbending. Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: he encodes a footnote instead of altering history, with visible cost—he forfeits the chance to save the colony. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The final pulse fading into cosmic hum is an earned, on-page image that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active constraint: it bends spacetime, enables the temporal crease, and finally reframes the station as cloister. Sensory detail is selective—weight on skin, hum in bones—filtered through Kaelen’s professional bias. The pen functions as micro-setting, its meteoritic iron linking personal and cosmic scales. No white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to rewrite the fatal byte—is signaled early and tightened by each failed edit, narrowing to the final choice: annotate or annul. Escalation is causal: every attempted fix spawns a new disaster, raising the cost of intervention. The price is explicit—he must live with the original catastrophe and his growth from it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of guilt and epistemology: meaning is threshed, not erased. The pen’s reprise as testament rather than tool crystallizes the thematic shift. No moralizing; the final footnote is a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Ambiguity lingers—was the signal truly past or merely resonance—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, slightly austere, fitting a solitary interpreter. Syntax mirrors tension: longer sentences during frantic edits, clipped fragments at the moment of unbending. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Kaelen’s sensorium. Metaphor is restrained—spacetime “folds” rather than “weeps”—maintaining scientific tone while allowing emotional bleed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances character, concept, or atmosphere. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. “The gentle, persistent warping of spacetime was a constant pressure against his skin” does triple sensory, setting, and emotional work. Final cadence shift—“a profound stillness settled”—earns its quiet without slackening momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>The temporal-edit conceit is familiar, but its deployment through a signal interpreter’s guilt and the anomaly’s literal fold gives it fresh torque. The pen’s meteoritic iron and the gravitational cloister are specific, non-generic inflections. Risk is taken in the quiet, non-reversal ending, and it pays off by reconfiguring meaning rather than plot. No template echo.</comment>
