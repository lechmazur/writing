<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her breathing ritual, the tear freezing on her cheek—yet the “runaway dream” motivation is stated more than dramatized until the final image. The contradiction between her grounded craft and liminal ambition is present but not fully mined for tension. The earned stasis (she now knows how to read the map) carries visible cost in the shattered frost-mountains, satisfying the closure test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream is no longer runaway but a map she can read, with the felt cost of the crumbling frost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each breath adds density until the lattice forms, then dissolves. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One tightening beat suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, perpetual fog, and petrified stump are vivid and selective; the frost’s silver filigree directly enables the mirror ritual. Micro-setting (the stump as altar) constrains placement and charges the final image. Weather is not mere backdrop but the medium through which the boundary is erased.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recreate the lost dream—is signaled early and tightened when the frost begins to obey her breath. The cost is legible: the vision lasts only three breaths before shattering. Agency is high; coincidence does not intrude. One meaningful intensification meets the bar.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the permeability of boundaries between memory and matter, loss and legacy. The glass mountains image reweights the father’s failed ambition into a momentary triumph without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silent sextant and the tear that freezes rather than falls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control matching the breathing meditation. Perceptual signature is distinct: “the fog was a soft, grey wall, erasing the boundary between earth and sky.” No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. The final fragment “a tiny, perfect jewel of salt and sorrow and triumph” crystallizes emotion without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of mirror-making, astronomical longing, and breath-guided frost-sculpting feels fresh and inevitable. The transformation of a scientific instrument into a sympathetic conduit for dream-capture is a non-obvious angle that deepens theme. Risk in the lyric mode pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
