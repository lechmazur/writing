<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—ink’s taste of rust and salt, memory of the cliff—but contradictory impulses stay off-stage; her choices feel pre-ordained rather than wrestled. Motivation (“honor overlooked histories”) is stated, not embodied in a live dilemma. The final renunciation carries felt cost only by assertion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pattern of sensory density tightens toward the mural beat; closure is a Charged Poise—fragment’s weight reconfigures meaning. One transition (market → mural) is clean. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Market’s silk stalls, humming iron, floating lanterns are filtered through Lira’s translator gaze; each detail either guides her path (constellation-cracks) or reappears charged in the fragment. Final image of city lights as scattered stars loops back, earning resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake: retrieve fragment to mend a drowned world’s memory. Pressure escalates via sensory density and clue-tracing; cost is the memory she relinquishes to free the shard. No external antagonist; agency is attention and pattern-recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through overlooked detail emerges from action, not sermon. Final line’s “eternal instant” reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext lives in the weaver’s silence and the fragment’s heartbeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise: “tapestry of smoke,” “lighthouse beam cut through fog.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the mural, longer breaths in reflection. No POV drift; translator’s perceptual signature holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; metaphors interlock (constellation-cracks, woven shadows). One paraphrase loop (“between childhood and now” twice) barely grazes momentum. Final image crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fantasy market + memory-lens premise feels fresh; avoids generic quest beats. Risk lies in lyric compression rather than plot twists, and it pays off in the resonant ending.</comment>
