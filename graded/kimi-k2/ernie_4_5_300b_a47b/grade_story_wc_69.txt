<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s motivation to “save dying arts” is clear, but late‐story influx of new artists turns her into a facilitator rather than choosing agent, dampening earned cost; grandmother thread felt as sentimental prompt rather than active constraint. Still, her embodied listening and micro-choice to invite others earn moderate charge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis rather than decisive physical change; the final image of the rosette “spinning” is quietly resonant but cost feels collective rather than personally paid by Clara. Mild causality drift when world-events (“borders hardening”) are asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The velvet library, stained-glass leaf-light, and mother-of-pearl rosette are tactile micro-settings that physically shape sound and attention; autumn hush returns in final glow, grounding the closing image without scenery sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring vanishing arts—is declared, but pressure escalates by accumulation rather than narrowing; each new artist adds texture yet dilutes personal risk for Clara. External stakes (riots, borders) stay off-stage, softening urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of harmony through reclaimed sound emerges implicitly via zither/violin counterpoint. Subtext lands in Elias’s tremolo and Clara’s hummed braid; avoids sermon but edges toward thematic echo in final paragraph (“harmony is…art of holding gently”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-textural with velvet syntax, consistent POV and musical diction; occasional over-beauty (“music was not just sound but a language of the soul”) nudges elevated diction above Clara’s plausible thought register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is sensorily rich and rhythm-varied yet occasionally lapses into ornamental surplus (“gilded the dust motes”) that dilutes immediate propulsion; no loops or contradictory metaphors but thin scaffolding evident in abstract stock phrases near end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “song of exile” trope through accretive community score built of found instruments; zither/violin kinship offers fresh internal logic. Risk in quiet ending—no heroic rally—pays off in charged poise of golden rosette.</comment>
