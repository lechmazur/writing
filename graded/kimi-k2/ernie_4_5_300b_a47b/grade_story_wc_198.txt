<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to silence the prophecy yet fearing its truth—are embodied in the saxophone’s negative-space playing; the final renunciation costs him lingering doubt, earned by prior causality. Interiority is concrete, but the grandmother’s deathbed scene is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly blunting motive intensity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s refusal to let the prophecy finish forecloses the path of knowledge, with the cost of perpetual vigilance legible in the final image of the grotto “waiting.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; prism atrium’s color shift reweights the stake. Minor ellipsis around the figure’s origin is purposeful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism atrium and grotto are not mere backdrop; their refracted light and dripping metronome actively constrain Elias’s sonic tactics and charge the final image. Dewdrops as “tiny mirrors” crystallize the cost. Spatial choreography is clean; only the figure’s materialization lacks tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—is signaled early and tightened when the figure speaks; Elias’s agency drives the escalation via saxophone counter-music. Cost is visible in burning lungs and lingering unease. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-preservation emerges organically from Elias’s method and choice; the final image of secrets held “in the negative space between notes” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in the figure’s fraying voice is effective; slight risk of abstraction in “veil thins” line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elias’s perceptual bias—sound as absence, color as emotion. Syntax modulates with intensity; no head-hopping. Compression in “ghost’s whisper” is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Minor register lift in “vested hush” is voice-motivated. Rhythm accelerates during the climax without muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a saxophonist weaponizing silence against prophecy via architectural refraction. Negative-space music as anti-oracle is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
