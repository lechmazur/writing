<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s desire to “spin a prophecy into raw possibility” is stated early and revisited in the final image, but her interiority stays largely abstract; the button-sorting ritual shows quiet inspiration yet lacks a contradictory impulse or visible cost that would sharpen the final stance. The shift from passive listening to active cataloging is credible, but the emotional stakes feel muted because no personal flaw or fear is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the button cataloguing steadily intensifies the resonance of the jar until the canyon’s chorus crystallizes into a reweighted future. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Mara turns the hourglass, now seeing the future as a field to plant—whose cost is the irrevocable release of the echo into the world. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse’s dust, groaning beams, and sawdust floor are vivid and selective, filtering through Mara’s hushed attention. The jar itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image when she lifts it to the window. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlock the jar’s wisdom to reshape prophecy—tightens once: the chorus resolves into a directive that forecloses passive reception and demands active planting. The cost is the irreversible release of the echo, but the escalation is more textural than visceral; the price is felt conceptually rather than through immediate loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—history as raw material for an open future—emerges organically from the button-archive metaphor and the canyon’s message. No moralizing; the final image of Mara beginning “to catalog the next set of lost buttons” quietly reweights the premise without statement. Subtext is carried by silence, dust, and the hourglass’s slow fall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prose has a hushed, reverent texture—long sentences that breathe with the warehouse’s silence, then compress into short, decisive clauses at the turn. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices textures, scratches on buttons, the pulse of amber light. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; information is dense yet clear. A few near-repetitions (“quietly inspired” twice, “catalog the chaos”) are minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops; the figurative language (warehouse “groaning like ancient bones”) is purposeful and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hourglass-turner who reforges fate via lost buttons is a fresh synthesis; the canyon echo reframed as communal memory seeding the future feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmicks. The premise could not swap settings without collapsing its central metaphor.</comment>
