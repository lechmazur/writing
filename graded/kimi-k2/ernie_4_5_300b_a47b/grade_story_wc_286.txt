<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—calloused hands, still-water mind—and her micro-choice to place the lantern among the sunflowers crystallizes her shift from observer to caretaker of memory. The younger-self vision supplies a credible contradiction that justifies her departure with the warm glass. Cost is felt: she relinquishes the oasis’s shelter to carry its lesson forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Mara spinning clay beside the glowing glass reweights the entire timeline meditation. Causal chain—sunflower anomaly → lantern reaction → vision → recognition of anchored kindness—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skeletal hives, rusted pump, and improbable sunflowers are filtered through Mara’s potter-eye (“soil clings to life like clay on a wheel”), constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and light over cataloguing. Micro-setting—the lantern glass itself—functions as portable oasis.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why the oasis resists decay—tightens when the sunflowers’ impossible survival forces Mara to act. One decisive deepening: the vision reveals her own past planting, turning curiosity into custodianship. Cost is the abandonment of safe stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of kindness as temporal anchor emerges through the sunflowers’ endurance and the lantern’s glow; no explicit moralizing. Final image of spinning clay beside the pulsing glass offers non-literal answer: shaping time by tending inner light. Complexity preserved—wasteland still waits.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, potter-specific (“hands raw from digging wells instead of shaping clay”), rhythm modulates with the thrumming crescendo. No dialogue, so focus stays on perceptual signature. Compression taught early (“ghost of light”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured—“wind through barbed wire,” “jagged shadows danced like ghosts.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors stay coherent under physical logic. Final line anchors cadence and recharges lantern motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: phototropic kindness as literal physics of memory, wasteland beekeeping as temporal sanctuary. Risky lyric structure holds; transformation test passes—story fails without sunflowers’ specific anchor. No close echoes.</comment>
