<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is textured—her cedar-scented cloak, the way static feels under her fingertips—but her contradictory impulses (archive vs. share) stay mostly summary. The final beat of “carrying the stories inside her” is earned, yet the cost is soft; we see no forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the static fades, the alcove darkens, and Lira steps out carrying the fragments—an earned reconfiguration of her stance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lyric density tightens rather than pivots. Orientation is swift; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove’s iron-tasting air and bioluminescent veins are vivid and selective; the moss glow constrains visibility and mood, charging the final image when its light merges with the dial. Spatial choreography is clean; the mist behaves as a curtain, not décor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“teach dust to tell stories”—is signaled early and held. Pressure deepens lyrically as fragments accrue, but the tightening is tonal rather than tactical; no option is visibly foreclosed, so the cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: resurrection of lost voices through attentive listening. The final image of Lira as “pirate broadcaster in her own right” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the cloak’s lingering cedar and the static’s dying fall.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature tuned to sonic texture and faint light. Syntax modulates with intensity; no head-hopping. Compression (“static-laced frequencies of pirate broadcasts”) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the closing hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. No loops or scaffold. The final paragraph’s cadence—“the world was full of whispers, if you knew where to listen”—crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of orchestra copyist and pirate-radio archaeologist feels fresh; the “ghost bards” trope is transformed through Lira’s tactile craft. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative design, but it coheres. No close echoes detected.</comment>
