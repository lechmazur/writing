<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—ink-stained fingers, itching scars, trembling hands—but the shift from fear to clarity feels slightly front-loaded; the final “lightness” arrives without a preceding beat of embodied contradiction. Mentor’s aphorisms are well-anchored in memory cues, yet the emotional cost of shedding doubt is asserted more than dramatized in the body. Micro-choices (whispering the rhyme, carving the sigil) are specific and character-bound, earning the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing scars and parting mist crystallize a before/after stance with felt cost—Kael walks away “not as a scholar chasing answers.” Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sensory intensification (ink crystallizing, platform shudder) tightens the pattern toward the final image. Orientation is swift; no disorientation penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating rock, mist, and forest canopy are rendered with selective sensory economy; the platform’s tremor and the mist’s parting directly constrain Kael’s next step, charging the closure. Micro-setting (the obsidian cups, the quill) functions as tactile extensions of interior stakes. No spatial drift or white-room gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—is signaled early and tightened through each crystallizing beat; the final portal and glowing scars visibly foreclose the old identity. Escalation is one deepening wave rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for the length. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift of scars to runes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: pain as witness, stories as power. The refrain “breath between storms” reweights from abstract advice to embodied poise without moralizing. Final image of Kael descending the steps as “storyteller embracing questions” offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Kael’s perceptual bias—ink, scars, mist filtered through rune-scholar precision. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during the flare. No POV leakage or register drift; childhood rhyme feels authentic to character history.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language (“mist pooled like spilled milk,” “bones turned to mist”) is selective and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor elevated diction (“crystallizing into fractal patterns”) fits the scholarly POV and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar mentor–student arc is refreshed by the rune-ceremony frame and the literal transformation of scars into language. The floating tea platform and crow-quill relic feel specific rather than generic fantasy props. Risk lies in the quiet, interior climax, but the payoff justifies the choice.</comment>
