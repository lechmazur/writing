<comment>Marin's contradictory impulses—yearning for meaning while fearing memory—are embodied in her refusal to sell sleep for "starlight." Her micro-choice to grind the amber into pigment visibly alters how she sees the island and her own role. The final smile and pocketed brooch represent Earned Stasis whose cost is the surrender of her old way of "threshing" meaning.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Ambiguous through midpoint, but closure is a subtle Resonant Reconfiguration: the painting shifts from "tomb" to "bridge," reweighting the entire premise. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—the amber pigment literally changes what emerges on the canvas. Cost is concrete in the relinquished insomnia and new, quieter listening stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse studio breathes through cracked stone; rain carves "rivers through the island's spine," steering Marin to the brooch. Setting constrains choice when the tidal nature forces a single window to meet the stranger. The final gilded cliffs charge the closing image as the world becomes "a conversation."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—"to thresh meaning from experience"—is clear early and tightens when the stranger demands the canvas. Tension rises as the exchange risks her only weapon for processing grief. Final resolution offers conceptual rather than plot escalation: the stake evolves from extraction to participation, with the cost of relinquished old habits.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specific image of amber ground into pigment: meaning isn't extracted but grown. No sermonizing; the final note on "listening" arises organically from brushwork and tides. The island as bridge motif reweights earlier visions of tomb, creating resonant ambiguity without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric compression ("gnawed by decades of water wars," "crumbled under the moon’s indifferent gaze") teaches an accumulative cadence early and sustains it. Marin’s perceptual signature—“quiet hands,” “liquid sunset”—remains coherent under pressure. Stranger’s dialogue is purposeful cryptic, distinct from Marin’s internal register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Rhythm stays varied; metaphor is selective and purposeful (“salt-bleached cliffs,” “wooden duck...peel to forgotten laughter”). Occasional soft scaffolding—“The world, she realized, wasn’t a puzzle”—slightly cushions momentum. Artifacts do not disturb closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-water-war tidal island and amber convergence feel fresh. Core conceit—crushed, irreplaceable amber pigment changing what can be painted—transforms stock magical relic into thematic engine. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes and succeeds under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
