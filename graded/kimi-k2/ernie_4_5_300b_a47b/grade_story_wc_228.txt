<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—salt-smudged fingers, the weight of the shell—but the “promise to himself” remains abstract until the final beat; the contradiction between nostalgia and rebellion is shown more than felt in scene. Micro-choice at the pool (placing shell, beginning to draw) crystallizes values, yet the cost is gentle rather than irreversible. Still, the arc from cracked mirror to cavern peace is coherent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wrong turn into the cave reframes the mirror’s fracture into a source of light, and the sketch beside the pool makes the “temporary eternity” tangible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer (salt, shell, reflected roof) deepens the stake until the final image reweights it. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harbor salt, limestone damp, and the fissured ceiling are filtered through Elias’s painter’s eye; the pool’s symmetry literally guides his final sketch, satisfying the 9+ gate. Micro-setting (the shell in his pocket) functions as extension of body and memory. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with time’s fractures—is signaled early via the cracked mirror. Pressure tightens once: the wrong turn forces a stance crystallization in the cavern. Cost is conceptual (he forfeits the safety of never returning) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in the broken” emerges organically from shell, mirror, and reflected cave roof; no moralizing. The final image—sketch beside pool—offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to hold the temporary. Subtext resides in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual palette—colors, salt, weight of shell—without head-hop. Syntax modulates with emotional pitch; short clauses under pressure (“He froze.”) then longer, painterly cadences. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or interior motion. Occasional soft filter (“felt intimately aloof”) is minor. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, accelerating into the cavern, easing at the pool.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The wrong-turn-into-oasis frame is familiar, but the painter’s synesthetic lens and the mother’s seashell as “temporary eternity” give it fresh inflection. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, yet specificity of sensory palette elevates the trope.</comment>
