<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias’s astonishment registers only at the start; his interiority remains abstract, never directing a tangible choice. He functions more as passive observer than agent of turns, but the ghost-whispers do prompt his single dramatic act of speech, so the arc pins to that turn [Score hinges on one clear earned beat].</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc driven by situational pressure: ghost visitations tighten until the covenant resolves through Elias’s spoken release of trapped voices, a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands cleanly with on-page cost—shattered glass and dissipated ghosts—anchored by prior causal set-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Wasteland heat and derelict hives provide micro-setting pressure; the cracked hive-frames and powdered honey physically shape Elias’s trek and thematic decay. The hut and box anchor the climax, though environmental mechanics don’t constrain tactics beyond sensory grit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Central conflict is the covenant that utterance must free the unheard; escalation flows from ghost coercion to the final spoken words. The stakes crystallize when Elias must risk his vow of silence to discharge the ghosts, narrowing options effectively at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid words reaches closure through silent promise re-perceived as imprisoning, urging the breach of silence. Subtext—a refusal that costs the box—offers resonant ambiguity without overt moralizing; final shard-image reweights silence as burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tight third-person limited POV; ghost whispers inherit Elias’s muted register, though occasional placid omniscience slips. Syntax favors controlled lyric compression until final cry of release, maintaining perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (powdered honey under nails, sun-blinding glass) drives momentum. Density is clean; minor stock phrasing about “coils of silence” but no loop artifacts that obscure cause/effect at closure. Read-aloud rhythm accelerates into climactic utterance.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Abandoned beekeeping as mutely eloquent ruin is fresh lens for ghost-pact fable; tranformed covenant infuses the genre. Synthesis feels inevitable, turning silence to spoken catharsis without gimmicks. Specificity of vintage glass shards charging final image signals risk that lands.</comment>
