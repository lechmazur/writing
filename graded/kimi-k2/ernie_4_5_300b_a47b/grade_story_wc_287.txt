<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s desire to “reflect light” stays anchored in tactile micro-choices: coaxing jasmine, tapping the gauge cadence into the dock planks, pushing open Mara’s shutter. Interiority stays embodied—salt smell, metal chill—not label-speak. The final stance crystallizes at cost: the gardener accepts remaining a tender outsider, visible when Mara closes her eyes but does not yet smile. All interior conflict is enacted, never summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: the harbor, tool, moonlight, and widow absorb each gentle insistence until the dock rhythm coalesces into a resonant reconfiguration—Mara’s shutter ajar, cost registered in Elias’s lingering isolation. Causality is loose but coherent under that lens; no orientation or prop drift. Closure lands “outside...the harbor breathed,” a charged poise that re-weighs the prior beats without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Harbor moonlight, salt diesel, iron fire-escape groans, jasmine and geranium texture—all felt through Elias’s gardener perceptions, never staged as exposition. The bitting gauge tooth serves as micro-setting handled at pulse and fingertip across beats. Spatial anchor is immediate; only a slight dip under 8 reflects the fairly expected moon-dock palette rather than a constraining surprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore Mara’s capacity to receive light without forcing premature cheer. Escalation is low-voltage yet cumulative: tapping cadence → open window → accepting tool. Cost registered in Elias’s vulnerable leave-taking. Enough for this length; not a dramatic pry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of gentle persistence against emotional erosion emerges through images—rose, gauge tooth, dock rhythm—rather than stated thesis. Final resonance resides in Mara’s parted lips “as if afraid to let too much light in.” Ambiguity honors complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person limited to Elias stays consistent; rhythmic control—“quivering hush,” “metallic beat”—mirrors internal pulse. Dialogue minimal but credible: Mara’s single rough “Why?” carries subtext. No register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Clean, muscular prose; each sentence performs dual labor. No synonym loops nor mixed metaphors. Small over-color at “luminous” repeats but within tolerance; momentum never stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Gardener on fire-escape tending micro blooms is fresh; fusion with lock-bitting rhythm to unlock grief is specific and grounded. The widow-red-geranium beat flirts with trope but is reweighted by the gauge gift. Enough.</comment>
