<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—arrowhead’s warmth, bird-pattern epiphany—but the shift from “decades of failure” to instant comprehension feels under-motivated; no embodied contradiction is dramatized mid-scene. The final renunciation (descending the tower) is credible yet the cost is more asserted than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s new stance crystallizes in the final image (descending while pulse guides). Orientation is clear by 80 words; causality holds via pattern recognition → reconfiguration of stillness. Cost is implied in leaving ancestral perch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the arrowhead’s vibration; the setting constrains the final choice—he must descend. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: mastering “navigation without moving.” Escalation is textural: figure-eight birds tighten the pattern, arrowhead’s pulse reweights the paradox. Cost is legible—he abandons the tower—but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as alignment, not stasis. Final image reframes ancestral quest without moralizing. Subtext in birds’ silence and arrowhead’s glow is effective; ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature (heat of arrowhead, echo cadence) is distinct. No POV drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences in reflection, clipped descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“relic of ages past”) slightly drifts from Kael’s lived lexicon. No loops or scaffold. Strong sensory specificity anchors each beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: harmonic stone-skimmer + bird-pattern navigation + paradox of stillness. Premise commits fully; no retreat into cliché. Risk lies in quiet closure, but coherence justifies it.</comment>
