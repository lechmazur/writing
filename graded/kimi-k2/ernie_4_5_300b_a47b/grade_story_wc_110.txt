<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet meticulousness is embodied in concrete micro-choices (sorting tickets, fetching lens) and his interior contradiction—fear of silence vs. curiosity—drives the arc. The shift from passive observer to active translator is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: he abandons written logs for silent doodles. Lira remains a catalyst rather than a crucible, limiting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: ticket → lens → map → meeting → decoding loop. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s new role as “translator of silence” forecloses the old registrar identity; the blank ticket “Begin” crystallizes options with felt cost—his silence now bears responsibility. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The forecourt’s post-rain crystals, slick stones, and vibrating hum are filtered through Elias’s registrar gaze; the projector lens becomes a micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory selection narrows under urgency—hum in chest, damp gleam at dawn—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias move from passive logging to active listening? Pressure tightens when the ticket’s map forces a decision; the crystals’ hum escalates stakes from curiosity to responsibility. Cost is visible: he forfeits the safety of written records. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—honesty beyond words—emerges through Elias’s embodied struggle with silence and the lens’s revelation of “unfinished conversations.” Subtext resides in doodles, vibrations, and the final blank ticket. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: silence becomes currency, not absence. Ambiguity lingers credibly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensory and cognitive lens; no head-hopping. Prose texture is quiet, precise, registrar-like: “breath visible,” “edges curled from humidity.” Dialogue is spare and subtextual—Lira’s “You’re late” carries history. Voice modulates under pressure: clipped questions, hushed awe at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no template cadence. Information density is high: “lens-shaped circle” compresses object and clue. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“hush was a canvas”—never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise—tickets as keys to post-verbal honesty—feels fresh yet inevitable. Crystals that hum after rain and a cracked projector lens as decoder avoid stock imagery. The transformation of a registrar into translator of silence is specific to Elias’s occupation. No close echoes of famous scenes; risk is coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
