<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses—clinging to secrecy while craving connection—are dramatized in her tactile tracing of chalk and trembling acceptance of the letter. The final resolve to teach children encodes a visible cost: perpetual self-erasure. Interiority is specific and embodied; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: the vendor’s taunt is generic and doesn’t pressure her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s choice to perpetuate her grandmother’s resistance reweights the arcade from marketplace to living archive. Causal chain—chalk fragment → fountain key → hologram—tightens options without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 50. No retroactive fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arcade’s refracted dawn light and solar-gel fountain actively constrain tactics: Lira must read light spectra to locate the compartment. Spatial choreography across balcony, stalls, and tiles is clean. Sensory hierarchy favors urgency—gloved fingers, textured paper—over tourist detail. One micro-slip: “honeyed streaks” edges purple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—decode the grandmother’s legacy—escalates through each chalk clue and tightens when the fountain key demands physical risk. Agency is continuous: every scan, dip, and insertion narrows options. Cost is palpable: Lira accepts lifelong anonymity. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of encoded memory emerges from concrete actions—chalk spirals, wax seals—never abstract assertion. Subtext in the carrier’s “synthetic yet warm” tone hints at shared complicity. Final image of chalk-wielding children offers non-literal answer: resistance is recursive pedagogy. One soft echo: “futuristic nostalgia” named in closing line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s perceptual bias—she notices vendor sneers but not their wares. Syntax flexes with pulse: clipped clauses under pressure, longer cadence in reflection. No head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtext-laden: “Still chasing ghosts, Vey?” carries social contempt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “clipboard’s screen bloomed with data” fuses action and information. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise—light “fractures” ties to code. One minor filter stack: “her breath hitched” could be tighter, but it lands within emotional compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-collapse courier network + sidewalk-cryptographic chalk + solar-gel fountain archive. Familiar tropes—vanished mentor, secret letter—are retooled through tactile code and kinetic clipboard. Risky structural gamble (nested puzzle) pays off with coherent closure. Specificity of “solar gel” and “synth-coffee” roots the future in lived texture.</comment>
