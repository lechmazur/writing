<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s kindly methodical nature is embodied in tactile micro-choices—mapping chases, caching, prying the grille—each revealing a hierarchy of values. The interior contradiction between invisibility and guardianship is present but compressed; the final “felt seen” turn is credible yet slightly rushed. No secondary character pressure on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tape fragments, caches, and hush builds density until the decoder’s hum crystallizes stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s stance reconfigured from ghost to messenger with visible cost (cache secrecy, future risk). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Library’s sapphire hush, warped floorboard, and mildew basement are filtered through Mara’s practiced attention; the decoder’s grime and hum become micro-setting that constrains her next cache. Spatial choreography is coherent; every sensory note either tightens stealth or foreshadows the machine. Environment charges the final image of “steady lights” against enduring hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming visible to help the unseen—tightens once when the tape’s message forces Mara to risk exposure by caching the decoder. Escalation is textural: each crawl, hum, and flicker increases the cost of remaining hidden. Agency is renunciation of absolute invisibility; price is future vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of unseen guardianship emerges from concrete acts of caching and decoding; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “steady lights” reweights the premise: invisibility is no longer refuge but responsibility. Subtext resides in silence, static, and the withheld cache map.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual signature—metallic paper scent, calloused fingers, screwdriver weight. Prose texture mirrors her methodical mind: measured cadence, selective sensory hierarchy. No dialogue; voice coherence sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Sentences are lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“sapphire hush,” “brittle as glass”) is sparse and purposeful. Opening and closing lines echo without redundancy. Minor filter verbs in one beat do not dull momentum.</comment>

<comment>Post-apocalyptic librarian guardian is fresh; tape-reel archive as time capsule subverts typical MacGuffin. Specificity of crawl-space cartography and decoder grime grounds the premise. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than spectacle; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
