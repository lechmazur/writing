<comment>Lira’s internal contradiction—refusal of violence vs cosmic need—grounds her choices; she shows trembling hands, laughter that alters her gravity-weighted body, and the micro-choice of pressing palm to door stitches her fear to action. Motivation stays character-anchored: pacifism is cost, not label. The earned moment comes when her own shadow work, not an external force, dissolves the darkness into light. Minor slippage: “gravitationally lighter” reads concept more than body, yet its link to joy vs fear feels coherent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal lens inferred and sustained. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—door opens, physics stabilises, Lira floats—but the cost is mostly conceptual: the locket shatters and the Tear is re-absorbed, not lost to Lira. One line—“You did not avoid the shadow, you wore it like a cloak”—ties the beat together. The causality is clean, the turn is on page, yet the reader would have welcomed a tangible price like memory-loss or bodily anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting of recycled-ship and chamber gardens is anchored early, constrained use appears: hull patches guide the need to mend, bioluminescent trees beyond the door set new stakes. “Fused asteroid metal” and “locket forged from collapsed star” are specific tools that charge the final image. No spatial drift or tourist catalog; the world evolves with events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save ship via open dimension—signals immediately. Pressure tightens as the dimmed locket narrows Lira to confront denied shadow; one meaningful escalation when door resistance yields. Cost is felt in Lira’s fear-laughter and shattered locket. Stays within single pressure point; meets scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The thematic question—“peace is engagement, not absence”—arises implicitly from action: sewing versus fixing, shadows dissolved versus denied. The final image (luminous garden invitation) reweights pacifist refusal, no moralising paragraph. Complexity is sustained; reader asked to weigh engagement vs escape without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Tight third-person lyric voice with controlled compression. Distinct perceptual bias: Lira notices “ghostly resolve,” “faint shimmer.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: fragmented sentence at door “She began to stitch. Not with needle...”. No head-hop; AI voice remains external chorus. Tiny register drift in “gravitational lighter” phrase feels academic but forgivable at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Elegant compression—every phrase advances setting or motive. Runs one paraphrase loop: “ghostly resolve” echoed shortly after. Otherwise vivid specificity, active verbs, no scaffolding. Final lines “garden...singing in gratitude” achieve cadence shift without purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms recycled-ship, pacifist android, and quantum gravity into living thematic alloy. Avoids stock tropes; “Kwan Yin’s Tear” and quantum shadow-work feel inevitable by end. Final inversion—mending=opening not closing—feels freshly earned. Zero familiarity echoes.</comment>
