<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s “elusive” trait is shown through his vanishing act and moon-rock debt, but the interior contradiction between jocularity and desperation is only sketched; the final grin feels more reported than earned. Lira’s pressure is clear, yet her own stakes remain off-page, muting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon rock’s flare reweights loneliness from plague to “space between,” with Elias’s lighter chest as felt cost. Causal chain holds—rock summons conductor, conductor reframes loneliness—though the ghost’s negotiation is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The station’s ivy-choked decay is vivid and tactile, constraining movement and breathing with the characters; the mural and signal lever charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the tunnel’s bioluminescent graffiti feels slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“cure for loneliness”—is signaled early and tightened when the conductor redefines it as language; Elias’s agency drives the offering of the rock. Cost is visible in the emptied hand and eased chest, though the ghost’s dismissal could carry sharper consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity emerges organically through the moon-rock exchange and the conductor’s “give, you take” credo, avoiding overt moralizing. The final reconfiguration invites reflection without tidy answers, letting the ivy’s lighter weight carry resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lean, wry, and consistent with Elias’s logistics-honed pragmatism; compression like “polite anarchy” is taught early and paid off. Dialogue carries subtext, though Lira’s diction occasionally converges with Elias’s under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and image-dense without purple drift; “ivy pulsed like a second heartbeat” is precise. Minor scaffold in “Minutes ticked by” could tighten, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The moon-rock-for-loneliness barter feels fresh, transforming disaster-relief logistics into metaphysical negotiation. Risky conceit commits fully; the conductor’s redefinition of loneliness as language is a non-obvious synthesis that lands inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
