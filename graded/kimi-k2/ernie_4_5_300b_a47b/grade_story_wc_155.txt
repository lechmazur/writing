<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulse—mourning versus resurrecting joy—drives every beat; the fresco fragment and light-painting are micro-choices that visibly cost her detachment and safety. The final grinning “Everything” is earned by prior causality and carries a felt price: the fog’s silence is permanently broken. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tight chest) and avoids label-speak. Secondary pressure from Marla is brief but sufficient to force Lira’s stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s undeveloped “film” is developed, reweighting the district from lost to found. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light, laughter, and memory increases until the fog thins. Causality is intact: because Lira displays the fragment, therefore the crowd revives, therefore she commits to a larger mural. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the irreversible breach of silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ruined greenhouse, peach-grove skeletons, and clinging fog are not backdrop; they constrain light sources and social reach, forcing Lira’s scavenger tactics. Micro-setting—the fresco shard in her pocket—becomes the final talisman that charges the closing image. Sensory selection is urgent: damp walls, weak sunbeams, moss-choked paths all filter through Lira’s practiced familiarity. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim joy from silence—is signaled early and tightens once: the display transforms private elegy into communal resurrection. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each added light-word and remembered story increases density until the fog literally thins. Cost is visible in Lira’s trembling and the irreversible exposure of her solitude. No coincidences resolve the conflict; the crowd’s revival is a direct consequence of her chosen action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: undeveloped memory must be risked to light. The exposed-film metaphor reweights the premise at closure without sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Marla’s cracked voice, children chasing firefly words. The final grinning “Everything” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic echo or moralizing summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “moss-choked paths,” “reckless, giddy hope,” syntax mirroring Lira’s half-dream state. Compression is taught early (“stones themselves had forgotten their purpose”) and paid off in the final line. No POV leakage; perception stays strictly Lira’s. Dialogue is sparse but natural—Marla’s crackling admission carries subtext and advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; only minor loops (“light-paintings,” “light-words”) and one mixed metaphor (“fold of a daydream”) keep it from 8.5. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines for fog, staccato beats for action. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold. Final image is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of light-painting, undeveloped film, and communal resurrection feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (ruined utopia, found art) are transformed through Lira’s specific practice and the orchard’s fog physics. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring clarity. The fresco fragment’s return as talisman is a non-obvious intensification.</comment>
