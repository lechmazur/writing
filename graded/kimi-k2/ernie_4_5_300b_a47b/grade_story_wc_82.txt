<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; grief is folded into tactile craft. Yet the brother’s absence is filtered through summary more than micro-choice, and the final stance (“I’m not afraid”) feels slightly ahead of earned causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief density increases until the lantern’s light reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cost is the ongoing tremble and the next shadow. One transition (workshop→garden) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Floating island, basilica spires, and bioluminescent moss are selective and sensory. The basilica’s paradoxical motion constrains the lantern maker’s ritual; the tea garden’s hush amplifies her isolation. Spatial anchors are clear by line 5.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into flight—tightens as each polish risks reopening loss. One meaningful deepening: the shadow’s return forces public confrontation. Cost is the visible tremor and the promise of perpetual folding.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transformation-through-grief emerges from craft and light, never sermonized. Final image of ascending paper cranes reweights the basilica’s paradox without moral. Subtext in “luminous torment” carries unresolved ache.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with consistent perceptual tilt—lavender smoke, moonstone weeping. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hop. Compression (“Dreams are just grief with wings”) is earned by prior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent under the fantasy lens. Minor loop: “polish until the stone weeps, then capture the light” echoes conceptually. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Folding grief into origami flight and a basilica that descends while ascending synthesize familiar tropes into fresh emotional geometry. Risky paradox is taught early and paid off at close.</comment>
