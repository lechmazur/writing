<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied fear and inherited dream are vivid; the scrimshaw’s warmth and her final laughter-through-tears crystallize the arc. Yet the father’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the generational weight that should drive her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: releasing the scrimshaw dissolves the island and reconfigures identity. The causal chain—violence → call → detach → freedom—holds under a Causal lens. One minor slack: the whale’s guardian status is asserted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The sublittoral fringe is tactile—wet sand, kelp dancers, bioluminescent murk—and the island’s crumbling edge constrains the final swim. Micro-setting (boots sinking, water lapping) anchors every beat; the whale’s eye becomes the charged final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“leaving becomes impossible to resist”—is signaled early and tightened when the island literally fractures. The cost is the obliteration of home; agency is the deliberate release of the scrimshaw. One escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of detachment-as-freedom emerges through action, not sermon: the island as mirror, the whale as keeper of secrets. The final swim into “deep, vast and full of possibility” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in dock-worker muscle memory; perceptual signature filters every detail through salt and labor. No head-hopping; diction remains within Lira’s lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“combative tenderness”) edges toward authorial flourish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; sensory detail is selective. One loop: “the whale’s call echoed in her mind, a promise of adventures yet to come” restates the prior beat without new pressure. Otherwise high density and no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The disappearing-island-as-mirror premise feels fresh; the whale guardian and scrimshaw key twist familiar maritime tropes into personal myth. Risk is moderate—lyric closure rather than spectacle—but specificity keeps it from template.</comment>
