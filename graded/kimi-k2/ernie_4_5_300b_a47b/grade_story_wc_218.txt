<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—acceptance of mortality vs. refusal to abandon the orchard—drive every micro-choice. The “gentle and systematic” trait constrains her tactics and shows cost when she chooses patience over speed. Final renunciation is earned: she gives her last breath to the orchard, foreclosing any other future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s pulse syncs with the oak, a visible before/after. Causal chain—copper wire conducts earth’s pulse, spirit accepts bridge—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is palpable in Lira’s final exhale, felt by orchard and reader.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Living stone pillars, copper-wrapped oak, and dappled light are selective, tactile, and constrain every move. Setting evolves: pillars lean closer, hum louder, finally glow—charging the final image. Micro-setting (oak as conduit) functions as character-level tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interspecies harmony before death—tightens once: spirit’s question “Why?” forces Lira to articulate the bridge’s cost. Escalation is one deepening beat; no reversals needed. Price is her remaining life, visible on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation between human and spirit architectures emerges from copper lattice and Lira’s last words, never stated. Final image reweights premise: pain as language, bridge as mutual scar. Complexity lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, tactile, rhythmic—“brazen calm” modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is caretaker-specific: noticing root tension, light angles, stone warmth. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; no loops or scaffold. Sentences vary rhythm with scene heat. Figurative language (“liquid sun”) is sparse, purposeful. Information density high: each line advances stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: copper-wired oak as living architecture, mortality as design constraint. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk—quiet botanical-fantasy hybrid—pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
