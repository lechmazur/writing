<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his fingertip on the torn map, the chill in his bones—and his curiosity is embodied in the brass sextant and stolen holy water. The final choice to listen rather than claim mastery is earned by the escalating hum and the visible shudder of the stones. Yet the grandfather’s journal functions more as prompt than crucible, and Elias’s flaws remain largely off-stage, keeping the arc from full contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (1923 vs drone footage, shifting carvings) tightens until the chapel’s warm silence reweights the premise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias reframes the map from border to invitation—felt in the final breath visible in still air. Causality is intact: each comparison of film frames materially widens the crack. Minor slack: the tear’s geography is never fully anchored, but the pattern coherence overrides it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The vault’s rain-scoured frescoes and the henge’s moss-buried stones are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s trained eye. The brass sextant functions as micro-setting, its precise angle aligning vault window to stone crack and literally opening the staircase. Weather stops on cue, but the henge’s faint glow persists, charging the final image. No orientation debt; geography remains legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—interpret silence with empathy—is signaled early via the journal’s “Reopen the silence.” Escalation is textural: each film reel adds density until the widening crack forces Elias to trade control for listening. Cost is visible—the stones grind apart, holy water spent, and the staircase into darkness forecloses retreat. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between mapping as mastery and listening as humility; the henge itself becomes a non-literal answer, reweighting silence from absence to language. Subtext resides in the shift of serpents’ eyes and fractured suns—guardianship replacing dominion. The final smile of the saints in the chapel frescoes offers a resonant, non-moralizing image. No thematic drift or overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and map-framer specific—“borders where others saw blankness,” “methodically curious.” Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for archival calm, clipped fragments under the hum’s crescendo. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. POV remains tightly focalized; no filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature—measuring angles, noting eroded saints—holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“broken halos,” “lullaby for the methodically curious.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“threshold,” “liturgy”) fits Elias’s scholarly lens. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of silent film archaeology and living henge feels fresh; the chapel is not mere ruin but resonant instrument. Tropes of mystical stones are transformed through empirical comparison of 1923 vs drone footage. The risk—equating silence with language—pays off via embodied cost (stolen holy water, grinding stones). No close echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
