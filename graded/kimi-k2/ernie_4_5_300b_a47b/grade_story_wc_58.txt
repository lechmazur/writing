<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is rich, contradictory, and embodied (e.g., ink-stained fingers embracing moss), but her decisive “choice” to walk away is foregone rather than forged—no visible alternative path or cost appears on the page before she smiles. Hence the motivation feels slightly pre-ordained rather than earned by crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silence-grief threads accruing). Closure as Charged Poise in final image (“walked into the fading light, parchment cradled”) is legible and resonant, yet the cost remains aesthetic-lonesome with no new consequence actually shown—weight is felt, but lightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden shadow, jasmine scent, and the silver thread are tactically present: scent anchors time-slip, thread literally guides her return path. Still, the autumn weather doesn’t tighten her choices; environment decorates rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the geography of healing”—is clear, and the thread’s hum momentarily narrows her focus. Yet pressure remains ambient; the missing woman poses no concrete obstacle or demand, so escalation is atmospheric rather than option-changing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of absence-into-presence ripens organically through Elara’s act of writing, yet the final evocation of “explained absences” edges close to explicit (East-paragraph). Overall complexity preserved; moral keeps the ambivalence alive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, compressed, and lyrical: “map the fractures in souls before they shattered” reads as Elara’s DNA. Syntax modulates (breathy exposition → clipped real-time notes) without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level craft is highly polished—rare redundancy, vivid nouns. Minor figurative layering around “river of thread”/“poem of syllables” borders excess but never obstructs clarity or closure moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: vision-quest obituary writing felt across ghost-weft memory net. Derivative layers (haunted-garden trope, autumn stock) are ennobled by procedural specificity of writing on the thread.</comment>
