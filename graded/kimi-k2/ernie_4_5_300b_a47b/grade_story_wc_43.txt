<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—“frayed edge of a broken vinyl,” “scent of lavender and hope”—but the “flawless goodbye” motivation is stated rather than dramatized until the final gift of the shard. The mother-backstory is brief and alters present tactics, satisfying BRR. Elias’s single spoken line and Clara’s anchor-grip create a believable crucible, though status dynamics remain muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (vinyl crackle, hymn swell, sky bleed) tightens the emotional density toward the Earned Stasis of Elias’s last breath and the shard’s bequest. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure image—“radiant haven seemed to hum”—reconfigures meaning with felt cost: Mira’s perpetual return to loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-settings—vinyl shard, lavender air, sky-high hospice—constrain choices: the elevated haven isolates, the record’s physical damage forces imperfection, scent cues transition from fear to acceptance. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Could edge higher if the haven’s architecture actively shaped tactics beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: deliver a flawless goodbye before Elias dies. Tightening occurs when the vinyl skips and Elias’s voice strengthens, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is visible: Clara’s sobs, Mira’s aching chest, the shard’s transfer. Agency rests in Mira’s steady holding of space; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of music as alchemical bridge emerges through action, not assertion. Subtext lives in gesture—Clara’s forehead against her father’s, Mira’s pocketed fragment. Final image of the haven “breathing with memory” offers resonant reweighting without moralizing. Minor risk of sentimentality is offset by the shard’s tangible transfer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “pulsing stillness,” “hymning the mundane.” POV remains tightly focalized through Mira; no head-hop. Dialogue is spare and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at death, longer lyric lifts after. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“alchemical,” “reunification”) is earned by context. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. High information density without clutter. A single “radiant haven” repetition is purposeful cadence, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar hospice-music trope is refreshed by the shard as living relic and “hymning the mundane” as therapeutic praxis. Specificity of scent-memory and cloud-level hospice lifts it above cliché. No famous-line echoes. Slight risk of middle-ground safety keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>
