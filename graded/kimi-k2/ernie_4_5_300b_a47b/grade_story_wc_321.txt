<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s resilient optimism is embodied in micro-choices—tightening grip on the railing, steadying his voice on the radio—until the final renunciation when he accepts erasure as ferry-keeper. Interiority stays concrete; the tear-streaked smile crystallizes cost without sentimentality. One slip: “resiliently positive grin faltered” edges toward label-speak mid-climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ferry dissolves, timelines merge, Kael stands alone with new constellation overhead—felt cost is the permanent loss of purpose. Causal chain holds: empty hourglass → radio pattern → prism beam → merged lives. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift. Minor ellipsis in how “interconnected patterns” translate to tones is tolerated under lyric lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The spectral grotto’s bioluminescent veins literally guide Kael’s tuning of the radio; starlight prism at climax reconfigures the sky into the Hourglass constellation, charging the final image. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—flickering fungi, hollow echo—mirroring Kael’s narrowed options. One brief spatial fuzz when ferry “slides sideways” without tactile cue, but it serves disorientation that closure redeems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—merge timelines or abandon passengers—signaled early via Lira’s warning. Escalation tightens once: static resolves into coherent plea, forcing Kael’s irrevocable broadcast. Cost is the ferry’s dissolution and his own unhousing. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of completion-over-salvation emerges through specific fates of widow, child, lover; no moralizing. Final constellation reweights the empty hourglass from loss to eternal vessel without explicit statement. Subtext in radio static—voices pleading for merger—carries more weight than any dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter; diction skews maritime and cosmic (“spectral grotto,” “liquid starlight”) without purple drift. Rhythm accelerates during broadcast sequence, then exhales into the quiet final walk. No head-hopping; spectral captain Lira remains external.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “wood and rope unraveling into strands of light” compresses dissolution and wonder. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor—“sand… spilling outward to weave the timelines”—is forgiven for conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Ferry-as-bridge-between-worlds is familiar, but the empty hourglass as vessel for “echoes of time” and the radio-as-pattern-translator feel freshly synthesized. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off in the constellation closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
