<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied (“fingers tracing the rim,” “breath caught”), but the moment of self-confrontation (“darkness within himself”) is asserted rather than dramatized. The final choice to enter the warehouse is motivated, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. Secondary pressure from the captain is present but too brief to act as crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s shadow reweights the entire quest from place to epistemic stance. Causal chain holds—sundial → shadow → warehouse → blueprint—with one clean transition off the barge. Cost is conceptual (loss of naïve legend-hunting) and is legible in the final image of dawn over the canal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Twilight canal is rendered with selective sensory strokes (“liquid silver,” “muddy banks”) that mirror Elias’s liminal state. Warehouse interior supplies micro-setting pressure: the flickering lantern and spilled documents narrow his options. The sundial itself functions as portable setting that constrains movement and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unraveling the architecture of lies—is signaled early and tightened when the blueprint reveals a literal machine for narrative control. One meaningful escalation: the sundial’s shadow pivots from celestial guide to ideological compass, foreclosing the simpler treasure hunt. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the dawn-light realization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete discovery of the propaganda machine; no explicit moralizing. The sundial’s inscription and final reorientation embody the theme without stating it. Subtext in the captain’s warning (“poking at shadows”) resonates retroactively after Elias sees the blueprint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“serene upheaval,” “quiet reassurance”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices like a man who deciphers for a living. No POV drift; compression in the warehouse paragraph accelerates tension effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“epistemic stance,” “architecture of lies”) fits the scholarly POV. One paraphrase loop (“he’d spent years…”) is minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter; final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The legend-seeker trope is refreshed by reframing the quest as epistemological rather than geographical. The sundial-as-compass-for-truth is a fresh inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged dawn image.</comment>
