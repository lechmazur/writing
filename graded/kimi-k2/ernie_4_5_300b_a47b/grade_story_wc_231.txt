<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven obsession with borrowed memories is vivid, but the woman’s sudden appearance and instant confession undercut her agency and the relationship crucible. Interiority is strong—his “storm-cloud” eyes and seaweed beard are specific—but the final promise to “return them” feels unearned because we never see the mechanism or cost. The contradictory impulse (carry vs. release) is stated rather than dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias vows to restore memories, reweighting his lifelong isolation. Causal lens holds—each beat (finding flower → meeting woman → opening trunk) links by “therefore.” Cost is implied but not viscerally on the page, keeping it below 9. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The opal dock’s mist and salt-slick planks constrain movement and hide the hatch, directly enabling the discovery. Sensory detail is selective—bruise-purple sky, cobweb mist—and filtered through Elias’s maritime gaze. The Edelweiss reappears in the final image, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when the trunk reveals the captain’s guilt. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elias shifts from observer to active restorer. Cost is conceptual (accepting shared burden) but not yet viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of isolation as “carrying what isn’t yours” emerges organically from Elias’s choice to shoulder the woman’s loss. Subtext in the boutonnière’s reprise avoids moralizing. Final image reframes isolation as communal responsibility without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and maritime—gulls, hymns, seaweed beard—with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but rasped and goal-driven (“You’re here for the memories”). Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with only one minor loop (“salt and mist that clung like cobwebs” followed by “mist clung”). Metaphors are coherent and purposeful. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The borrowed-memory conceit is freshly grounded in maritime grief rather than generic sci-fi. Edelweiss as confession token transforms a familiar alpine symbol into maritime penance. Specificity of lighthouse keeper’s vocation and dock setting prevents template drift.</comment>
