<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her trembling moth-wing hands, the shell pressed to her chest—but the final “understanding” is articulated rather than dramatized, softening the cost. Motivation is clear and consistent; the micro-choice to blow the shell like a flute crystallizes her stance. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s shift from mechanized order to wild responsiveness is legible and irreversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers sensory density until the geyser of light reweights the world. Cost is visible in the snapped string and bleeding fingers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s metallic peaches and glass sky-bridge are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the locust shell functions as micro-setting that constrains Lira’s signaling method. The final eruption of starlight recharges every prior image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory insurgency. The statues’ cracking knees and flickering cores provide visible, escalating cost under the Accumulative lens. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mechanized control versus wild beauty, resolved by letting go of control itself. The final image of the orchard answering Lira’s lullaby reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo in prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent—“peaches glowed like captured sunsets,” “grass hummed with forgotten hymns.” Rhythm modulates with pressure, and no head-hopping occurs. Experimental compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final sentence—“The orchard listened. This time, it answered.”—lands with crystalline cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of living statues, heart-rhythm signaling, and tarnished wonder feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: the story would collapse if any core element were swapped.</comment>
