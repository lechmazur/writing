<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her pulse quickens, her fingers tremble—but the contradiction between duty and obsession is stated more than dramatized. The final resolve is credible, yet the cost is more declared (“she was already gone”) than embodied. Hale’s presence supplies external pressure, but his oily menace is generic, muting the crucible effect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (numbers → deleted files → coordinates) tightens options until the upload act forecloses retreat. Closure is a decisive change—Lira escapes into the unknown with the coordinates—yet the felt cost is slightly abstract; the drones’ red lights suggest danger more than exact consequence. Orientation is swift; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive’s cold glow and humming servers anchor place early; the patch’s rough fabric under fingertips reappears to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—light, texture, static—filtered through Lira’s urgency. The derelict station remains off-stage, so environment never constrains the final choice; cap holds at 7.6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering Elara’s fate—escalates as each decoded clue narrows Lira’s options. The tightening is clear: from open search to locked coordinates to imminent capture. Cost is visible in the blaring alarms and Hale’s threat, though the price of escape is still more potential than paid. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory versus erasure emerges organically through deleted files, ghostly footprints, and the patch’s survival. Subtext in Hale’s “sentimental value” line carries the corporate lie. Final image of Lira racing toward the edge reweights the premise without moralizing, though the resonance could cut deeper if Elara’s voice had echoed once more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is crisp, tech-noir tinged—“oily with false sympathy,” “ghostly impressions in the system’s memory.” POV stays tight to Lira; no head-hop. Compression is purposeful—ellipses in transmissions, fragmented logs—taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sensed absence of information”) edges toward register drift but remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose propels: sentence lengths vary with tension, clauses stacked for urgency. No loops or scaffold; each line advances. Metaphors are spare and apt—“footprints in snow.” Minor filter verbs appear but do not cluster. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips. High density without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Combines cold-case mystery with data-archive noir in a fresh synthesis; the “gateway as deletion” concept reweights familiar tropes. Recurring numbers feel inevitable once revealed. Risk lies in the compressed escape, but coherence holds. Specificity of corporate memory-keeping grounds the speculative frame.</comment>
