<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s interiority is vivid—her trembling fingers, synchronized breath, and exhaustion all embody stakes. The contradiction between her embalmer’s precision and artist’s intuition surfaces in the embellishment gamble, forcing a visible cost (cracks seal only after she risks the grotto). Motivation stays rooted: preserve Elion’s echo or lose it. The final slump and smile crystallize earned stasis with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald’s steady glow and sealed cracks mark a before/after for both Elion’s echo and the grotto’s fate. Causal chain holds—each embellishment stroke directly counters the fissuring pool. Cost is legible in Lirael’s exhaustion and the grotto’s near-collapse. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensification (aurora kiss, lullaby absorption) reweights stakes without external reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The skyborne grotto’s crystalline walls, bioluminescent moss, and liquid-starlight pool are not backdrop; the pool’s cracking directly constrains Lirael’s tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy—aurora pulses, obsidian runes—mirrors her heartbeat and stakes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from kneeling to rising. Environment functions as micro-setting that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save Elion’s echo—signals early and tightens when the pool begins to fracture. One meaningful deepening: realization that the threshold is a lens amplifies her options but raises cost. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Price is visible in her exhaustion and the grotto’s near-loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of beauty enduring oblivion emerges through concrete particulars: emerald sphere, lullaby, aurora kiss. No moralizing; final image reweights premise without statement. Subtext in the “radiant hush” and the kiss of light invites reflection on preservation’s cost. Complexity lingers—beauty bought with fragility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, selective sensory catalog, and rhythmic control under pressure. “Lucidly watchful” is embodied in her precise micro-choices and synchronized breath. No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Syntax modulates with tension, accelerating during cracks, softening at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful—“threads through a loom,” “kiss of light”—and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; information multi-tasks. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of beautician-mortician with celestial embalming is fresh; no template match. Emerald chip as memory phylactery, threshold as lens, lullaby as stabilizer—all specific to this world. Risk in embellishment gamble pays off. Transformation test fails: story collapses if any element swapped.</comment>
