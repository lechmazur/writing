<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her chest tightened,” “seed grew warm”), and her contradictory impulse—doubt that memory may not be worth saving—drives the climax. Yet the moment of resolve feels slightly under-costed; the seed vanishes and the air “thrums,” but no concrete forfeiture or bodily price is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s doubt is transmuted into resolve, the ridge’s memory is “safe, for now,” and the monsoon shifts from threat to renewal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory intensification reweights the stake—though the final beat could sharpen the felt cost with one visceral image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ridge is rendered in selective, urgent detail (“violets bled into golds,” “scent of jasmine and iron”) that tightens with pressure. The seed-as-micro-setting constrains her choice in the dream-cavern, but the environment itself does not physically limit her final action, keeping it just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting collective memory from monsoon oblivion—is signaled early and escalates through sensory intensification and the dream-fracture. A single decisive tightening occurs when Lira chooses to confront fear and re-enter the dream, but the on-page cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as compass, not cage, and the courage to remember pain. The final image of the monsoon-as-beginning reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the mirrors’ liquid light and the woman’s chorus-voice deepens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“colors deepened, and the air thickened”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira’s noticing is tactile and synesthetic. No head-hopping or register drift; the dream-cavern’s surrealism is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Minor figurative excess (“mosaic of color,” “empirically whimsical beauty”) slightly dilutes peak beats, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure. High information density with clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-entity memory repair, botanical magic, and lyrical eco-fantasy feels fresh. The “knowledge fruit seed” and “island’s first dreamer” transform familiar tropes through embodied stakes. One fresh inflection: memory-fracture as living mirror-shards that melt into choice.</comment>
