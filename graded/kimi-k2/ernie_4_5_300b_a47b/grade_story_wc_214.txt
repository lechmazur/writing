<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Zara’s interiority is vivid—her empathy with the star’s death is embodied in the kneel and lantern placement—but her “cosmic janitor” role is ornamental; no tool or duty constrains her choice. The moment of letting-go lands, yet the prior causality is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s dimmed glow plus captured stardust crystallizes Zara’s stance with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence and light reweights the premise—but the middle lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plateau’s obsidian shards and aurora are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Zara’s internal fracture. The station itself is sketched more than used, yet the lantern glass steps in as micro-setting that constrains the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early; the star’s death provides one deepening pulse. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed until the final image, keeping pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from Zara’s act of listening and release; the final lantern image reweights “flourishing stillness” without moralizing. Subtext in Veyra’s cracked silence enriches the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature rooted in cosmic patience. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hop or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“primal elegance”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-janitor conceit freshens the familiar star-gazer trope; the fusion of spiritual curiosity with maintenance labor feels specific. Risk is moderate—quiet lyricism over plot pyrotechnics—but the synthesis is coherent.</comment>
