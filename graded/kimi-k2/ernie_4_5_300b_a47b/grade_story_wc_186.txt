<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s retrocognitive gift and her bleeding fingers give visceral cost; her stubborn hope is embodied in every shard she aligns. The interior contradiction—doubt vs. faith—drives each micro-choice, culminating in the earned stasis of “that was enough.” Secondary characters remain off-page, so relationship crucible is N/A. Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s song re-opens the sky, cost paid in blood and solitude. Causal chain—shard → alignment → storm-refraction → rekindling—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; mosaic shards are legible transitions. One tightening beat suffices for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass pavilion is not backdrop but instrument: its walls vibrate, its mosaic floor dictates star paths, its apex receives the decisive moonbeam. Dust, wind, and refracted light constrain every move. Micro-setting (the shard in her palm) doubles as tool and wound. Sensory hierarchy is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the beacon to shatter the hush—is signaled early and tightened when the storm threatens to erase progress. Agency is continuous: each alignment narrows options until the final slam of shard into mosaic forecloses retreat. Cost is visible (blood, isolation) and felt. Coincidence (moonbeam) complicates, not resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action: shards of memory reassemble into collective hope. The prism’s shift from guide-ships to remind-world reweights meaning without moralizing. Subtext lives in the glass’s hum—beauty after collapse. Final image (“that was enough”) offers quiet conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature is tactile and star-haunted. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during storm, longer breaths in reflection. No dialogue, so no register clash. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats. Patterned elision (visions) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“slammed,” “shivered”) replace modifiers. Opening and closing lines frame the arc with sonic precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon rekindling is familiar, yet the retrocognitive custodian, glass pavilion as instrument, and “shard of hush” concept synthesize into fresh emotional logic. Transformation test fails if names change—specificity is high. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
