<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's odd-historian craving to rescue forgotten stories is vividly embodied; micro-choices (kneeling, trembling, palm to wall) show contradiction between collector’s urge and fear of dragon-awakened silence. His interior monologue stays concrete through embodied perception rather than labels. Cost crystallises when the wall’s chorus rises: he has retrieved the collective dream but must now bear its constant mutter. One deduction for slight competence inflation—his instant decoding of tapestry runes feels frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The closure (dragons unfurl / wall chorus) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s listening stance becomes irreversible and his solitude is redefined into stewardship. Plot linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each recovered shard adds charge until the final vibration. Time and space anchoring is swift. Causality intact, cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The silo is sensuously specific—rust-ribs, ash-smell, railroad-spike weights—without cataloguing. Crucially, the space itself becomes agent: vibrations funneling stories into Elias’s bones. The hearth and steel wall double as constraining tools that channel closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve or lose the dragon stories—clarifies early and tightens when Clara’s “axis shifted” threat surfaces. One clear deepening occurs when Elias realises the displacement is perceptual, not spatial, forcing the final act of acknowledgment. Cost is palpable in the ending thrum. A soft beat: smoke-carrying ritual summarised not dramatised, sapping maximal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—how collective forgetting rewrites reality—emerges through accumulation of shards, tapestry stitches, and literal rising voices. Final image answers the central question without sermon. Resonant ambiguity: is the chorus salvation or haunting? No late thematic echoing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is atmospheric but knife-lean: “steel ribs rusting into the earth like the bones of a forgotten god” sets both texture and POV. Distinct perceptual signature tracks what Elias’s scholar-hand chooses to notice. Rhythmic control tightens under the humming climax without head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythms pulse—long reflective coils, then staccato hearth-probing. Occasional mild overwriting (“dying leaves” echo) clipped. Clarity and cadence sustain through the final resonant thrum. No loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The silo-as-library premise is fresh; dragons as metaphors for stifled stories is transformed into literal embroidery that reanimates. Specificity and stakes elevate familiar tropes. One minor deduction for the near-stock “bones of a forgotten god” opener; originality otherwise rings sharp.</comment>
