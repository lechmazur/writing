<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her peripheral awareness and scars anchor her—but the prophet remains a cipher; their relationship lacks crucible pressure. The “strangely honest” trait is shown only once (mask slip & laugh) and never complicates tactics. Closure choice (anchor the clearings) is earned, yet cost is diffuse rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds; orientation is swift and causal linkage (“prophet arrives → consecration ritual”) is legible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—wisdom echo secured, line endures—yet the prophet’s unexplained catalyst weakens the final beat’s felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Whisperfield dunes, kinetic parapet, and murmuring pavilion are tactile and selective; the parapet’s spiral ascent constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors Mara’s biased attention; world rules stay consistent. Final image of glowing clearings recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echo—is signaled early and tightened through ritual escalation. Agency is joint, but Mara’s peripheral awareness drives the decisive anchor. Cost is conceptual (line’s perpetual burden) rather than visceral, slightly muting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship versus revelation emerges through action; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in mask removal and prophet’s recoil deepens ambiguity. Final silence of pavilion offers resonant, non-literal answer: wisdom preserved, watcher bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s perceptual signature; diction is lyrical yet disciplined. Prophet’s chant is the only voiced dialogue and carries ritual weight. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under ritual pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“voices coiling like smoke”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught early. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance stakes or atmosphere. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of kinetic architecture and memory-clearings feels fresh; prophet/walker dyad avoids stock roles. Whisperfield calm as tonal constant is a subtle risk that pays off. Premise could border on familiar mystic-ritual territory but gains specificity through embodied parapet mechanics.</comment>
