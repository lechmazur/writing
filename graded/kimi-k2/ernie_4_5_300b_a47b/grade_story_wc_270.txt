<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nana Marisol’s insurgent past and plant-telepathy are sketched vividly and anchored in micro-choices (kneeling to trace symbols, blistering hands). The final planting of the embryo crystallizes her arc—tradition evolved, not abandoned—with felt cost in the glowing soil. Interiority is specific, though the “accidental telepathy” label edges toward convenient shorthand rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: kite discovery → plant decoding → dig → hatch → choice to plant. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—future branches reweighted by her act, cost legible in the shuddering springs. One minor ellipsis: how she instantly knows the spiral symbol matches the lock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Volcanic hot springs are rendered with tactile heat, sulfurous scent, and moss-slick rock; the setting actively constrains digging time (“before the drones return”) and supplies the womb-like cradle for the embryo. Final image of glowing water recharges the opening steam.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—evolve tradition or repeat control—tightens when the embryo’s open futures are revealed. One decisive turn: she chooses planting over possession, narrowing options with visible cost (blistered hands, possible crew backlash). Pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of intentional evolution emerges through action, not sermon: the embryo as seed, not weapon. Final glow reframes earlier ruins and kite glyphs without moralizing. Subtle tension between healing and control lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and age-true (“battered straw hat,” “moss-slick rock”). Compression and sensory bias reflect Nana’s priorities. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal monologue avoids filter overload.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; figurative language (“cauldron,” “wounded bird”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“steam curled around her ankles” followed by “water bubbled and hissed”—but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: insurgent botanist grandmother decoding plant-whispered glyphs to midwife a post-regime future. Risky telepathy handled with restraint; embryo trope inverted from weapon to seed. Specificity of volcanic springs anchors universals.</comment>
