<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cedar’s molting trait is embodied in trembling hands and shifting eyes, but the monthly mechanic is asserted more than dramatized; the final acceptance of chaos is earned through the discovered poem, yet the cost feels generalized rather than specific to this molt. Marla’s presence supplies relational pressure, but her daughter’s mention is a late graft that doesn’t bend Cedar’s choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Cedar’s realization that growth means inhabiting anarchy, not fleeing it, crystallizes in the new poem. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each poem fragment layers density until the final line reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift of identity, though the causal linkage between molting and this insight could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted library’s flickering bulbs and corrugated metal act as micro-setting that constrains Cedar’s hiding of the tin and shapes the hushed collaboration with Marla. Sensory detail is selective—scuffing boots, moth-wing coat—filtered through Cedar’s scavenger gaze. The moon’s climb tracks time and charges the final silver glow that frames the blooming image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Cedar can keep integrating fractured selves—tightens when the new poem forces a stance shift. Pressure accumulates via the tin’s weight and the moon’s ascent; the final reconfiguration forecloses the option of endless rebuilding. Cost is legible in the acceptance of perpetual flux, though external stakes remain muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>“Blooming resistance” emerges organically from decaying books and patched coats; the theme avoids moralizing by letting the final poem reweight the concept without exposition. Subtext lives in Marla’s silence and the shared act of sorting—order wrested from entropy. The ending’s ambiguity invites reflection on whether beauty requires embracing, not fixing, anarchy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cedar’s voice carries a scavenger’s lyricism—“moth’s wings,” “desperate fireflies”—that modulates under stress to clipped fragments. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Dialogue with Marla is spare and subtextual, her wind-chime laugh a distinct counterpoint to Cedar’s internal cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous fracture against the darkness”) edge toward overwriting. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—longer lines for reverie, fragments for the molt. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One typo: “a earthquake” should be “an earthquake.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vagrant poet who molts personalities monthly is a fresh angle; the prison-library friendship as crucible for poetic resistance feels non-obvious. Transformation test passes—swap setting or object and the emotional arc collapses. Risk in lyrical fragmentation is justified by the closure’s coherence.</comment>
