<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Queen’s interior conflict is mostly stated: “tired of being a queen who feels nothing,” rather than embodied contradiction; her shift at the end is signalled (“understood”) but left off-stage, softening earned cost. Yet her embodied climb and visceral reaction to pooling starlight keep her particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—the choice to turn back carries felt ambiguity—but the pivot “You are not disenchanted…” is delivered by didactic oracle, not enacted by the queen, so the decisive change remains externalized rather than internally paid on-page, slightly eroding final cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Vivid, sensory terrain (“cobalt grotto…bruise beneath her feet,” “pooling in her palms like liquid silver”) anchors POV attention and steers footing decisions; ember-lit walls actively constrain movement and perception during climax. No object or setting recurs with added cost in the final image, keeping it short of 9-point constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake—“unravel the dreams”—is announced early; the climb’s difficulty supplies escalating pressure under a situational lens: coherent but externalized voice in grotto crystallizes renunciation with no on-page physical cost, keeping the tightening more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Thematic bleed: queen as wound, queen as light. Emerges cleanly from grotto imagery—“this place is a wound”—and ends in refusal without sermonizing. Subtext of fear vs rule remains viable ambiguity though not radically deepened on exit.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Interior texture leans lyrical with compressed diction (“the air smelled…lacy menace”). Pattern of chiaroscuro perception is maintained throughout; voice consistent, no head-hop.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythm variety and visceral diction in climb and grotto moments; occasional template cadence (“she pulled…she stepped…she waited”) repeats mild loop. Mixed metaphors absent. Line-level clarity high, no fogging of closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Star-bleeding stone is evocative, but queen-ascends-to-confront-shadow-oracle veers archetypal; lacks fresh specificity in the final exchange. Still, integration with dream-palimpsest keeps the whole recognizably its own.</comment>
