<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—guilt, defiance, need to overwrite his father’s lies—are embodied in the lattice’s bite and his hovering. The final “I’m writing” stance is earned by prior beats where the lattice blooms and the doppelgänger demands authorship. Cost is visible: the copperlight dims to silver, the chamber dissolves, and the ghost’s pride is silent. Interiority stays concrete, though the father-ghost’s pressure is more atmospheric than interpersonal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias rewrites the inherited story, foreclosing the path of mere repetition. The lattice’s shift from key to pen is the decisive image; cost is the chamber’s dissolution and the reef’s exposed maw. Causal chain holds: father’s lies → Elias enters → lattice teaches → Elias writes. Orientation is anchored early by “lighthouse prison’s air” and “jagged reef.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison, reef, copperlight, and salt air are vivid and selective, filtering through Elias’s guilt-tuned perception. The lattice functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its ironwork blooms only when Elias commits to truth. Spatial choreography is coherent; the spiral stairs and circular chamber track cleanly. Environment charges the final image: the reef’s “jagged maw” mirrors the cost of rewriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—overwrite the father’s false stories—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: the lattice demands authorship, forcing Elias to choose story over escape. Cost is the chamber’s collapse and the looming discovery of bodies. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the copperlight’s shift to silver marks the decisive intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between inherited lies and self-authored truth, crystallized in the lattice’s transformation. Subtext operates in the ghost’s silence at the end and the doppelgänger’s vanishing. The final image—Elias hovering above the reef—offers a non-literal answer: authorship sustains impossibility. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unseen bodies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with salt, brine, and copperlight woven into syntax. Perceptual signature is Elias’s: every detail is filtered through inherited guilt and wonder. Compression (“copperlight repose,” “wind through a keyhole”) is taught early and paid off. No POV drift; the ghost’s hiss and the doppelgänger’s rasp are distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters around the lattice and reef without muddling causality. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during confrontation, longer cadences in reflection. Minor loop: “hovered…hovering” in adjacent beats. Otherwise clean, with strong verbs and sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—ghost father, magic lattice, labyrinth—are transformed through Elias’s specific guilt and the story-as-pen conceit. The synthesis feels inevitable: lies etched in iron must be overwritten by living story. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
