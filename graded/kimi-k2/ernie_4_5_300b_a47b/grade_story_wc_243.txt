<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but her final “realization” is more stated than dramatized; the locket and ink ritual carry ancestral weight yet the cost of her choice remains abstract. No contradictory impulse is staged in-scene to force a visible renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant’s survival is reweighted from sacrifice to attention, with the jetty’s closing flowers as felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of small acts steeping into legend—but the decisive shift is articulated more than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty, nightshade roots, and salt-jasmine air are vivid and selective; the driftwood post and locket serve as micro-setting that constrains Elara’s ritual. Final image of flowers closing in prayer recharges the covenant’s fragility with environmental cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the covenant through small acts—is signaled early and tightened by the thinning magic. Pressure deepens as Elara confronts the photo’s joy against inevitable fade, but the escalation is more reflective than causal; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-preservation emerges organically from ritual detail and ancestral echo; final image reframes covenant as ongoing story rather than spell. Avoids moralizing, yet the resonance feels slightly safe—complexity is hinted but not fully risked.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and POV-consistent; sensory diction (“bruise of violets and gold,” “ink drank it greedily”) is character-bound. Rhythm modulates with twilight deepening; no head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned. Minor scaffold in repeated “through proximate causes” refrain and near-paraphrase of covenant definition, but no artifact touches closure. Read-aloud rhythm is assured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of archival magic and ecological covenant; transformation of mundane gestures into myth feels inevitable. Risk is moderate—stakes remain intimate—but specificity of walnut ink and blooming jetty anchors the concept. Slight familiarity in elegiac coastal mood tempers full novelty.</comment>
