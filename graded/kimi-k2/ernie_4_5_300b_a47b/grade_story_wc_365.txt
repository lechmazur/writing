<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—yearning for truth vs. fear of its cost—are embodied in the shard’s throb and his trembling hands. The final renunciation feels earned because the shard has steadily overridden his caution. Interiority is concrete: “the weight of the withheld truth crashed over him.” Minor slip: the parallel-universe mother is sketched more as emblem than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard’s pull → portal jump → confrontation → renunciation, each beat tightening options. Closure is a decisive change (hurling the shard) with felt cost: “his hands trembled.” Orientation is anchored early; the single transition is legible. One causal gap: how the shard’s override actually interfaces with the visor tech.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bay’s rusted gantries and ozone scent ground the stakes; the gleaming alternate bay mirrors the cost of reopened doors. Micro-setting—the platform sinking like quicksand—constrains the jump. Shard’s green flare charges the final image. A hairline slip: spatial relation between ship and platform momentarily floats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. safety—signaled in mother’s hologram and sharpened by shard’s compulsion. Escalation: each beat narrows Kael’s agency until renunciation is the only path left. Cost is visible: loss of shard and of reunion. One intensifier—“roar of colliding realities”—feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: seeking truth becomes learning to relinquish it. Subtext in mother’s smile that “didn’t reach her eyes.” Final image—quiet bay, weight gone—reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries yet risks a faint platitude: “truth was a thread.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s sensory map-maker perception: “colors only he could see.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the fall, longer reflection after. No head-hopping; parallel-mother’s interior is wisely withheld. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction intrudes in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid: “dust motes swirled… catching faint hues.” No loops or scaffold. Metaphors serve pressure—“platform like quicksand.” Minor overwriting: “roar of colliding realities” could be sharper. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Multiverse rescue of lost parent is familiar, but the shard as irreversible key and the choice to discard it freshen the arc. Specific occupation (map-maker) shapes perception and stakes. Risk taken in quiet ending pays off. Avoids overt genre tropes yet feels inevitable.</comment>
