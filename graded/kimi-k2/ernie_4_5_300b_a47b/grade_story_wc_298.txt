<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—reckless forward motion vs. need for gentleness—are dramatized in the sewing scene; the micro-choice to pierce bone and stitch regret is embodied, costly, and specific. Interiority avoids label-speak, using tactile detail (“knees sinking into soft earth”) to externalize shame. The earned shift from certainty to doubt is credible and scaled to the word count. Minor slip: “patch the holes in her soul” edges toward therapeutic shorthand, though it is immediately grounded in the sewing action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: eating the fruit crystallizes her stance—recklessness now tempered by doubt—at visible cost (bitter juice, pulse of another heartbeat). Causal chain holds: Fool card → sewing → fruit → reweighted self. Orientation is swift; the half-light corridor anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern (density of roots, bones, fungi) tightens to the final glow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: torchlight, bioluminescent fungi, bone-fed roots all constrain movement and echo internal decay. The skeleton beneath the final tree functions as micro-setting that literally supports the stitching act. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—soft earth on knees, heartbeat in fruit. One minor drift: “amber and violet” sky at exit feels postcard after the subterranean specificity, but it serves as tonal release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repair soul or remain broken—is signaled early and tightened once: the sewing scene forces a trade-off between clinging to certainty and accepting doubt. Cost is visceral (needle through bone, bitter fruit). Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversals needed. Coincidence absent; every turn flows from Lirael’s consent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme of recklessness transmuted into “fiercely gentle” wisdom emerges through concrete particulars—Fool card, bone needle, black fruit—never stated. Final image reweights prior failures as fertile soil; ambiguity lingers without confusion. No moralizing; the orchard’s rule (“from ash, new growth”) is shown, not preached.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and POV-locked: “torches flickered like souls trapped between worlds” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final golden glow. Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during stitching, longer cadences in reflection. Keeper’s diction (“trammel your fate”) is distinct yet consistent with mythic register. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; “roots coiling like serpents” is earned by prior bone-snake imagery. Metaphors cohere under orchard logic. One near-muddle: “fiercely gentle blade” risks oxymoron, but the context (doubt cutting illusion) justifies it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot necromancy grafted onto root-bone orchard feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The Fool’s journey inverted—ending in bone, not air—reconfigures trope with earned cost. Specificity of spider-silk thread and moonlight needle anchors the fantastical in tactile detail. Risky choice to climax on quiet ingestion rather than spectacle pays off.</comment>
