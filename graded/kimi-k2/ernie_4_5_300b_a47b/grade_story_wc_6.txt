<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira’s guilt, restlessness, and inherited identity are embodied through tactile micro-choices—drilling the coin, splinting the wing, letting the grain fall—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The internal contradiction (firefighter daughter of an arsonist) is dramatized, not stated, and the final renunciation of the coin carries visible cost. Secondary characters apply immediate pressure, but Mara’s arc resolves too quickly to serve as a true crucible, capping the score just below 8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece tracks under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lagoon, coin, and sand accrue symbolic weight until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single-scene default is met. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira’s release of the grain crystallizes her stance and forecloses the path of clinging to inherited guilt. The cost is felt in the relinquishing of the coin’s anchor, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, and migrating clouds are vividly selective, filtered through Lira’s firefighter gaze. The sand’s hiss and the coin’s jingle constrain her choices—she uses both to splint the wing and to let go. Spatial choreography is coherent; the dunes, shoreline, and sky remain stable. The setting charges the final image when the black grain vanishes into the lagoon, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens when Lira must choose between clinging to the coin’s guilt or releasing it to heal Mara’s bird. Agency is clear: her decision to drill, string, and ultimately surrender the coin drives the escalation. The cost is visible when she loosens her grip on the past. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the external conflict (arguing adults) dissipates without altering tactics, keeping the score below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: volcanic soil coaxing life from ash mirrors Lira’s attempt to grow compassion from inherited fire. The coin’s transformation from talisman to splint to relinquished weight reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the bird’s flight answers the thematic question wordlessly. The final image reweights the premise: scars don’t forget, they learn to sing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is textured, tactile, and firefighter-specific: “the sand hissed like a secret,” “heartbeat fluttered against her skin.” Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (“You’re the firefighter… the one who… you know”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer lyric lines in reflection—without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; no mixed metaphors or loops. The final paragraph’s syntactic cadence mirrors the lagoon’s lap, tightening toward closure. Minor filter verbs (“she thought”) are voice-motivated and rare.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter healing a bird with a drilled coin—feels fresh yet inevitable. Familiar tropes (guilt, redemption) are transformed through volcanic sand and migrating clouds. The risk of quiet lyric closure pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
