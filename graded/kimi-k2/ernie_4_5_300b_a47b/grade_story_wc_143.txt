<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and sense of legacy are palpable, but the interiority drifts into summary (“she’d come here tonight to photograph…”) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the final smile feels slightly unearned because the drones’ indifference never truly threatens her plan.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the gas spiral and archival shadow crystallize the cost of human persistence against automated erasure. Causal chain is tight—dawn triggers the grain, drones arrive, photo endures—though the drones’ timing is convenient rather than driven by her choices.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit is vividly sketched—“silver path through the dust,” “cold silence softened”—and the crater’s sharp rim constrains the placement of the vial. Earth’s crescent on the horizon mirrors the loneliness, but the setting never physically impedes or enables her action beyond mood.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—leaving a human mark before automation erases it—tightens once when the drones’ ETA appears. The cost is conceptual (obsolescence), but the on-page price is muted; she loses nothing tangible except time already spent.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The theme of impermanence versus human care emerges through the hourglass grain and archival shadow, never sermonized. The final image reweights the premise: a single silhouette against the void asserts that “some truths… just need to exist,” a resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and science-grounded (“crater-inspection visor,” “luminescent gas”) without slipping into jargon. The perceptual signature is intimate—“glow of her suit’s headlamp carving a silver path”—and the compression of time (“04:57… 05:13”) feels intentional rather than rushed.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic; only occasional softeners (“purposefully curious,” “quiet, persistent truth”) flirt with cliché. No loops or scaffold, and the final paragraph’s cadence earns its hush. A stray “she’d outlasted the drones’ indifference” edges toward summary but doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of chemical love-letter and lunar obsolescence feels fresh; the hourglass grain as micro-capsule message is a specific, non-obvious device. Risk is modest—quiet elegy rather than twist—but the synthesis of personal relic and cosmic silence is memorable.</comment>
