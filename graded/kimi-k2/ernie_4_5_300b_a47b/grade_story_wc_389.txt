<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s isolation and obsession are embodied in tactile radio work and storm-touch, but interiority drifts into lyric summary (“to shape a new dawn…”) rather than contradiction under pressure; final laugh is earned yet cost feels abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm, voices, and prismatic light build density toward Charged Poise—“You are the prism. You are the storm.” Closure lands with conceptual cost (time’s arrow questioned) though causal linkage is more atmospheric than sequential.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Observatory above clouds, cobalt glass, volcanic hourglass—each object is handled, refracted, and finally reweighted in the prismatic climax, constraining Kael’s stance; storm’s sensory grip is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harnessing the storm’s language—tightens via escalating transmissions and the prism mechanism; cost is conceptual (fragility embraced) but felt through the hourglass’s gravity-defying swirl.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of embracing fragility emerges from storm-tech synthesis; final image of glowing threshold offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in radio riddles and reversed sand carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature (lightning as circuit board, “lyrically prophetic” static) remains character-bound. Occasional elevated diction (“civilization that had mastered the storm”) slightly drifts but pattern holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors occasionally stack (“jagged fingers streaking… cobalt glass… volcanic glass”) but serve texture. No loops or scaffold; final chord image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Storm-engineered prophecy reframed through solitary radio mystic feels fresh; synthesis of ancient voices and prismatic tech avoids cliché. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure.</comment>
