<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradictory impulses—hunger for truth vs. reverence for ancestral silence—are embodied in the tremor of her hand and the steadiness of the crank. The micro-choice to insert the handle into the secret groove crystallizes her hierarchy of values and costs her the comfort of ignorance. Backstory is tightly cued to present action (father’s fevered grip on the crank). Only slight over-articulation of “dynasty ender” as label keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty’s end is reweighted from tragedy to deliberate sacrifice, with the felt cost of Lirael’s tears. Causal chain (crank → standing waves → hidden letters) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each turn deepens pattern rather than reverses plot. Orientation is anchored by 120-word mark. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sepia reading room, gramophone, and crank handle form a micro-setting that constrains every move: the desk’s false bottom is unlocked only by the crank’s frequency. Sensory hierarchy (cold brass, golden shadows) is filtered through Lirael’s selective attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The room evolves from tomb to cradle, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover truth vs. preserve ancestral silence—tightens once when the letters reveal the dynasty’s self-erasure. Escalation is driven by Lirael’s agency (turning the crank, pressing the handle). Cost is legible: she forfeits the myth of tragic downfall for the burden of conscious rebirth. Slight abstraction in “too dangerous to speak” keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence as eloquent sacrifice emerges from concrete particulars (letters bound in twine, brass heartbeat) rather than assertion. Final image of the room as cradle offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext operates in the ghost’s wordless “Listen” and the unspoken weight of the letters. Avoids tidy moral binaries; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to quiet between notes and the pulse of brass. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during the hum’s peak. No head-hopping or register drift. Free indirect style is clean; “she swore she saw” maintains modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or knowledge. Figurative language is selective (“liquid gold,” “bridge of intuition”) and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she realized,” “she felt”) in one beat tempers the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar dynastic-secret frame is transformed through the acoustic mechanism of standing waves and the inversion of tragedy into voluntary silence. Specificity of the gramophone’s frequency-locked compartment feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in the lyric compression; it heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight proximity to “hidden letters” trope keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>
