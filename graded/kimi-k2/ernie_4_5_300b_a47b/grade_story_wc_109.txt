<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her aching fingers, the quill’s resistance—but the “mild obsession” never complicates her choices; it merely labels her. The final smile feels unearned because no contradictory impulse or visible cost is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing map reweights the premise by turning absence into presence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each summarized silence layers density until the final image—but the cost is only conceptual; no concrete forfeiture is shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fort’s “stone teeth” and groaning walls are tactile and selective, filtering through Mara’s sea-attuned perception. The booklet’s gold flakes become micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens once when the last star vanishes, forcing completion. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as palimpsest of unspoken truths. The final glowing map offers a non-literal answer—absence as illumination—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices mortar cracks “as if deciphering a language only the sea understood.” No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative pattern. No loops or clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of cartography-by-silence feels fresh and inevitable; the risk of mapping absence rather than presence heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
